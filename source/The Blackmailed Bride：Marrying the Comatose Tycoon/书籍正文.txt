###Chapter 1

The grand wedding of Ravenswood socialite Evelyn Thorne was underway, yet the groom was conspicuously absent.

Dominic Blackwood, the intended groom, had been in a vegetative state since a tragic car accident six months prior. His doctors had grimly predicted he wouldn’t survive the year.

In a desperate bid to see her son married before his untimely demise, Dominic’s mother, Eleanor Blackwood, had orchestrated this union.

The Blackwoods were among the wealthiest families in Ravenswood, yet no woman in her right mind would willingly tie herself to a man on death’s doorstep.

——

Evelyn sat before the vanity, her slender frame draped in an exquisite white wedding gown. Delicate makeup accentuated her porcelain complexion, making her resemble a freshly bloomed rose—soft, beautiful, and fragile.

But her almond-shaped eyes betrayed unease.

With only twenty minutes until the ceremony, her fingers flew across her phone screen, her heart pounding as she waited for a reply to a message she had sent hours ago.

Before being forced into this marriage, Evelyn had been in a secret relationship with Dominic’s nephew, Julian Whitmore.

Last night, she had begged Julian to run away with her—to escape this farce of a wedding.

She had stayed awake all night, staring at her phone, but no response ever came.

She couldn’t wait any longer.

Evelyn stood abruptly, clutching her phone, and made up an excuse to step out of the room.

Hurrying down the corridor, she froze when she passed a slightly ajar door.

From inside, she heard her half-sister Victoria’s delighted laughter, followed by Julian’s voice.

"I bet my foolish sister is still waiting for you to rescue her, Julian! Maybe you should go reassure her one last time. What if she changes her mind and backs out?"

"She has no choice now," Julian murmured, his lips brushing Victoria’s neck. "Even if she tries to run, the guards will drag her down that aisle by her hair."

Victoria giggled wickedly. "Evelyn would lose her mind if she knew you’ve been in my bed every night."

A violent buzzing filled Evelyn’s skull. She staggered back, gripping the wall for balance.

Her fists clenched in the fabric of her gown, nails digging into her palms as she fought back tears.

Her father had been hospitalized after Thornfield Industries collapsed.

Her stepmother, Margaret Thorne, had seized the opportunity to force Evelyn into this marriage, disguising it as a sacrifice for the family’s survival. But Evelyn knew the truth—this was Margaret’s way of discarding her.

And now, the man who had sworn to love her had betrayed her too.

No wonder Julian had urged her to go through with the wedding. He had promised to marry her after Dominic’s death—but it had all been a lie.

Every hope she had clung to shattered in an instant.

As the voices inside the room grew more intimate, Evelyn’s expression hardened.

For years, she had endured her stepmother and stepsister’s cruelty for her father’s sake. She had swallowed every injustice, believing it was her duty.

How foolish she had been.

No more.

She would no longer be their pawn.

She would take back everything they had stolen from her.

——

The ceremony began shortly after.

Clutching her bouquet, Evelyn walked down the aisle alone, the soft strains of a romantic melody filling the grand hall.

She recited her vows to an empty space and slid the wedding ring onto her own finger.

The guests exchanged confused glances, but she ignored them.

From this moment on, she was Mrs. Blackwood—untouchable.

But her new husband, the man who had once ruled Eldermere with an iron fist, had mere months left to live.

——

That evening, Evelyn was escorted to Dominic’s mansion in the heart of St. Elric District—a sprawling estate worth over 150 million dollars.

Before she could take in the opulence, Mrs. Wilkins, the stern housekeeper, ushered her straight to the master bedroom.

Her breath caught at the sight of the man lying motionless on the massive bed.

Dominic’s sharp, aristocratic features were still striking despite his pallor. His strong jawline, high cheekbones, and the faint shadow of stubble gave him an air of regal authority, even in unconsciousness.

Had he been healthy, a woman like Evelyn would never have been allowed near him.

Before the accident, Dominic Blackwood had been a titan of industry—the ruthless CEO of Blackwood Group, one of Eldermere’s most powerful corporations.

Rumors painted him as a man with connections in both the boardroom and the underworld. Those who crossed him never lived to regret it.

And now, against all odds, Evelyn was his wife.

The bedroom door creaked open, pulling her from her thoughts.

Julian stood there, his expression carefully arranged into one of concern.

"Evel—Mrs. Blackwood," he corrected with false deference. "I’m sorry I couldn’t get to you sooner. Things were… complicated today."

"You’re addressing me incorrectly," Evelyn said coldly. "I just married your uncle. Show some respect."

Julian’s eyes flickered with irritation before he forced a smile. "I know you’re upset. But I didn’t run away with you because I didn’t want you to suffer. Dominic is already dead in all but name. Once he’s gone, I’ll make sure you inherit everything. Then we can finally be together."

He reached for her hands, his voice dripping with false sincerity. "His fortune will be ours."

The memory of him tangled with Victoria flashed in Evelyn’s mind. Disgust coiled in her stomach.

"Don’t touch me!" She wrenched her hands away, her voice sharp enough to make Julian flinch.

Since when had Evelyn ever spoken to him like this?

She had always been soft-spoken, pliant—never defiant.

Had she discovered his betrayal?

Panic flickered in Julian’s eyes. He stepped closer, ready to spin another lie—

Then his gaze locked on something behind Evelyn. His face drained of color.

"H-He—" he stammered, pointing.

Evelyn turned.

Dominic’s fingers twitched.

Then, slowly, his eyes opened.
###Chapter 2

The crystal chandelier cast shimmering light across the room, illuminating Dominic's piercing dark eyes that seemed to hold ancient secrets and hidden dangers.

That intense gaze alone could freeze blood in one's veins.

Julian's face drained of color as he staggered backward several steps.

"Evelyn... I mean, Aunt Evelyn... It's late, I shouldn't disturb you and Uncle Dominic any longer!"

Cold sweat drenched Julian's shirt as he practically tripped over himself fleeing the bedroom.

Evelyn's chest constricted watching his terrified escape, her body beginning to shake uncontrollably.

Was Dominic awake? Wasn't he supposed to be dying?

Her throat closed up when she tried to speak. She wanted to examine him closer, but her feet might as well have been rooted to the floor.

Overwhelming fear crashed over her like a tidal wave, sending her stumbling toward the staircase.

"Mrs. Wilkins! Dominic's awake! His eyes opened!" Evelyn cried out, her voice trembling.

The housekeeper came rushing up the grand staircase at Evelyn's distressed call.

"Master Dominic opens his eyes daily, Madam, but that doesn't signify consciousness. See? He's not responding to any stimuli," Mrs. Wilkins explained gently before adding with a sigh, "The specialists said the chances of someone in a vegetative state regaining awareness are... negligible."

Evelyn still felt uneasy but nodded. "Could we leave the lights on tonight? I'm feeling rather unsettled."

"Of course, Madam," Mrs. Wilkins agreed. "Try to get some rest. You're expected at the family estate tomorrow morning. I'll wake you at seven."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured.

After Mrs. Wilkins departed, Evelyn changed into silk pajamas and slipped into the massive four-poster bed.

She sat rigidly beside Dominic's motionless form, studying his aristocratic features. Tentatively, she waved a hand before his unblinking eyes.

"What are you thinking about, Dominic?" she whispered, receiving no reaction.

A sudden ache filled Evelyn's chest. Her own suffering paled in comparison to his silent ordeal.

"I hope you wake soon. If that snake Julian gets his greedy hands on your empire, you'll be rolling in your grave."

At that precise moment, Dominic's eyelids slowly drifted shut.

Evelyn gasped, her pulse skyrocketing as she stared at his still face.

Some vegetative patients retain awareness. Had he actually heard her?

She curled up beside him, nerves still jangling. After several minutes, she exhaled shakily.

For now, she was legally Mrs. Blackwood - untouchable.

But what would the Blackwoods do to her once Dominic passed?

The thought made her stomach clench.

She had to leverage her position before it was too late, reclaim everything stolen from her while Dominic still drew breath.

Every single person who'd wronged her would face retribution.

◆◆◆

At precisely eight the next morning, Mrs. Wilkins escorted Evelyn to the ancestral Blackwood estate to meet Eleanor Blackwood.

The entire family had gathered in the opulent drawing room when Evelyn arrived. With practiced grace, she served tea to each relative in order of seniority.

Eleanor observed Evelyn's perfect etiquette with satisfaction. A compliant daughter-in-law would be far easier to manipulate.

"Did you sleep well last night, dear?" Eleanor inquired sweetly.

Evelyn's cheeks pinkened. "Quite well, thank you."

"And Dominic? He didn't... disturb you?"

Evelyn recalled Dominic's devastatingly handsome yet lifeless face. "He was perfectly still. No trouble at all."

Though motionless, his body radiated warmth. In her sleep, she'd unconsciously curled against him like a living pillow, only to wake mortified in the wee hours.

"I have a little gift for you," Eleanor announced, producing an exquisite amethyst box. She revealed a diamond tennis bracelet that sparkled under the chandelier. "This complements your complexion beautifully. Do you like it?"

Evelyn couldn't refuse in front of the entire family. "It's stunning. Thank you."

Eleanor patted her hand. "I know this situation is difficult, my dear. With Dominic's condition, he can't properly care for you. But there is a way you could benefit greatly." The older woman's eyes gleamed. "Dominic's time grows short. He dedicated his life to business, never marrying or..." she paused meaningfully, "...fathering an heir."

Evelyn's spine stiffened.

An heir?

Was Eleanor suggesting...?

"I want you to carry Dominic's child and continue the Blackwood bloodline," Eleanor declared.

The room erupted in shocked murmurs. Evelyn's mouth fell open.

"Mother, Dominic's been ill for years. He may be sterile," Gregory Blackwood interjected.

Though Dominic still breathed, the vultures already circled his fortune.

Eleanor chuckled darkly. "The doctors have their methods. With Dominic's empire at stake, we must secure an heir. Even a daughter would suffice."

Suddenly, every eye in the room locked onto Evelyn.
###Chapter 3

Evelyn's fingers trembled against her teacup.

The porcelain felt unnaturally cold against her skin, mirroring the chill running down her spine.

"Surely you're still attending university, Evelyn?" Victoria's voice dripped with false concern. "A pregnancy would disrupt your education terribly."

Gregory nodded vigorously. "Exactly! At your age, you should be focusing on your future, not changing diapers!"

Eleanor's sharp gaze cut through their objections. The matriarch's lips pressed into a thin line as she studied Evelyn's reaction.

"Tell me truthfully, child," Eleanor demanded, leaning forward. "Would you carry Dominic's heir? Understand this - you and the baby would inherit everything. More wealth than you could spend in three lifetimes."

Evelyn didn't blink. "I'll do it."

The words tasted bitter, but necessary. Anything to keep Julian's greedy hands off the Blackwood fortune.

And let's be honest, she thought bitterly, they'd make me do it anyway.

Eleanor's face transformed, wrinkles smoothing with delight. "Marvelous! I knew you had more sense than those other empty-headed girls. They ran screaming from a dying man's bed like fools!"

The tea concluded with forced pleasantries. Evelyn fled the oppressive mansion, desperate for fresh air.

Julian intercepted her at the gates.

Sunlight glinted off his too-perfect smile. Somewhere, a mockingbird sang.

Bile rose in Evelyn's throat.

"Mrs. Wilkins, would you take these inside?" Evelyn thrust the gift boxes at the housekeeper without breaking eye contact with Julian.

The moment they were alone, Julian's mask slipped. "How could you?" he hissed. "You wouldn't even let me hold your hand, but now you'll spread your legs for a vegetable?"

Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "For billions? I'd do far worse."

Julian's nostrils flared. Then, suddenly, he smirked. "Clever girl. But here's a better plan - we make the baby together. Who's to know it's not Uncle Dominic's? The bloodline stays pure, and Grandmother would never risk harming a potential heir."

Evelyn's amusement vanished. "Ambition's admirable, Julian. Stupidity less so."

She stepped closer, voice dropping to a whisper. "Do you truly believe Dominic's wolves would let us live if they discovered the fraud? That man may be comatose, but his pack still watches."

Julian paled. He knew better than most how Dominic's inner circle operated - shadows with teeth.

"I was joking!" he backpedaled. "Of course the child should be his! I'd treat my little cousin like royalty!"

"Cousin?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Not stepchild?"

Julian's expression turned queasy. "Semantics. We'll discuss this after... you know."

"And if he never dies?" Evelyn challenged. "Will you remain celibate waiting for me?"

His silence spoke volumes.

With a derisive chuckle, Evelyn turned away. "Eleanor's sending doctors to Dominic's estate. Best not keep them waiting."

The Blackwood mansion's medical suite gleamed with sterile efficiency.

Two white-coated professionals guided Evelyn through a battery of tests. Ovulation checks. Hormone panels. The works.

"Don't be nervous, Mrs. Blackwood," the female doctor soothed as needles glinted under fluorescent lights. "A little discomfort now guarantees your future."

Evelyn lay back on the examination table, pulse racing.

"How soon until... conception?" she asked.

The doctors exchanged glances.

"That," said the male doctor, adjusting his glasses, "depends entirely on your body's cooperation."
###Chapter 4

The doctor hesitated before answering.

"If fortune favors us, three to four months. If not… it could be indefinite."

She softened her tone. "But you're young. The odds are in your favor."

Time slipped away unnoticed. The crisp air of autumn settled over Ravenswood.

Evelyn stepped out of the shower, her skin still damp.

She perched on the edge of the bed, uncapping the new moisturizer she'd picked up earlier. The rich cream glided smoothly between her fingers as she worked it into her skin.

"Dominic," she mused, turning toward him. "This weather is drying everything out. Want some?"

Without waiting for an answer—not that she expected one—she moved to his side.

Her fingertips traced his cheekbones, applying the cream with gentle strokes.

Then—

His eyes snapped open.

Dark amber, sharp as cut gemstones, locking onto hers with startling intensity.

Evelyn's breath hitched.

She saw his eyes open every day, but this—this was different.

"Too rough?" She kept her voice light, though her pulse betrayed her. "I'm barely pressing."

Her fingers lingered, smoothing the cream over his jaw.

A quiet laugh escaped her.

"Internet says you've never had a girlfriend because of your condition. But honestly?" She patted his arm. "You're not bad. Strong shoulders. Good muscle tone—"

Then—

A sound.

Low. Guttural.

Her hands froze.

"Dominic?" She jerked back, nearly stumbling off the bed. "Was that you?"

Her wide eyes met his.

And this time—this time, there was no mistaking it.

His gaze burned with something she'd never seen before. Not emptiness. Not vacancy.

Rage. Distrust.

A living, breathing glare.

"Mrs. Wilkins!" Evelyn bolted downstairs, her voice cracking. "He's awake! Dominic just spoke!"

Her heart hammered against her ribs.

Awake.

Not just open-eyed. Not just breathing.

Alive.

And the first words out of his mouth had been a demand—Who are you?

The house erupted into chaos within minutes.

Mrs. Wilkins arrived first, then the doctor, then the security team. Soon, the room was packed with stunned faces.

"I knew you'd come back to us!" Eleanor Blackwood wept, clutching her son's hand.

Gregory exhaled sharply. "Mother hasn't slept properly since the accident. You have no idea what this means."

The doctor's hands trembled as he checked Dominic's vitals. "A medical miracle. With rehabilitation, full recovery is possible."

Eleanor swayed on her feet. The shock was too much—she collapsed into Gregory's arms.

As they carried her out, Evelyn hovered near the doorway, suddenly uncertain.

The air in the room had changed.

Dominic sat upright, his spine rigid against the headboard. His stare cut through the space between them like a blade.

Cold. Calculating.

"Who," he repeated, each syllable dripping with venom, "is she?"

The doctor flinched. Mrs. Wilkins bowed her head.

"Master Dominic, this is Evelyn Thorne. Your wife. Madam arranged the marriage while you were—"

"Get her out."

His voice cracked like a whip.

Evelyn didn't wait to be told twice.
###Chapter 5

Evelyn was so startled that she stumbled backward, her heart pounding wildly in her chest.

Dominic was like a predator emerging from the shadows—silent, lethal, and utterly terrifying. When he had been unconscious, there had been an eerie stillness about him. But now, awake, his presence was suffocating, his gaze sharp enough to cut through steel.

Mrs. Wilkins stepped out of the room and closed the door softly behind her.

She took one look at Evelyn, who stood frozen like a deer in headlights, and offered a gentle smile. "Don't be afraid, Madam. Master Dominic has just woken up. He needs time to adjust. Let me show you to the guest room for tonight. We can discuss everything in the morning. Lady Eleanor adores you—she may yet sway him in your favor."

Evelyn's mind was a whirlwind of panic. She had prepared herself for the possibility of Dominic never waking up. But this? This was something she hadn't dared consider.

"Mrs. Wilkins, my things—they're still in the master bedroom," Evelyn said, casting a nervous glance toward the closed door.

After the venomous glare Dominic had thrown her way, she doubted he would ever accept her as his wife. She needed to be ready to leave at a moment's notice.

Mrs. Wilkins sighed. "If it's nothing urgent, leave it for now. I'll fetch your belongings tomorrow."

Evelyn nodded stiffly. Then, hesitantly, she asked, "Are you… afraid of him?"

"I've served him for years," Mrs. Wilkins replied. "He may seem harsh, but he has never been cruel to me."

Evelyn swallowed hard and said nothing more.

She might be his wife in name, but this was their first real meeting. His hostility wasn't entirely unexpected.

Sleep didn't come easily that night. Evelyn's thoughts were a tangled mess, her future suddenly uncertain. Dominic's awakening had shattered the fragile stability she'd built.

By eight the next morning, Mrs. Wilkins had retrieved Evelyn's belongings from the master bedroom and delivered them to the guest room.

"It's time for breakfast, Madam," she announced. "Master Dominic is already in the dining room. You should join him. Perhaps you can… talk."

Evelyn grimaced. "I doubt he wants to talk to me."

"You still need to eat," Mrs. Wilkins insisted. "Come now. He didn’t even argue when I mentioned Lady Eleanor’s fondness for you. That’s progress."

When Evelyn entered the dining room, her gaze immediately landed on Dominic, seated in his wheelchair.

Despite his condition, his posture was rigid, his presence commanding. If he stood, she imagined he would tower over her, his frame strong and imposing.

Unease coiled in her stomach as she took her seat. Mrs. Wilkins placed a plate in front of her, but Dominic didn’t so much as glance her way.

Evelyn picked up her fork, then hesitated. Against her better judgment, she stole a quick look at him—only to find his dark eyes already fixed on her.

His gaze was like a void, endless and consuming.

"Um… I'm Evelyn Thorne," she managed, her voice unsteady.

Dominic lifted his coffee cup, taking a slow sip before speaking. His voice was ice. "I heard you might be carrying my child."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. Her appetite vanished.

"Would you prefer surgical or medical termination?"

His words were calm, detached, as if discussing the weather.

Evelyn's face drained of color. Her mind went blank.

Mrs. Wilkins, horrified, broke protocol. "Master Dominic, the child was Lady Eleanor’s wish. Madam Evelyn had no say in the matter."

"Don’t use my mother against me," Dominic snapped, his glare silencing her instantly.

"Dominic—" Evelyn began.

"Who gave you permission to use my name?"

Evelyn blinked, then retorted, "What should I call you, then? Darling?"

His lips thinned, fury flashing in his eyes.

Before he could explode, Evelyn hurried to defuse the tension. "I’m not pregnant. I got my period. Ask the maid, Mrs. Dawson, if you don’t believe me. I asked her for a tampon this morning."

Dominic said nothing. He simply took another sip of his coffee.

Evelyn’s stomach twisted, but she forced herself to eat, shoveling food into her mouth as quickly as possible.

The moment she finished, she stood. "I’ll get my bag."

Being near Dominic was unbearable.

"Prepare your documents. We’re divorcing soon," he said coldly.

Evelyn paused, but she wasn’t surprised.

"Today?"

"In a few days."

Lady Eleanor had been so shocked the previous night that she’d been hospitalized for high blood pressure. Dominic wouldn’t finalize anything until she was stable.

"Fine. Let me know when," Evelyn said before fleeing to her room.

Five minutes later, she emerged with her bag—only to freeze at the sight of a familiar figure in the living room.

Julian.

He stood stiffly beside Dominic’s wheelchair, looking like a kicked puppy.

"Uncle Dominic, my parents are at the hospital with Grandmother. Father sent me to check on you," Julian said, gesturing to a box of supplements on the table.

Dominic flicked a glance at his bodyguard.

The man immediately snatched the box and tossed it out the door.

"Uncle Dominic!" Julian yelped. "Those are the finest supplements available! If you don’t like them, I can get something else—please, don’t be angry!"

Before he could finish, another bodyguard kicked the back of his knees, forcing him to the ground.

Evelyn held her breath, stunned.

Dominic was treating his own nephew like this?

"My dear nephew," Dominic drawled, lighting a cigarette. "You must be so disappointed I woke up."

Evelyn’s jaw dropped.

He had just regained consciousness last night, and now he was drinking coffee and smoking? Did he have a death wish?

Julian whimpered, his knees aching. "No! I’m happy you’re awake! I always prayed you’d—"

"Are you arguing with me?" Dominic arched a brow, his tone deceptively mild. "Going to admit you bribed my lawyer now?"

He flicked ash onto Julian’s face, then snarled, "Get out. Piss me off again, and I’ll feed you to the hounds."

Julian scrambled away, trembling.

Evelyn’s pulse raced.

She was terrified.

Terrified of Dominic.

Even a snake like Julian looked pitiful next to him.

She clutched her bag tighter and hurried out, desperate to escape.

She had a doctor’s appointment today.

Her period had been unusually light—something that had never happened before.

At the hospital, she explained her symptoms. The doctor ordered an ultrasound.

An hour later, the results came back.

No signs of uterine bleeding.

But there was a gestational sac.

She was pregnant.
###Chapter 6

The doctor's words struck Evelyn like a lightning bolt. Her hands trembled as she clutched the edge of the examination table.

"Doctor, what if... I don’t want to keep it?"

She was on the verge of divorcing Dominic. A pregnancy now would only complicate everything.

The doctor studied her carefully before speaking. "Why not? Do you know how many women would give anything to be in your position?"

Evelyn bit her lip, her gaze dropping to the floor.

"Where’s the father?" the doctor pressed. "Even if you’re considering termination, he has a right to know."

Evelyn’s fingers curled into fists.

Noticing her discomfort, the doctor flipped through her chart. "You’re only twenty-one? Not married, then?"

"I—it doesn’t matter," Evelyn muttered. The divorce papers would be finalized soon anyway.

"Abortion isn’t a simple procedure. Even if you decide to go through with it, we can’t schedule it today." The doctor handed her the file. "Go home. Think it over. Whatever issues you have with the father, this child is innocent."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

"Given the bleeding, if we don’t act now, we might not be able to save it regardless," the doctor added.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. "What do we need to do?"

"Changed your mind?" The doctor arched a brow. "You’re young and healthy. This baby could be beautiful." She scribbled a prescription. "If you want to proceed, take these. Bed rest for a week, then follow up."

——

The afternoon sun was blinding as Evelyn stepped outside. Sweat clung to her back, her legs leaden.

She had nowhere to go. No one to confide in.

One thing was certain—Dominic could never find out.

If he did, he’d drag her to the operating table himself.

She hadn’t decided yet. Her mind was a storm of conflicting thoughts. She needed time.

Hailing a cab, she headed to her uncle’s house.

Since her parents’ divorce, her mother, Clara, had been staying with Ronald Thorne.

The Thorne residence wasn’t as lavish as the Blackwood estate, but it was comfortable enough.

"Aunt Miranda," Evelyn greeted as the door swung open.

Miranda’s smile vanished the moment she saw Evelyn’s empty hands.

"No gifts this time?" she sneered. "I heard you brought expensive presents to your father’s house last week. Guess we’re not worth the effort."

Evelyn stiffened. "I’m sorry. I’ll bring something next time."

"Next time?" Miranda scoffed. "From the looks of it, you’ve been kicked out of the Blackwood mansion. If Dominic cared, you wouldn’t be running back to Mommy, would you?"

Heat flooded Evelyn’s cheeks.

Clara stepped forward. "Even if she was, that’s no reason to mock her."

"Truth hurts, doesn’t it?" Miranda shot back. "Remember whose roof you’re under. Don’t like it? Leave."

Clara’s jaw tightened, but she said nothing.

Evelyn’s chest ached.

She’d thought her mother was comfortable here. She had no idea it was like this.

"Mom, let’s get you an apartment," Evelyn whispered. "I have some savings—"

Clara nodded. "Give me twenty minutes."

Half an hour later, they were in a cab, suitcases in tow.

"Don’t worry about me," Clara said softly. "I’ve saved enough. I only stayed for your grandmother’s sake."

Evelyn exhaled. "Aunt Miranda wasn’t wrong. The divorce will be final soon."

Clara squeezed her hand. "You’re young. You’ll rebuild your life."

Evelyn leaned against her mother’s shoulder. "After this, let’s live together."

She couldn’t tell her about the baby. Not yet.

——

That night, the Blackwood mansion was eerily silent.

Mrs. Wilkins appeared like a ghost, startling Evelyn.

"Dinner’s ready, Madam. I also picked up the supplies you requested."

"Thank you." Evelyn glanced around. "Is he not home?"

"Master Dominic left against medical advice," Mrs. Wilkins sighed. "Stubborn as always."

Evelyn nodded.

Dominic was ruthless. Arrogant. Unyielding.

Whatever sympathy she’d felt for him while he was unconscious had evaporated.

Sleep didn’t come easily.

The weight of her decision pressed down on her. By morning, she was no closer to an answer.

At 9:30 AM, Mrs. Wilkins knocked. "He’s gone. You can eat now."

Evelyn flushed. Had she been that obvious?

After breakfast, her phone rang.

A classmate offered a translation job—urgent, high-paying, due by noon.

Evelyn needed the money. She accepted.

By 11:30 AM, she’d finished. Just as she was about to send the file, her laptop crashed.

Her stomach dropped—until she remembered the backup on her USB.

"Mrs. Wilkins, is there another computer I can use? Mine just died."

"There’s Master Dominic’s."

Evelyn froze.

Using his computer? Unthinkable.

But the clock was ticking. 11:50 AM.

"If it’s quick, he won’t mind," Mrs. Wilkins urged.

Dominic’s study was off-limits. No one entered except the cleaners.

Evelyn hesitated.

She needed the money. For the abortion—if she chose it.

This child was half his. Using his computer was the least he could contribute.

Steeling herself, she turned it on.

The screen lit up instantly—no password.

Her pulse spiked.

Too easy.
###Chapter 7

The computer wasn’t locked. It booted up instantly.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked at how fast it responded.

She inhaled sharply, plugged in the flash drive, and logged into her email.

Within moments, she’d sent the file to her classmate.

It was unsettling how flawlessly it had gone.

By noon, the task was done.

Evelyn didn’t dare linger. As she moved to shut it down, her fingers slipped.

A file flickered open on the screen.

Her breath hitched as her gaze locked onto the contents.

……

Five minutes later, Evelyn stepped out of the study.

Mrs. Wilkins exhaled in relief. "See? I told you Master Dominic wouldn’t be back so soon."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted. She’d stumbled onto something she shouldn’t have.

She never should’ve touched his computer.

"Are there cameras in the study, Mrs. Wilkins?" Evelyn asked, voice tight.

"Only outside," the housekeeper replied.

Evelyn paled.

"Then he’ll know I was in there."

"Just explain it to him when he returns. It was barely ten minutes. He won’t be too upset," Mrs. Wilkins soothed.

A notification chimed on Evelyn’s phone.

Her classmate had wired her payment—three hundred and twenty dollars.

She hadn’t expected that much for two hours of work.

The money eased the knot in her chest.

She hadn’t meant to snoop.

She’d tell Dominic everything when he got home.

They were divorcing anyway. After that, his secrets wouldn’t matter.

Evelyn retreated to her room after lunch, shutting the door behind her.

At her vanity, she pressed a hand to her still-flat stomach.

"I don’t want to let you go," she whispered. "But keeping you would only make your life harder than mine."

Pregnancy exhaustion pulled her under, and she dozed off at the table.

Frantic footsteps jolted her awake.

Before she could gather herself, the door flew open.

"Madam!" Mrs. Wilkins looked stricken. "Did you tamper with Master Dominic’s computer?"

Evelyn’s throat went dry.

"Is—is he back? Did he find out?"

The housekeeper wrung her hands. "You said you just sent a file! Master Dominic claims you accessed something else. He’s raging in the study! I don’t know how to help you now!"

Evelyn’s heart hammered violently.

One thought consumed her: She was dead.

At this rate, the divorce wouldn’t matter—Dominic might kill her first.

Tears pricked her eyes.

"I’m sorry, Mrs. Wilkins. I didn’t mean to. My hands shook when I tried to close it. I swear, I only glanced before shutting it—"

Mrs. Wilkins believed her, but it didn’t matter.

"He screamed at me. I might lose my job over this."

Evelyn’s pulse roared. She’d face punishment, but she wouldn’t drag the housekeeper down with her.

She marched out, ready to confess.

The elevator doors slid open on the first floor.

A bodyguard wheeled Dominic into the foyer.

The mansion had only three floors, yet an elevator had been installed.

Evelyn’s breath caught as she took in Dominic’s expression—dark, furious, his eyes burning with rage.

She’d expected anger, but not this.

"I’m sorry, Dominic," she choked out. "My laptop crashed this morning. I used your computer without asking. Mrs. Wilkins tried to stop me. This isn’t her fault."

She took full blame.

The bodyguard halted the wheelchair in the living room.

Evelyn forced herself to meet Dominic’s gaze.

His eyes were bloodshot. She’d truly enraged him.

"I’m sorry," she repeated, voice trembling.

"You saw everything, didn’t you?" His tone was lethally quiet.

His hands clenched, knuckles white.

If he weren’t confined to that chair, she had no doubt he’d strangle her.

This reckless, stupid woman.

Did she think she had any right to his things?

Damn her.

Evelyn nodded—then shook her head violently. "I barely remember! I closed it immediately! I didn’t mean to invade your privacy. I was nervous, and my fingers slipped—"

"Silence!" Dominic snarled.

Her excuses sickened him.

"Go to your room. Don’t leave until the divorce is finalized."

Evelyn swallowed her explanations.

She turned and fled.

His loathing was palpable.

The moment her door clicked shut, Dominic’s jaw clenched.

"No meals for her," he told Mrs. Wilkins.

Was he imprisoning and starving her?

The housekeeper pitied Evelyn but didn’t dare argue.

In the Blackwood estate, Dominic’s word was law.

……

Two days later, Eleanor was discharged from the hospital, her blood pressure stabilized.

She headed straight to Dominic’s mansion.

"How’s your recovery, darling?" Eleanor beamed. "What did the doctors say? When will you walk again?"

"The prognosis is good," Dominic replied. "There’s something we need to discuss, Mother."

Eleanor’s smile dimmed. "Is this about your marriage? I arranged it. Evelyn is sweet. I adore her—where is she? You didn’t throw her out, did you?"

"I didn’t," Dominic said coolly, then nodded at Mrs. Wilkins.

The housekeeper hurried toward Evelyn’s room.

Two days without food or water.

She wondered if the girl was even conscious.
###Chapter 8

Evelyn stood frozen in the doorway, her breath catching at the sight before her.

Dominic was curled into himself, arms wrapped tightly around his knees as he leaned against the wall.

His usually immaculate dark hair was disheveled, strands falling haphazardly over his forehead.

At the sound of movement, he lifted his head slowly, his gaze unfocused and distant.

"Dominic!" Evelyn gasped, her pulse spiking at the sight of his ashen face. "What happened to you?"

Her hands trembled as she took in his hollowed cheeks, the cracked dryness of his lips. His breathing was uneven, labored, as if speaking took more effort than he could muster.

Mrs. Wilkins hurried in with a steaming cup of tea, pressing it into Dominic’s hands.

"Drink this, Master Blackwood," she urged softly. "You'll feel better."

Evelyn’s eyes darkened with fury. "He hasn’t been eating?" Her voice was sharp, laced with disbelief. "Is this Evelyn’s doing? Is she starving him?"

The realization hit her like a physical blow.

She stormed into the living room, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor as she confronted her son.

"Dominic, Evelyn is your wife—the one I chose for you. Do you have any idea how this looks? How it makes me feel?"

Dominic’s expression remained cold, detached. "She’s being punished for her mistakes. If not for you, she wouldn’t even be here."

His voice was devoid of emotion, as if discussing the weather rather than a person’s suffering.

"Mistakes? What could she possibly have done?" Evelyn demanded.

In her eyes, Evelyn was nothing but respectful, obedient—far too intelligent to provoke Dominic deliberately.

Dominic’s lips pressed into a thin line, refusing to answer.

"I know why you’ve resisted marriage all these years," Eleanor continued, her voice breaking. "And because I know, I won’t let you destroy this. Evelyn stays. Even if it’s in name only!"

Tears welled in her eyes, her chest heaving with the force of her emotions.

Dominic tensed, about to retaliate, when he noticed the pallor of his mother’s face. He signaled to his bodyguard, who immediately stepped forward to steady her.

"You won’t send her away," Eleanor gasped, her vision swimming. "Not unless you find someone else. I won’t let you spend your life alone—"

Her words cut off as her knees buckled.

Thirty seconds later, Eleanor Blackwood, freshly discharged from the hospital that morning, was rushed back in an ambulance.

Dominic hadn’t anticipated this.

His mother’s stubbornness, her fury—it complicated things.

He despised Evelyn.

But more than that, he despised the idea of any woman in his life.

There would be no replacement. No divorce.

Not yet.

——

In the guest room, Evelyn sipped the tea, the warmth seeping into her bones.

She had heard everything.

Dominic’s cold indifference. His mother’s collapse.

Mrs. Wilkins returned with a bowl of soup, gently brushing Evelyn’s tangled hair aside.

"You heard, Madam," she murmured. "As long as Lady Eleanor is here, Master Dominic won’t send you away."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the spoon.

She had starved for two days. She was exhausted. But one thing was crystal clear.

"I want a divorce," she rasped, her voice raw but firm. "Whether he agrees or not, I’m leaving."

She wouldn’t stay in this nightmare a second longer.

She never wanted to see Dominic Blackwood again.

Mrs. Wilkins hesitated. "Don’t upset yourself, Madam. Eat first. I’ll check on things."

As she stepped out, Dominic’s wheelchair rolled into view.

Mrs. Wilkins stiffened. "Master Dominic, your mother—"

Dominic ignored her, his icy gaze locking onto Evelyn.

The air between them crackled with tension.

"Let’s get a divorce," Evelyn said, setting the bowl aside.

She grabbed her packed suitcase—ready since the night she’d been locked away.

"Marry someone you actually want," she spat.

Dominic’s eyes narrowed. "You hate me that much? You don’t think you deserved this?"

"I made a mistake. I used your computer," Evelyn forced out, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. "I’ve been punished. We’re even. Do you have the papers? If not, I’ll get them myself—"

Dominic cut her off with a dark chuckle. "Did I say your punishment was over?"

Evelyn froze.

The words struck like a physical blow.

"If staying with me is torture," he murmured, "then you’ll remain Mrs. Blackwood a little longer."

His tone left no room for argument.

"We’ll divorce," he added as his bodyguard wheeled him away. "Just not now."

Evelyn watched him go, her nails digging into her palms.

Who was he to decide?

Did he think she wouldn’t find a way?

A wave of dizziness hit her. Her legs gave out, and she barely made it to the bed before collapsing.

She forced herself to breathe.

Dominic hadn’t refused the divorce outright. He was stalling for his mother’s sake.

Fine.

She could wait.

——

A week later, Evelyn recovered enough to visit the hospital.

She was certain she’d lost the baby.

Two days without food. Only water.

No child could survive that.

The doctor ordered an ultrasound.

Evelyn braced herself for the worst.

"Doctor… is the baby gone?"

The doctor frowned. "Why would you think that?"

"I didn’t eat for two days. The baby was already weak—"

"Two days without food isn’t ideal, but it’s not catastrophic," the doctor reassured her. "Some mothers can’t keep anything down for weeks."

Evelyn’s heart pounded.

"So… my baby is—"

"Congrattions," the doctor smiled. "There are two gestational sacs. You’re having twins."
###Chapter 9

The ultrasound showed only one gestational sac.

Evelyn couldn’t believe it. Just a week ago, the doctors had confirmed twins.

Now, she sat on a cold bench in the hospital corridor, clutching the scan in her trembling hands.

The doctor had explained it was rare—vanishing twin syndrome. One had simply… disappeared.

If she terminated now, she might never carry twins again.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. Of course, this was the doing of the Blackwoods’ private physicians.

When they’d implanted the embryos, they hadn’t mentioned twins.

To them, she was just a vessel. A means to an heir.

The bleeding last week had terrified her. She’d thought it was her period. The Blackwoods’ doctors had assumed the procedure failed.

And when Dominic coldly declared he’d divorce her upon waking, they’d abandoned her completely.

Now, the choice was hers alone.

Her phone buzzed in her purse. She’d been sitting here for over an hour.

She pulled it out, stood, and headed for the exit.

“Evelyn! Your father—he’s dying! Come home now!”

Her mother’s voice was raw with panic.

Evelyn froze.

Dying? How?

She knew her father had been hospitalized after Thornfield Industries collapsed. He’d missed her wedding.

But this…? Her mind reeled.

Their relationship had been strained since his affair. Yet, the news still felt like a knife to the chest.

———

The Thorne house was in chaos when she arrived.

Clara led her straight to the master bedroom.

Richard lay motionless, his breathing shallow. When he saw Evelyn, his hand twitched toward her.

“Dad, why didn’t you go to the hospital?” Evelyn grasped his icy fingers. Tears blurred her vision.

“Easy for you to say!” Margaret snapped. “With what money?”

Evelyn’s head jerked up. “The Blackwoods paid you a fortune! Why not use that?”

Margaret’s lips curled. “Debts, Evelyn. Your father owed millions. Don’t look at me like I stole from you. Besides, his illness is terminal. Death is a mercy.”

With that, she stormed out.

Evelyn stayed.

Flawed as he was, Richard was still her father. The man who’d once carried her on his shoulders.

“Don’t blame her, Dad. Money’s tight,” Evelyn whispered, tears falling. “Just… hold on, please.”

Richard didn’t respond.

Instead, his tear-filled eyes locked onto hers. His lips trembled. “Evelyn… my girl… I failed you… failed your mother… Next life… I’ll make it right…”

His hand went limp.

A scream tore through the house.

Evelyn’s world shattered.

———

The funeral was a bleak, rain-soaked affair.

Few attended—the Thornes had fallen far.

After the service, Margaret left with the guests.

Soon, only Evelyn and Clara remained, standing before the grave beneath weeping skies.

“Did you hate him, Mom?” Evelyn asked, staring at the headstone.

Clara’s voice was hollow. “Yes. Even now, I can’t forgive him.”

“Then why cry?”

“Because I loved him too.” Clara sighed. “Love and hate aren’t opposites, Evelyn. They’re twins.”

———

That night, Evelyn dragged herself back to Dominic’s mansion.

Three days had passed since her father’s death. Three days without contact from the Blackwoods.

She hadn’t told them.

What was the point? Her marriage was a glacier.

As she stepped into the courtyard, laughter spilled from the lit windows. A party was in full swing.

Guests in glittering attire clinked glasses in the grand hall.

“Madam!” Mrs. Wilkins hurried over, then faltered at Evelyn’s hollow expression.

“You’re soaked. Come inside.”

Evelyn’s black trench coat clung to her, revealing pale legs and damp leather flats.

She changed into plush slippers, then scanned the room.

The guests stared—some curious, others disdainful.

Dominic lounged at the center, a cigarette between his fingers, wreathed in smoke.

And beside him—

A stunning woman in a white dress, her curves pressed against him, sharing his cigarette.

Their intimacy was unmistakable.

The woman noticed Evelyn’s gaze and smirked. “You must be Evelyn Thorne. Dominic’s… wife.” She emphasized the word like a joke. “Rosalie had good taste. You’re pretty. Just… small.” Her eyes raked over Evelyn’s frame. “In all the wrong places.”

Evelyn’s lips thinned. “You’re perfect. When’s the wedding?”

The woman’s smile vanished. “You little— Do you know who I am? If I slapped you right now, Dominic wouldn’t even care!”

Her hand rose—

CRASH.

Evelyn smashed a champagne bottle against the table.

Shards flew. Liquid pooled like blood.

She pointed the jagged edge at the woman, eyes blazing. “Try it. I dare you.”

The room froze.

This wasn’t the meek Evelyn they’d heard about.

Through the haze of smoke, Dominic’s gaze burned into her—equal parts fury and fascination.
###Chapter 10

The mansion's grand living room plunged into such profound silence that Evelyn could hear her own pulse throbbing in her ears.

Evelyn stormed upstairs, slamming her bedroom door with such force that the walls trembled.

The violent impact echoed through the entire Blackwood estate.

No one dared make such noise in Dominic Blackwood's presence - it was practically a death wish.

All eyes darted to Dominic, anticipating his reaction. Yet the billionaire remained impassive, his expression unreadable.

Normally, any sound exceeding conversational volume would earn his immediate displeasure.

Evelyn's door slam had shattered that threshold spectacularly. So why wasn't he furious?

More perplexing - she'd just destroyed a $30,000 bottle of Dom Pérignon without hesitation.

"Christ, I heard Miss Thorne's father died recently," someone finally whispered. "She's wearing black - probably just back from the funeral!"

The speaker was Bianca Chamberlain, Sterling Group's PR director.

Tonight was her birthday celebration, coinciding with Dominic's recovery from illness.

Her earlier confrontation with Evelyn had left her pride wounded.

Though Dominic appeared unbothered, Bianca knew his temper could ignite without warning.

She approached him cautiously. "Dominic, I...I didn't know about her father."

Dominic stubbed out his cigarette with deliberate precision. His long fingers curled around the crystal tumbler, draining it in one smooth motion.

"Happy birthday," he murmured, his voice like velvet over steel.

Bianca's cheeks flushed. "Thank you."

His next words froze her blood. "Evelyn Thorne is off-limits." He adjusted his cufflinks with lethal calm. "Even as a Blackwood pet, only I get to discipline her."

Bianca's breath hitched. "But you're divorcing her! She'll be less than a pet then!"

Dominic's gaze turned arctic. "What's mine stays mine until I discard it. No one humiliates her but me."

Mrs. Wilkins entered to clear the shattered glass and stained carpet.

Someone refilled Dominic's drink.

"Don't be harsh, Dom. Bianca meant no harm," Lucas Grant, the CFO, interjected. "She wouldn't actually touch Miss Thorne."

"Exactly!" another executive chimed in. "Bianca, take three shots as penance! Birthday girl or not, you crossed a line!"

As Bianca reached for her glass, Dominic signaled his bodyguard.

"Enjoy your party," he said coolly before exiting.

Bianca watched him leave, eyes glistening, then downed three consecutive shots.

"Damn, both our stars have left. Do we keep drinking?" someone asked.

"Obviously! Maybe this'll cure Bianca's Mrs. Blackwood delusions!"

"Don't count on it. Dominic's still divorcing her."

"Speaking of Evelyn Thorne - stunning but volatile. How does he tolerate it?"

...

In the guest suite, Evelyn curled into herself, silent tears streaking her face.

Three days of composure shattered like the wine bottle downstairs.

Her father's dying apology haunted her.

All her hatred had dissolved, leaving only hollow grief.

She cried herself into exhausted sleep.

Morning brought swollen eyes and throbbing temples.

Changing into fresh loungewear, Evelyn emerged ravenous - she'd barely eaten in days.

She froze in the dining room doorway at the sight of Dominic's broad shoulders.

Mrs. Wilkins brightened. "Breakfast is served, Madam!"

Previously, Evelyn avoided Dominic like the plague, terrified of provoking him.

Now, impending divorce papers lent her courage.

She took the farthest seat. As Mrs. Wilkins served her omelet, Dominic spoke.

"That wine last night cost thirty grand."

His tone was conversational.

Evelyn's fork clinked against her plate.

Thirty thousand dollars? For wine?

Was he expecting reimbursement?

Did she look like she carried that kind of cash?

A cramp twisted her stomach. Cold sweat dampened her back, appetite vanishing.

Dominic studied her pallor. "Consider this a warning. Break anything else here, you'll pay retail."

Her stomach settled instantly, hunger returning.

Unlike most pregnant women suffering morning sickness, Evelyn had been relatively symptom-free.

Until now.

The bacon on her plate triggered sudden nausea. She pushed it away.

"Is the food not to your liking, Madam?" Mrs. Wilkins fretted.

"Just craving vegetarian lately," Evelyn managed.

"Of course, I'll adjust the menu," the housekeeper assured.

After breakfast, Evelyn dressed to meet Richard Thorne's lawyer.

Coincidentally, Dominic was also departing.

With bodyguards and chauffeur at his disposal, he moved with regal efficiency.

Evelyn checked her watch - 9 AM for a 10 AM meeting. The estate's gates were a ten-minute walk.

The post-rain chill bit through her coat.

Then the nausea hit violently.

A silver Bentley exited the estate, slowing as the driver spotted Evelyn.

"Sir, it's Madam Thorne," the driver noted.

Dominic's eyes snapped open.

"She's... vomiting, sir," the driver added awkwardly.

Evelyn clung to a trash bin, heaving. So much for easy pregnancy.

As she turned toward home, the Bentley idled beside her.

Sunlight glinted off polished chrome.

The rear window lowered, revealing Dominic's piercing gaze.

Evelyn's cheeks burned.

Did he suspect?

She straightened. "Breakfast disagreed with me," she lied, meeting his stare.
###Chapter 11

Dominic extended his arm through the car window.

Between his elegant fingers rested a pristine handkerchief.

Evelyn froze. She nearly refused but found herself accepting it against her usual instincts.

"Thank you."

The lingering warmth from his touch remained on the fabric.

Dominic swiftly averted his gaze and rolled up the window as the car accelerated away.

At Thornfield Industries, the morning bustle hummed through the office floors.

A month had passed since employees received their last paycheck. Yet despite circulating rumors of financial ruin, the loyal staff continued working diligently.

Evelyn couldn't reconcile this scene of normalcy with the crushing debt she knew existed.

Vincent Holloway escorted her into the conference room where the lawyer waited.

"My condolences, Miss Thorne," the lawyer began without preamble. "Your father appointed me to execute his will."

Evelyn gave a tight nod.

The lawyer opened a dossier. "Your father owned six properties across prime locations." He slid documents across the table. "Details are all here."

Evelyn examined the papers with growing unease.

"Additionally, there are three parking garages," the lawyer continued, producing more files, "eight commercial storefronts, and twelve luxury vehicles."

The revelations kept coming. Evelyn had never known the extent of her father's wealth.

Why hadn't he liquidated assets for his medical treatment?

"The final asset is this company," the lawyer said, gesturing around them. Then added carefully, "Though currently operating at significant loss."

"How much?" Evelyn's voice barely carried.

Vincent adjusted his glasses. "One hundred twenty-five million. Inheriting means assuming that debt. You'd need to sell everything we just discussed."

Evelyn's breath caught. The sum was astronomical.

"You could refuse," Vincent offered grimly. "But this was your father's life's work. Can you watch it collapse?"

"What about Margaret and Victoria?" Evelyn asked after collecting herself.

Vincent's expression darkened. "Your stepmother's brother embezzled millions before disappearing. They fled the country this morning."

Evelyn pressed her palms to her temples. "I want to save Father's company, but that amount—"

"Secure a loan," Vincent urged. "Our new product is nearly market-ready. With funding, we could recover."

"Who would lend that much?" Evelyn's laugh held no humor.

"Banks. Investors. We must try. Will you?"

At Blackwood Group's executive floor, sunlight streamed through panoramic windows.

Dominic's sharp profile stood in silhouette as he reviewed documents Nathan presented.

"Thornfield Industries owes one hundred twenty-five million, sir. The widow and younger daughter fled overseas this morning. Miss Thorne will likely abandon the company."

Lucas Grant stirred his coffee with fox-like amusement. "I'll wager Evelyn comes to Dominic for the loan. Given their... arrangement."

Nathan shook his head. "She wouldn't dare."

"You didn't see her last night," Lucas chuckled. "Smashed a vintage wine bottle and stood her ground against Bianca. There's steel beneath that soft exterior."

"A month of coffee if I'm wrong," Nathan countered. "You buy for the entire department if you lose."

"Deal."

By afternoon, Evelyn had contacted every major bank.

Reality proved harsher than Vincent's optimism.

Eight calls. Two banks already held company debts. None would extend further credit.

"Here's our product prospectus," Vincent said, handing her a thick binder. "I'll arrange meetings. Dress appropriately."

"Why?" Evelyn frowned at her blouse and slacks.

"First impressions matter in finance," Vincent said pointedly.

At six p.m., Nathan received updates.

"We both lose, Lucas. Miss Thorne secured dinners with River City and Silver Linings Bank tonight."

Lucas groaned. "Those lecherous old bankers? She's throwing herself to wolves! Why not approach Dominic?"

Nathan watched Dominic's expression darken dangerously.

Evelyn remained his legal wife. This would publicly humiliate him.

"Shall I warn her, sir?" Nathan ventured.

Dominic's knuckles whitened around his pen. "Don't interfere."

He needed to see how far she'd go.

Lucas cleared his throat. "Drinks tonight? My treat."

Dominic slammed his laptop shut and wheeled away, his bodyguard following silently.
###Chapter 12

The clock struck nine in the evening.

Crisp autumn leaves danced across the pavement in the chilly breeze.

Evelyn stepped out of the taxi, shivering as the cold night air hit her bare shoulders.

She tightened her grip on her clutch and hurried toward the imposing gates of the Blackwood estate.

The strapless crimson gown she wore shimmered under the moonlight, its daring cut accentuating her curves in a way that was both elegant and provocative.

That morning, she'd left wearing simple jeans and a sweater.

The stark contrast between her daytime and evening attire would undoubtedly fuel Dominic's suspicions.

Dominic sat motionless in the dimly lit parlor when Evelyn entered, his piercing gaze tracking her every move.

His tailored charcoal shirt made his chiseled features appear even more severe, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn hesitated by the foyer, unsure whether to acknowledge his presence after their tense morning encounter.

That tissue packet he'd given her earlier flashed through her mind.

Steeling herself, she approached the living area where Dominic waited like a predator in the shadows.

The house felt eerily quiet without Mrs. Wilkins' usual warm greeting.

"Come here." His command sliced through the silence like a blade.

Evelyn froze mid-step. "What do you want?"

"I said come here." The dangerous edge in his voice sent chills down her spine.

Her pulse quickened as she reluctantly obeyed, drawn toward him despite every instinct screaming to run.

Even confined to his wheelchair, Dominic radiated terrifying authority.

Standing before him, she inhaled sharply. "Is this about finalizing our divorce?"

His jaw tightened at her words.

Then his nostrils flared as he caught the faint scent of alcohol clinging to her hair.

"You've been drinking." His accusation hung heavy between them.

Before she could react, his large hand clamped around her wrist with bruising force.

"Who were you drinking with? Did you enjoy yourself?" His grip tightened with each word.

"Let go! You're hurting me!" Tears welled in her eyes as she struggled against his iron hold.

"Answer me!" he demanded, his fury growing as her pain became evident.

"I don't know what you're talking about!" Her voice broke as hot tears spilled over.

Dominic's gaze darkened. In one swift motion, he pulled her into his lap, his nose brushing against her neck.

Her skin carried only the faintest trace of her floral perfume - no alcohol.

Evelyn held perfectly still, hyperaware of Dominic's warm breath against her collarbone.

Her heart pounded so violently she feared he might hear it.

When he finally lifted his head, confusion flickered in his obsidian eyes.

"Your dress reeks of another man's liquor." His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Shall I remove it for you?"

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

Before she could react, Dominic tore the delicate fabric down the middle with one brutal motion.

She gasped as cold air hit her exposed skin. "Dominic Blackwood, you're insane!"

"Remember your place, Mrs. Blackwood." His icy stare raked over her trembling form.

Clutching the ruined designer gown to her chest, Evelyn fought back tears.

Vincent had arranged this disastrous meeting.

Vincent had insisted on this dress.

The bankers had pushed drinks on her all evening, refusing to take no for an answer.

But she'd left immediately - she was pregnant, after all.

"I don't care about being Mrs. Blackwood! Stop imposing your ridiculous expectations on me!"

She shoved her tangled hair back and stood on shaking legs. "I hate you!"

The words tore from her throat before she could stop them.

Slamming her bedroom door behind her, Evelyn collapsed against it, her entire body trembling.

Meanwhile, Dominic stared at his phone screen, reading Nathan's message:

[Sir, Miss Thorne left the restaurant before dinner began. She had an argument with those bankers.]

A muscle ticked in Dominic's jaw.

Even if she hadn't drunk with them, she never should have gone.

Never should have dressed like that.

Never should have...

A soft knock interrupted Evelyn's shower.

Mrs. Wilkins entered with a tray. "Master Dominic insisted you eat something."

Evelyn eyed the steaming soup warily. "What's his game now?"

"The master's been... unsettled since you retired." Mrs. Wilkins glanced at the ruined dress. "Shall I have this repaired?"

"It was borrowed." Evelyn swallowed hard. "Give him the receipt. I can't afford to replace it."

Mrs. Wilkins nodded. "Rest now. We leave for the Blackwood manor tomorrow - Madam Eleanor is being discharged."
###Chapter 13

The master bathroom's marble tiles gleamed under the soft lighting as the nurse meticulously patted Dominic's damp skin with a plush towel.

Dominic's legs trembled slightly, still too weak to support his full weight without assistance. The nurse, a middle-aged man with gentle hands who'd been caring for him since the accident, steadied him with practiced ease.

"You've developed a bruise on your thigh, Mr. Blackwood," the nurse observed while securing the silk bathrobe around Dominic's broad shoulders. "Let me fetch some arnica cream."

Alone for a moment, Dominic parted the robe to examine the discolored skin.

The truth was, he'd felt every bit of Evelyn's pinch yesterday. He'd simply chosen not to react.

Why did her tear-streaked face keep haunting him?

And that delicate floral scent clinging to her skin - why couldn't he shake the memory of it?

In all his thirty-two years, no woman had ever stirred such conflicting emotions within him.

What madness made him obsess over a woman he'd soon divorce?

Yet if given the chance to relive last night, he'd still tear that damned dress from her body without hesitation.

...

At precisely 7:03 AM, Evelyn tiptoed into the dining room, hoping to avoid another confrontation.

"Madam! You're early today as well!" Mrs. Wilkins chirped, emphasizing the last word.

Evelyn froze when she spotted Dominic already seated at the table.

"I prepared vegetarian ravioli especially for you," Mrs. Wilkins continued, guiding Evelyn to her chair. "You mentioned avoiding meat yesterday."

Evelyn perched stiffly on the edge of her seat, her discomfort palpable enough to fill the entire room.

Dominic didn't glance up, yet he felt the weight of her resentment like a physical force between them.

"We're visiting Mother after breakfast," he stated coolly. "You know what topics to avoid."

"When exactly do you plan to reimburse me for that dress?" Evelyn countered, her voice sharp.

"There's limited cash on hand," Dominic replied, sipping his black coffee. "I can transfer the funds if it's urgent."

"Perfect." Evelyn snatched her phone, displaying her account details with a flourish. "Five thousand dollars."

Dominic's gaze snapped up. "The tag said $4,500."

"Then why ask?" Evelyn retorted, extending her bruised wrist. "The extra covers medical expenses."

Dominic's jaw tightened at the sight of the purple marks his fingers had left. He transferred the $4,500 without further comment.

The notification chime soothed a fraction of Evelyn's fury.

"Don't think this settles anything," she hissed. "I wouldn't forgive you for twice this amount."

Dominic responded by silently wheeling himself away, extinguishing another portion of her anger with his indifference.

...

By 9 AM, the Blackwood family assembled in the grand sitting room of the ancestral estate, gathered around the recently discharged Eleanor.

This hospital stay had been more serious than Eleanor's usual hypertension episodes - the ICU admission spoke volumes.

"How are you feeling, Dominic?" Eleanor asked, her frail hand patting his.

"Well enough," he replied, swallowing the harsh words he'd prepared.

Eleanor turned to Evelyn. "And you, dear? Is my son treating you properly?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "He's... adequate. You should focus on your recovery."

"Dominic's never pursued women before," Eleanor said conspiratorially. "He lacks romantic finesse, but his career must come first. You understand, don't you?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her tea. Never pursued women? Had Eleanor met her own son?

"Evelyn," Eleanor continued, "I heard about Thornfield Industries' troubles. Our lawyers confirm the debts won't affect you. Just stay married to Dominic."

Evelyn's grip tightened around her cup. "My father wouldn't want his life's work destroyed. I'll save it myself."

"Oh please!" Beatrice Thorne sneered. "Your father barely spent on you when the company flourished. Why cling to a sinking ship now? Hoping Dominic will bail you out?"

Gregory Blackwood chimed in, "125 million is no small sum. Who'd lend that to you besides our family?"

Heat rose in Evelyn's cheeks. "You overestimate my influence. Dominic wouldn't give me a penny if I begged."

The collective sigh of relief from the Blackwoods was almost comical.

Eleanor grasped Evelyn's hand. "There is a way... Give Dominic an heir, and he'll help you."

Evelyn's free hand drifted to her abdomen as she shot Dominic a sidelong glance.

He sipped his tea, the picture of detached calm.

...

The return car ride was suffocating in its silence, both occupants lost in thought.

Then Dominic spoke, his voice like winter frost:

"If you ever carried my child, I'd remove it myself."

Evelyn's blood turned to ice. Her lips parted, but no words came.
###Chapter 14

In Evelyn's eyes, Dominic's face had transformed into that of a predator, his gaze sharp enough to pierce through her.

"Why?" she demanded, her voice laced with bitterness. "Even if you don't want children, there's no need to be so cruel!"

Dominic's dark eyes were icy as he replied, "Would you have taken the risk if I hadn't made myself clear?"

Evelyn inhaled sharply and looked away.

Fear coiled in her stomach, the sensation like teetering on the edge of an abyss.

Her reaction only deepened Dominic's suspicion.

A mocking smirk curled his lips. "Don’t tell me you were actually considering it?"

Evelyn glared at him.

"Take my warning seriously," he said, his voice dangerously low. "You know what I’m capable of. My actions will be far worse than my words. Don’t test me if you value your life." He turned his gaze to the window.

Clenching her fists, Evelyn snapped, "Relax. I would never have your children. You know how much I despise you. The only thing I want is a divorce—as soon as possible!"

These babies weren’t just his.

If she carried them to term, it would be for herself.

And when they were old enough, she’d tell them their father was dead.

"Not now," Dominic said, his tone calmer. "We’ll discuss it once my mother recovers."

Perhaps her words had struck a nerve.

Maybe he finally understood—he wasn’t the man she wanted.

"Don’t drag this out too long," Evelyn warned.

She bit her lip, anxiety gnawing at her.

If they delayed, her pregnancy would start showing.

And once Dominic found out, he’d force her to terminate it.

"You’re in a hurry to end this," Dominic observed, his cold eyes dissecting her. "Is there something urgent you’re hiding?"

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered.

"No! Nothing urgent. I just—I just can’t stand being with you. Has anyone ever told you how suffocating you are?"

"They wouldn’t dare," he replied dryly.

Evelyn scoffed. "No wonder you don’t like me. But I won’t hold back what I think."

Dominic studied her, as if trying to decipher her meaning.

"No man would tolerate his wife dressing like that and entertaining other men."

"A slip dress makes me a prostitute? Networking is 'entertaining'? What about when you do it?" Evelyn shot back. "Even if you held a knife to my throat, I’d still say I did nothing wrong."

They were from different worlds.

The only thing they shared was being human—everything else was a chasm.

"Are you saying you’d do it again?" Dominic asked, his smirk turning sinister.

Evelyn instinctively pressed herself into the corner of the car.

"I don’t even drink. I’d never risk it."

She would never endanger the lives inside her.

Even if Thornfield Industries collapsed, she wouldn’t sell herself for money.

Her answer seemed to extinguish the fire in Dominic’s eyes.

The car pulled up to the Blackwood mansion.

Evelyn bolted out the second it stopped, as if fleeing.

Dominic watched her retreating figure before ordering the driver, "To the office."

Evelyn exhaled in relief as the car disappeared.

After a brief nap, she arrived at Thornfield Industries by mid-afternoon.

She needed to liquidate some of her father’s assets to pay off debts.

She’d handle what she could before seeking investors.

The banks were no longer an option.

After last night, she’d burned bridges with Ravenswood Bank and Silvercrest Trust. Both managers had made it clear—no loans for her.

"Don’t blame yourself, Evelyn," Vincent said with a frown. "If you’d drunk with them, they might have crossed the line. I’d never ask you to do that."

Evelyn nodded. "I wouldn’t have done it even if you did."

Vincent’s cheeks flushed slightly as he handed her a list.

"I compiled this last night—potential investors in Ravenswood with the capital to save us. You just need to convince one."

Evelyn scanned the names, companies, net worths, and contact details.

Some had numbers. Others didn’t.

"How do I reach the ones without contacts?" she asked.

"Those are the elusive ones. We’ll have to approach them at their offices," Vincent explained.

Evelyn’s eyes snagged on the second name:

Dominic Blackwood. Male. Blackwood Group. Net worth: 15+ billion.

Contact: None.

Her face heated. "Dominic is worth that much?"

She grabbed a glass of water to hide her unease.

"That’s a conservative estimate," Vincent said. "He founded Blackwood Group during the internet boom. His real worth is likely much higher."

"I see…"

"Too bad I couldn’t get his number. We’ll have to go to Blackwood Group. I’ll come with you."

Evelyn shook her head violently. "No. I won’t meet him."

She picked up a pen and crossed his name off the list.

He’d never lend her the money. Asking would only invite humiliation.

On her way home, Evelyn stopped at a pharmacy.

She needed something for her bruise.

After the pharmacist recommended a few ointments, Evelyn hesitated.

"Are these safe for pregnancy?"

The pharmacist’s eyes widened. "You’re pregnant?"

Evelyn nodded silently.

The pharmacist immediately swapped the products for a bottle of pills.

"How far along? Since you’re not showing yet, now’s the perfect time for calcium. This one’s highly recommended—absorbs well."

Evelyn left with the supplements.

When she returned home, Mrs. Wilkins had kept dinner warm for her.

"What’s in the bag, Madam?" the housekeeper asked, spotting the pharmacy logo.

Evelyn hid it behind her back. "Just something for the bruise."

"We have plenty of medical supplies here. Just ask next time," Mrs. Wilkins said kindly.

Evelyn forced a smile. "I’ll remember. I’m going upstairs."

She turned—and collided with Dominic.

He’d arrived unnoticed during their conversation.

His sharp eyes locked onto the bag she’d tried to conceal.

"Why did you lie?" he asked, his voice dangerously soft.
###Chapter 15

The prenatal vitamins were the same standard formulation used by seniors and osteoporosis patients, the label clearly marked "Calcium + Vitamin D Supplement."

"Must you announce your medication to the world?" Evelyn snapped.

Her cheeks burned crimson, though her voice remained steady.

She fled the scene immediately after speaking.

After locking the pills in her nightstand drawer, she retreated to the bathroom to splash cold water on her face.

This couldn't continue. Every passing day increased the risk of exposure.

All her medical records lay vulnerable in that room. One curious glance from Dominic would unravel everything.

Logically, she knew Dominic could be intense but wasn't deranged enough to rifle through her personal belongings.

Besides, without his initiative, divorce remained impossible.

The Blackwoods' extravagant dowry had shackled her family in golden chains.

Perched on the bed's edge, Evelyn's whirling thoughts made her forget her gnawing hunger.

A gentle knock interrupted her spiraling anxiety.

"Mr. Blackwood has retired to his quarters, Mrs. Blackwood. You should eat something," Mrs. Wilkins' kind voice called through the door.

Evelyn exhaled in relief. Everyone at Mooncrest Manor treated her with kindness - everyone except its master.

Perhaps they pitied her youth.

The dining table groaned under an elaborate spread when she arrived with the housekeeper.

"This is too much for one person, Mrs. Wilkins. Won't you join me?"

The older woman smiled indulgently. "Eat what you can, dear. Household rules prevent me from dining with you."

"I see..." Evelyn hesitated before asking, "Do you have children?"

With Dominic absent, her shoulders relaxed visibly.

"Two at Ravenswood University - about your age. Why do you ask?"

A faint blush colored Evelyn's cheeks. "Just making conversation... They say pregnancy changes your figure permanently, but you look marvelous."

"I had terrible morning sickness. Never weighed more than 110 pounds during pregnancy, so my shape barely changed."

"Was your bump very noticeable then?"

"Hardly! At eight months, people mistook me for five months along. Loose dresses made me look merely plump."

Inspiration struck Evelyn like lightning.

She abandoned her fork after three bites.

Controlling her portions might conceal her condition longer.

"You've barely touched your food," Mrs. Wilkins fretted.

"Not very hungry," Evelyn lied. "Please don't prepare so much for dinner. I'm watching my weight."

"But you're skin and bones!"

"I detest exercise. Portion control's easier."

Back in her room, Evelyn retrieved the latest ultrasound report.

The doctor had circled her next appointment - tomorrow, when she'd be twelve weeks along.

She collapsed onto the bed, hands cradling her still-flat abdomen. No flutter of life answered her touch.

Morning sickness had been merciful, but her changed appetite left her thinner than before.

Dawn found Evelyn at St. Elizabeth Medical Center for her battery of tests.

By noon, she emerged starving, several results pending until afternoon.

A tap on her shoulder startled her mid-step.

Bianca Chamberlain stood there, pristine in a white sheath dress and Chanel blazer, her sleek ponytail swinging.

"Fancy meeting you here. Unwell?" The PR director's smile didn't reach her eyes.

"Routine checkup." Evelyn tried sidestepping, but Bianca blocked her path.

"Let me make amends for last time. My treat for lunch?"

"Not necessary."

Bianca's expression turned wounded. "Just a friendly chat. No ulterior motives."

The performance made refusal seem churlish.

Hunger weakened Evelyn's resolve. Fasting for bloodwork left her dizzy.

They settled at a nearby bistro.

Evelyn ordered steamed vegetables.

Bianca selected two salads before dismissing the waiter. "Carbs after noon? Never."

Then came the interrogation masked as small talk. "Eleanor adores you, doesn't she? Such a shame Dominic can't divorce you."

"Why didn't you volunteer when Eleanor sought brides?" Evelyn countered.

Bianca's laugh sounded brittle. "I was vacationing in Milan. By my return, you'd already said 'I do.'"

"How... unfortunate for you."

Bianca's manicured fingers tightened around her water glass. "Doubt my devotion? I had a hysterectomy for Dominic. Would you?"

Evelyn's fork clattered against her plate.

"I'm incomplete now, but regret nothing." Bianca lifted her chin proudly, awaiting admiration for her sacrifice.

"Dominic's madness manifests in hurting others. Yours makes you self-destruct. Both are equally tragic," Evelyn said quietly.

Bianca's mask slipped. "You know nothing! I'm the only woman he tolerates—"

"There's someone else," Evelyn blurted, then instantly regretted it.

Bianca froze before erupting in shrill laughter. "Liar! He barely endures you!"

"Not me. Another woman." The words tasted bitter.

"Impossible!" Bianca's voice turned shrill. "I've known him a decade, my brother twenty years! No other woman exists!"

Evelyn's certainty wavered.

If Bianca spoke truth... then what had she seen on Dominic's computer that night?
###Chapter 16

"Who told you Dominic has someone he likes? Where did you hear that? Do you know her name?"

Bianca's confident demeanor wavered slightly, though she had been certain that no other woman existed in Dominic's life besides her.

Evelyn shook her head. "It was just speculation... I don't know him as well as you do."

She caught herself, realizing she had spoken too freely.

The situation was more complicated than she had initially thought, and she had no intention of getting entangled in it.

All she wanted was to safely deliver her babies and live a quiet life.

"You scared me! I thought you'd actually seen him with another woman!"

Bianca exhaled in relief after Evelyn's clarification.

"Dominic isn't the type of man you assume he is. He despises women and children."

"Do you know why he dislikes children?" Evelyn asked casually.

"Honestly, I have no idea. And I don’t care to find out. If he doesn’t want them, then I won’t have them," Bianca said, then frowned slightly, murmuring to herself, "Though he’s always been kind to me."

"As long as you're happy."

Evelyn gave up trying to reason with her.

Everyone had the right to make their own choices—what mattered was being prepared to face the consequences.

She thought Bianca was foolish, but then again, others might see her own decision to carry Dominic’s children as equally irrational.

When their food arrived, Evelyn ate hungrily, her appetite unaffected by the conversation.

Bianca, however, barely touched her plate, lost in thought.

"Are you absolutely sure you haven’t fallen for Dominic?" she pressed.

"Completely sure," Evelyn answered without hesitation.

Bianca studied her, perplexed.

"Why not? He’s powerful, wealthy, and undeniably attractive."

Evelyn met her gaze. "If I had to choose between you and him, I’d choose you."

At least that way, she wouldn’t get hurt.

Bianca blinked, stunned.

"Why?! Are you—"

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "It was just an example. The point is, I have no interest in him."

Bianca’s defenses crumbled, and she found herself softening toward Evelyn.

She remembered how Evelyn had been the only one in her family to fight for Thornfield Industries after her father’s death. A pang of sympathy struck her.

"You’re still in college, aren’t you?" Bianca asked.

Evelyn sipped her water. "Graduating next year."

"Ah. About your father’s company… His debts aren’t your responsibility. You should focus on finishing school and moving forward," Bianca advised. "How could you possibly repay that much? Don’t destroy yourself over it."

Evelyn lowered her eyes, silent.

Everyone around her urged her to abandon Thornfield Industries.

One hundred and twenty-five million dollars was an impossible sum.

Even her own mother had told her to walk away.

But Vincent kept insisting their new product was revolutionary—that if they could just push through, everything would turn around.

The conflict gnawed at her relentlessly.

Bianca paid for lunch when they finished.

Since they’d mostly ordered salads, the bill was modest, so Evelyn didn’t protest.

"Give me your number," Bianca said as they stepped outside.

"What for?" Evelyn replied. "Once the divorce is finalized, there’ll be no reason for us to see each other again."

Bianca stiffened at the rejection, but the thought of never encountering Evelyn again soothed her irritation.

"True. Once that happens, I’ll be the only one by Dominic’s side," she said, shooting Evelyn a triumphant look before striding away.

——

At 2:30 p.m., Evelyn met with her doctor after receiving her test results.

The doctor adjusted her glasses, scanning the reports. "Everything looks good. But it seems you’re carrying fraternal twins!"

Evelyn froze.

"Still considering termination?" the doctor teased. "The odds of conceiving fraternal twins are like winning the lottery. You’ve hit the jackpot!"

Evelyn’s heart pounded wildly.

Fraternal twins.

She’d heard of them but had never met any in person.

"If you do proceed with an abortion, the sooner the better. The risks increase with time—for you and the babies. Right now, they’re already forming inside you," the doctor said gently.

"I’m keeping them," Evelyn declared.

Her mind was made up.

"Excellent. Fill out these forms, and I’ll set up your file."

——

By 4 p.m., Evelyn stepped out of the hospital, exhaustion weighing on her.

The lack of sleep and early start left her vision blurry, the world around her fading in and out of focus.

She hailed a cab, returned home, and collapsed onto her bed, sinking into a deep sleep.

When she woke, dusk had settled.

She sat up slowly, her mind blank, her stomach hollow with hunger.

Her phone buzzed. She answered.

"Evelyn, did you contact the investors I listed?" Vincent’s voice crackled through the line.

She exhaled. "Not yet. I’ll do it tomorrow."

"Tomorrow’s the weekend! You can’t bother them then. Call them now," he urged.

"Fine."

"Do you need me to resend the list?"

"No, I have it."

"Good. Be persuasive—"

"I know what to say. I need to eat first."

"Right. Where are you staying now that your house was repossessed?"

Evelyn glanced around the guest room. "I rented a place. Don’t worry about me."

"Alright. I’m counting on you."

Dinner tasted like ash.

Back in her room, she dialed each number on the list.

Every single one rejected her before she could finish speaking.

Twenty minutes.

That was all it took for her hopes to shatter.

No one wanted to hear about Thornfield Industries’ new product.

Defeat settled heavily in her chest.

Should she give up?

If she did, Thornfield Industries would be lost forever.

If she didn’t—what else could she possibly do?

The walls of the room seemed to close in.

Evelyn grabbed a cardigan and stepped outside.

The house was silent, the living room empty.

She wrapped the cardigan tighter around herself and wandered into the night.

The wind tugged at her hair, cold biting through her clothes.

She walked aimlessly, memories flooding her mind.

To the world, she had been the untouchable heiress of Thornfield Industries.

No one knew about the lonely meals, the nights spent sick and alone.

A sleek black sedan rolled into the neighborhood.

It slowed to a stop.

Dominic’s eyes opened.

Through the window, he saw a woman crouched under a streetlamp, arms wrapped tightly around her knees.

Evelyn’s shoulders shook with silent sobs.
###Chapter 17

The sleek black car whizzed past Evelyn, kicking up a swirl of autumn leaves in its wake.

She blinked away tears and caught the fading red glow of the Bentley's taillights disappearing into the night.

Was that Dominic's car?

Wiping her damp cheeks, she steadied her breathing before turning toward the mansion.

The familiar vehicle sat parked in the circular driveway when she arrived.

Evelyn lingered by the gatehouse, hoping to enter after Dominic had retired to his quarters.

Her eyes burned. Tilting her head back, she gazed at the constellations twinkling against the velvet sky.

A perfect October evening.

Before she realized, an hour had slipped by unnoticed.

The chauffeur had already stored the car in the underground garage.

Golden light spilled from the living room windows, but no shadows moved within.

Feeling sufficiently composed, Evelyn finally stepped inside.

On the second-floor balcony, Dominic sat motionless in his wheelchair, clad in a charcoal gray robe. The crystal wine glass in his hand held only crimson droplets.

He had observed Evelyn's entire vigil in the chilly night air.

What thoughts could possibly keep a woman standing motionless for sixty minutes in the cold? She'd been so still, the birch trees might have mistaken her for one of their own.

Dominic had surrounded himself with brilliant minds his entire life - the only company worthy of his time.

Yet Evelyn defied categorization.

By any measure, she was foolish to provoke a man like him.

An absolute idiot.

Yet seeing her distress stirred something unfamiliar within him.

An emotion he couldn't name.

......

Perhaps from the night air, Evelyn's head throbbed as she reached her bedroom.

She pulled a cashmere throw from the armoire, cocooned herself in its warmth, and fell into exhausted sleep.

Feverish dreams left her sheets damp by morning, but the night's chill had dissipated.

When dawn came, aside from slight stickiness, Evelyn felt surprisingly refreshed.

After a steaming shower and fresh clothes, she descended to breakfast.

The aroma of bacon led her to the dining room where Mrs. Wilkins immediately served her plate.

"Has he eaten?" Evelyn asked.

"No, Mr. Blackwood hasn't come down yet."

Evelyn grabbed a croissant and orange juice, consuming them in record time.

"Finished in under three minutes," Mrs. Wilkins noted with amusement. "Still afraid of him, Miss Evelyn?"

"Not afraid...just prefer not to see him," Evelyn lifted her chin. "His presence makes me uneasy."

"You'll adjust with time," Mrs. Wilkins said. "Will you be home for lunch?"

"No. Campus obligations today. I'll take dinner at the university too."

"Very well. I'll have Thomas bring the car around."

Evelyn stopped her. "A taxi's fine. Let Dominic keep the driver."

"We have two chauffeurs, dear. One for Mr. Blackwood, one for household use."

Evelyn surrendered to the older woman's insistence.

At Ravenswood University, Evelyn turned to the driver. "Thank you, Thomas. You may return. I'll find my own way home."

As the car pulled away, a familiar voice called out. "Evelyn! Who was that handsome driver?"

Sophie Mercer, her closest friend, appeared unexpectedly at the gates.

"Handsome? That's Mr. Blackwood's employee," Evelyn linked arms with her. "Sophie...I don't think I can join you for grad school."

Sophie froze. "Because of your father? I heard what happened. I'm so sorry."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Truthfully, grad school was never my plan."

"You wanted to marry after graduation, right?" Sophie nudged her. "When do I meet this mystery man?"

Evelyn stiffened.

Only her mother knew about Julian.

To friends, she'd only mentioned dating someone anonymously.

"We're through," Evelyn inhaled sharply. "Have you ever trusted someone completely, only to discover they're human garbage?"

Sophie hugged her as tears threatened. "We're young, Ev. Consider it tuition for adulthood. Better men exist!"

"I'd rather depend on myself," Evelyn chuckled bitterly.

"Heartbreak builds character," Sophie sighed. "Last semester you were lovesick. Look at you now - a proper grownup!"

Evelyn shook her head. "I just hope to support myself after graduation."

"With your double majors and top marks? The world's yours!" Sophie beamed.

Evelyn's cheeks warmed at the praise.

At five p.m., the friends parted at the university gates, dinner plans made.

Sophie suddenly pointed. "Evelyn! Isn't that your driver from this morning?"

The Bentley idled curbside.

Evelyn met the chauffeur's gaze through the open window.

Confusion wrinkled her brow. Hadn't she dismissed him?

What now?

Approaching the vehicle, the driver opened the rear door.

"Trouble?" Evelyn whispered.

With Sophie watching, the man spoke carefully. "Best discuss inside."

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

"Go handle your business!" Sophie waved. "Rain check?"

"Next time's on me," Evelyn promised before sliding into the leather seat.

The car accelerated smoothly.

"Did you upset Mr. Blackwood again?" The driver's knuckles whitened on the wheel.

Evelyn frowned. "I haven't seen him. Did he order this pickup?"

"Yes. Brace yourself."

Evelyn's pulse raced as she mentally retraced her steps.

Impossible!

She'd been on campus all day. No possible offense given.

Nothing from recent days explained this summons.

A headache blossomed from the futile mental gymnastics.

They arrived at Mooncrest Manor at 5:40 p.m.

Evelyn stepped inside, exchanging heels for slippers.

Dominic waited alone in the great room.

His emerald shirt sleeves were rolled to reveal corded forearms.

Diamond cufflinks caught the light.

Lounging with regal indifference, he exuded the dangerous magnetism of a predator at rest.
###Chapter 18

"Take a seat."

Dominic's voice was ice-cold as he glared at Evelyn.

"Fine," she muttered, sinking onto the couch across from him.

A sleek laptop sat on the coffee table between them, its screen angled toward her.

Surveillance footage played on the display.

The video showed a bedroom—their bedroom—with Evelyn perched on the edge of the bed beside Dominic’s unconscious form.

Her blood turned to fire.

She shot to her feet, jabbing a finger at the screen. "Are you serious? You had cameras in the bedroom? What kind of creep does that?"

Rage coiled tight in her chest.

Those three months were supposed to be forgotten.

He had been in a coma—just a body, not a man.

People did things in private they’d never do in public.

And now he had proof of every single one of those moments.

Nobody had warned her about cameras.

Dominic watched her trembling with something close to satisfaction.

"Who said I installed them?"

His mother had.

While he lay helpless, she’d rigged the room with surveillance—protection against potential abuse.

Even a man like him was vulnerable when unconscious.

He couldn’t fault her for it.

But he could fault Evelyn for what she’d done.

He’d reviewed the footage earlier.

And it had sent his blood pressure skyrocketing.

"Oh." Evelyn’s fury flickered, but only for a second. "Your mother? She couldn’t have told me? I—I—"

"You never thought I’d wake up, did you?" His voice was a razor’s edge. "You had fun with me while I was out."

Her face burned as she collapsed back onto the couch.

"That’s not what happened! I was giving you physical therapy! To prevent muscle atrophy!"

She’d watched the nurses do it.

Then taken over, because sitting there doing nothing felt wrong.

For a second, her defiance almost made him doubt himself.

Almost.

"Open it," he ordered. "See for yourself."

Her fingers shook as she tapped the play button.

She knew what was coming.

But admitting she’d messed with him? Never.

She’d just… touched him. A little.

If she’d known he’d wake up—if she’d known about the cameras—she’d have chopped off her own hands first.

She turned her head away, but the footage played in her periphery anyway.

Dominic hadn’t lied.

The video was damning.

Evelyn sucked in a sharp breath. "Okay, listen. The doctors said you were basically dead. I didn’t think you’d wake up! And I was helping you! You can’t ignore all the actual therapy just because I—"

Dominic pinched the bridge of his nose.

"Let me find a clip where I’m actually massaging you properly—"

Her fingers flew over the touchpad.

A minute later, she slammed the laptop shut and leaped up.

"Shit!" Her face was scarlet. "You—you saw all of it? Everything?"

Panic clawed at her throat.

Dominic didn’t even blink. "Obviously."

"You bastard! Who told you to look? You pervert!"

She’d just spotted a clip of herself naked.

She’d gotten careless, stepping out of the shower without clothes.

Why would she worry? He was comatose.

But the cameras had seen everything.

"You’re the one who walked around naked," he said flatly. "And frankly, aside from being pale enough to blind someone, there’s not much to see."

Her vision went red.

"Excuse me? Who the hell are you to judge my body? Shut your mouth if you’re just going to insult me! I’m deleting this!"

She snatched the laptop and stormed off, slamming her bedroom door behind her.

Outside, the driver exhaled a cloud of smoke, shaking his head.

In all his years, he’d never seen a woman rattle Dominic Blackwood like this.

——

By seven that evening, Evelyn had wiped every last second of footage.

She dropped the laptop back on the coffee table, exhausted.

Hunger gnawed at her, but the thought of facing Dominic again made her stomach twist.

Still, she forced herself into the dining room.

He wasn’t there.

But the air still felt thick with surveillance.

"I had no idea about the cameras, Miss Evelyn," Mrs. Wilkins murmured. "Master Dominic values his privacy more than anyone."

"It’s fine," Evelyn muttered. "I deleted it all."

She picked at her food, appetite gone.

"Was he… in a worse mood than usual earlier?"

Mrs. Wilkins hesitated. "A bit."

Evelyn sighed. "Whatever. It’s not like he can stand up and hit me, right?"

She pushed back from the table, determined to stop caring.

But fate had other plans.

She collided with Dominic the second she stepped out.

He didn’t speak. Didn’t move.

Just stared at her with those dark, fathomless eyes—like he could see every thought in her head.

Her pulse stuttered.

"Move."

The command was low, absolute.

Evelyn sidestepped, cheeks burning as he passed.

She’d thought he was coming to torment her.

But he just… sat down to eat.

She groaned, pressing her palms to her face.

So what if he saw me naked?

She’d seen him naked too.

Plenty of times.
###Chapter 19

The sun was already high in the sky when Evelyn finally stirred from sleep.

It was Sunday, and she had slept in until half past ten—something she hadn’t done once since moving into Dominic’s mansion.

When she stepped out of her room, still wrapped in a loose silk nightgown, her tousled hair cascading over her shoulders, she froze.

The living room was filled with men—Dominic’s guests—all turning to stare at her with sharp, assessing gazes.

Her bare face, free of makeup, burned under their scrutiny.

Dominic’s expression was unreadable, but his jaw tightened slightly.

Her pulse spiked.

Without a word, she spun on her heel and retreated back into the safety of her room.

Before she could shut the door, Mrs. Wilkins intercepted her, gently guiding her toward the dining room instead.

“You must be famished, Miss Evelyn. I checked on you earlier, but you were sleeping so soundly, I didn’t have the heart to wake you.”

Evelyn swallowed. “Who… who are those men?”

“Master Dominic’s associates. They dropped by unexpectedly. Don’t worry—you don’t need to greet them.”

Evelyn exhaled.

Good. She barely acknowledged Dominic himself—why would she bother with his friends?

Still, if she’d known he had company, she would’ve left the house hours ago.

The murmur of voices from the living room carried over, sharp with curiosity.

“Dominic, who’s the girl? A live-in nurse? Or… something else?”

A rough chuckle followed. “Come on, we’re all grown men here. It’s only natural for a man like him to have a pretty young thing around.”

Dominic said nothing, and the room fell silent.

Then, someone changed the subject.

“Speaking of young things—anyone heard about Evelyn Thorne from Thornfield Industries? Richard Thorne’s daughter?”

“Oh, her? She called me last week begging for investors. I hung up before she could finish her pitch.”

“She’s got guts, I’ll give her that. But why take on her father’s mess? That company’s a sinking ship.”

“Youth and recklessness go hand in hand. I looked into their new project—some autonomous driving system. Sounds flashy, but the tech’s unstable. Only a fool would invest.”

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her fork.

She finished breakfast quickly, grabbed her laptop, and escaped to a nearby café to work on her thesis.

Right now, she needed to focus on what she could control—her studies, her future.

At four o’clock, an email notification chimed.

She nearly choked on her coffee when she read it.

The sender? Mr. X.

The message? A genuine interest in Thornfield Industries’ new project—with a promise of investment if their meeting went well.

Evelyn’s mind raced.

Who was this man?

If he was serious, why not arrange a formal meeting at the office?

Skeptical, she typed back:

[Is this some new scam?]

His reply came instantly.

[You have a sharp wit, Miss Thorne. Here’s proof of my sincerity.]

An attachment followed—a screenshot of a bank account.

Her breath hitched.

The balance? Two hundred million dollars.

She blinked, recounting the zeros three times before it sank in.

Her fingers trembled as she typed:

[Impressive Photoshop skills. But really—who keeps that kind of money in a checking account?]

[Still doubtful? Give me your account number. I’ll transfer a deposit as a show of good faith.]

[And let you drain my account? Nice try.]

He didn’t respond.

After a moment’s hesitation, she sent him a receive-only account number—one that couldn’t be compromised.

Within minutes, her phone buzzed.

A notification.

$800,000.00—Deposit Received.

Her heart stopped.

——

Vincent arrived thirty minutes later, breathless.

“Evelyn, tell me this isn’t a joke. Did this guy really just send you eight hundred grand?”

She showed him the transaction.

Vincent’s face lit up. “Who is he? We need to meet him—immediately!”

Evelyn bit her lip. “He sent an address. Wants to meet Friday night.”

“Perfect! Send it to me—I’ll go with you.”

She nodded, but unease prickled down her spine.

Who was Mr. X?

Why her?

And why was he willing to throw money at a failing company without even meeting her first?

——

Friday came too soon.

At breakfast, Dominic set down his coffee. “Dinner at the estate tonight. Be there.”

Evelyn hesitated. “I… have a late seminar. I’ll be back afterward.”

His gaze darkened.

“You’re still my wife,” he said softly. “If I find out you’re lying, there will be consequences.”

Her blood turned to ice.

They’d been civil lately—almost pleasant.

Why the sudden threat?

Before she could ask, he walked away.

She glared at his retreating back. “Jerk.”

——

At 5:40 PM, Evelyn stood outside Twilight Bar, nerves frayed.

Vincent’s call came through, frantic. “Traffic’s a nightmare! Go in without me—I’ll be there ASAP!”

Her stomach twisted.

An attendant led her to Private Room V606.

She inhaled deeply and pushed the door open.

The room was dim, but the silhouette in the wheelchair was unmistakable.

Her breath caught.

Dominic.

Her pulse roared in her ears.

What the hell was he doing here?

Unless…

Unless he was—
###Chapter 20

Evelyn felt like invisible hands were closing around her throat.

The air grew thick as the room began to spin uncontrollably.

How could Dominic possibly be Mr. X?

Mr. X had transferred eight hundred thousand dors and expressed interest in Thornfield Industries. Why would Dominic do such a thing?

Yet if he wasn't Mr. X, what was he doing in this private room?

Her thoughts raced as she studied the man before her. The wheelchair, the dark shirt, that unnaturally pale complexion - everything confirmed this was Dominic Blackwood.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and instinctively retreated, only to find the door firmly shut behind her.

"Leaving without proper greetings?"

Her visible discomfort made Dominic's lips press into a thin line.

"What brings you to a place like this?"

Evelyn nervously tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, forcing composure. "I... I'm meeting friends for dinner."

"This is a bar."

"Oh..."

Her eyes darted around the lavish private room that suddenly felt like a prison.

"I... must have the wrong room. I should go find them."

"Evelyn Thorne," Dominic's voice cut through the air like ice. "Did my warning this morning mean nothing to you?"

"I heard you," Evelyn countered, "but I don't live by your commands."

The memory of their last confrontation burned fresh in her mind.

She'd been sober that night, yet he'd accused her of dressing provocatively to attract male attention.

Dominic's eyebrows arched at her defiance.

She was unlike other women - fiercely independent, unyielding to authority. Most frustratingly, his threats never seemed to faze her.

Which meant she didn't take him seriously at all.

Dominic lifted his wineglass, taking a deliberate sip.

Evelyn steadied her breathing. "Why are you here? I thought you were dining at the family estate."

She desperately wanted to ask if he was Mr. X, but fear held her tongue.

The possibilities terrified her.

If he was Mr. X, how would they conduct business?

If not, how would she explain her earlier deception?

"Join me for a drink," Dominic commanded, his bloodshot eyes locking onto hers.

Evelyn's brow furrowed.

What game was he playing?

"I don't drink," she stated firmly. His intentions were unreadable, and she needed escape. "Enjoy your evening. I'm leaving!"

The door refused to budge despite her efforts.

Locked from the outside.

"Dominic! Open this door!" Her cheeks flushed with anger.

"I said drink with me," his voice turned dangerous. "Are you deaf or just pretending?"

Cold sweat trickled down Evelyn's spine, her legs trembling.

If only she could drink, she'd humor him to end this nightmare.

But she couldn't.

Not now.

Not even if he threatened her life.

Trapped, she approached him cautiously.

"I lied this morning," Evelyn admitted, avoiding his gaze. "I had a business meeting tonight. Someone agreed to invest in my father's company."

"Who?"

"I don't know his name."

"You'd meet a nameless stranger?"

"Vincent was coming with me."

"Where is he then?"

"Stuck in traffic."

Evelyn met Dominic's stare with watery eyes. "I'm an adult. Even as your wife, I deserve my own life. You have no right to control me."

As she spoke, Dominic took another sip, his throat moving hypnotically.

Would he get drunk?

How would he return home if he did?

Her thoughts scattered as Dominic's hand shot out, gripping her arm painfully.

Before she could react, he flung her onto the plush couch.

Though soft, the impact stung her pride.

Did he see her as some plaything?

Denied even basic autonomy?

Clenching her teeth, she started to rise.

Then froze.

Dominic stood before her - towering, menacing, completely out of his wheelchair.

Her mind blanked.

All anger forgotten.

Words failed her.

In one swift motion, Dominic pinned her down.

"Men bring women here for one reason. If that's not your purpose, why come?"

His fingers gripped her chin painfully, forcing her mouth open.

With his free hand, he lifted the wineglass, its contents sloshing ominously.

Terror seized Evelyn.

Tears streamed as she struggled uselessly beneath his weight.

"You answer a stranger's invitation... You need to learn consequences," Dominic growled, tipping the wine into her mouth.

Evelyn clawed at his arms, but his strength was terrifying for someone recently ill.

The image of him standing flashed through her mind - so much taller than she'd imagined.

The bitter liquid choked her, triggering violent coughs.

She felt herself drowning.

Instinct took over.

In panic, she yanked Dominic's collar, sending a button flying.

Cool air hit his exposed chest.

Seeing her tear-streaked face, something in Dominic shifted.

He released her chin.

Evelyn immediately spat out the wine.

"I hate you, Dominic Blackwood!" she sobbed, fists clenched.

"One drink. Was that so difficult?"

His momentary pity vanished. Fingers moved to her collar, popping buttons to reveal delicate collarbones.

"If not me, another man would be doing this! These are the wages of your lies!"
###Chapter 21

The night stretched endlessly, each minute laced with torment.

When dawn finally broke, Evelyn was completely drained, collapsing into unconsciousness.

Dominic arrived at Blackwood Group headquarters at his usual time - precisely 10:07 AM.

The moment he settled into his office, Lucas barged in without knocking.

"I swung by Twilight last night looking for you, but you'd already vanished. Did you and Evelyn Thorne leave together?" Lucas leaned against the desk with a knowing smirk.

Dominic's eyebrow arched sharply. "Is this really why you're disturbing my morning?"

Lucas chuckled dryly and slapped a thick folder onto the polished mahogany surface.

"Thornfield Industries' financial audits from the past five years. Did some digging during my insomnia hours." His expression turned serious. "They're drowning in red ink."

He hesitated before adding, "Their CFO siphoned off nearly half a billion. Rumor has it he was Richard Thorne's brother-in-law."

A muscle twitched in Dominic's jaw.

If Lucas's intel held truth, their failed product launch wasn't the sole reason for Thornfield's impending collapse.

"Lesson learned - choose your spouse wisely," Lucas quipped, shaking his head. "If Richard hadn't cheated on Clara with Margaret all those years ago..."

Dominic's voice turned arctic. "Proof that women are nothing but distractions from success."

"So you're really going through with divorcing Evelyn?" Lucas whistled. "When's the big day? Should I book strippers for your bachelor party?"

Dominic's glare could have frozen lava. "Don't you have spreadsheets to torture? Or has accounting become too mundane for you?"

Lucas sprang up, hands raised in surrender. "Message received. But before I go..." His eyes flicked to Dominic's neck. "Might want to cover up those...cat scratches. Unless you want the whole floor speculating about your wild night."

"Out." The single syllable vibrated with warning.

Lucas practically teleported to the door.

Exactly seventeen minutes later (Dominic had been counting), Bianca rapped on his office door.

"Got a minute?" She entered without waiting for permission, clicking the door shut behind her. "This can't wait."

Dominic didn't look up from his monitor. "Unless it's about the Singapore merger, it can damn well wait."

Bianca marched forward and slammed a manila envelope on his desk. "This is more important than any merger."

She perched on the edge of the visitor's chair, her gaze immediately zeroing in on the telltale marks along his throat. Her manicured nails dug into her palms.

"You slept with her last night, didn't you?" Her voice cracked. "Dominic, she's not worth-"

"Enough." His knuckles whitened around his pen. "My marriage is none of your concern."

With deliberate movements, he opened the envelope and scanned the top document.

MATERNAL HEALTH RECORD
Patient: Evelyn Thorne
Gestation: 12 weeks

Dominic's pulse roared in his ears. The temperature in the room seemed to drop twenty degrees.

His eyes continued down the page.

Father's Name: Julian Whitmore

The file exploded across the room in a shower of paper.

Evelyn was carrying his nephew's child.

###Chapter 22

Bianca Chamberlain saw her chance when she witnessed Dominic Blackwood's barely contained rage.

"Before she became your wife, Evelyn Thorne was involved with your nephew, Julian Whitmore." Bianca's voice dripped with false sympathy. "Everyone has a past, of course. But she continued seeing him after your wedding! They've been laughing behind your back this whole time. I'm certain they were counting on you never waking up from that coma."

Dominic's knuckles turned white as his hands clenched into fists. His sculpted features might as well have been carved from ice, but his eyes burned with barely restrained fury as they locked onto the maternity clinic records spread across his desk.

"This reeks of a calculated scheme to steal your fortune," Bianca continued, carefully measuring each word. "When the doctors declared your condition critical, they saw their opportunity. If Evelyn conceived your child then, she'd control everything. They planned it perfectly - until you miraculously recovered and ruined everything."

"Leave." The single word vibrated with lethal intensity.

Whether Bianca's accusations held truth or not, the mere possibility of this humiliation becoming public knowledge made Dominic's stomach churn with disgust.

Though slightly disappointed, Bianca understood his reaction perfectly. She rose gracefully, pausing only to ensure the door clicked shut with quiet finality behind her.

Dominic's Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard, his breathing ragged. With deliberate movements, he loosened his tie and picked up the damning documents once more.

When his gaze landed on Julian's name listed as the father, something dark and dangerous flickered in his stormy eyes.

He'd always known his brother coveted his empire, but to plant Evelyn as a willing accomplice? The betrayal cut deeper than he cared to admit.

That passionate night with Evelyn now seemed like nothing more than part of their twisted scheme. The realization sent fresh waves of anger coursing through his veins.

Meanwhile, in the master suite of Blackwood Manor, Evelyn slept soundly.

The peace shattered as the bedroom door crashed open with enough force to make the walls tremble.

Before she could fully awaken, rough hands dragged her from the warmth of her bed.

"My apologies, Miss Thorne," the bodyguard muttered without sincerity as he hauled her upright.

"What's happening? Where are you taking me?" Evelyn's voice cracked with sleep and sudden terror.

"To St. Elizabeth Medical Center. For termination."

Those clinical words turned her blood to ice.

How did Dominic discover her pregnancy?

Who betrayed her?

"Where is Dominic? I demand to see him!" Her pleas dissolved into panicked sobs. "I won't do this! You can't make me!"

She struggled weakly against the bodyguard's iron grip, but Dominic had thoroughly exhausted her the previous night. He tossed her into the luxury car's backseat like discarded trash.

Dominic waited inside, his expression colder than she'd ever seen. He flung a crumpled document at her.

"You had countless opportunities to rid yourself of that bastard," he hissed, voice dripping with venom. "Why keep it? Are you truly so devoted to Julian? Shall I demonstrate what happens to those who cross me?"

Evelyn's trembling fingers smoothed the paper - her hospital registration form with Julian's name boldly declaring paternity. She squeezed her eyes shut against the wave of despair.

She'd wanted to list Dominic, but his threats against any potential pregnancy had forced her hand. Now her desperate lie had been uncovered.

"Dominic, please," she begged, clutching his sleeve with desperate fingers. "Don't do this. They're not... they're not illegitimate. They're yours!"

###Chapter 23

Dominic's fingers curled into a fist as he brutally shoved Evelyn's hand away, his voice dripping with venom. "Consider yourself lucky I'm letting you breathe. Another word and I'll make you regret it."

Evelyn's heart shattered at his merciless glare. The pain lodged in her throat, choking her.

There was no reasoning with him. No plea would soften that stone-cold heart. She slumped against the car seat, her hollow gaze fixed on the passing scenery. When the vehicle screeched to a halt outside St. Elizabeth Medical Center, rough hands hauled her out and dragged her toward the OB-GYN ward.

Dominic remained in the car, lighting a cigarette with trembling fingers.

Evelyn's tear-streaked face and the raw hatred in her eyes haunted him.

No. He wouldn't relent.

Betrayal demanded retribution.

The operating room doors hissed shut behind Evelyn.

Thirty agonizing minutes later, they slid open again.

"It's done," the doctor informed the guard. "But she needs observation for another hour."

The guard's mission was complete. With a curt nod, he abandoned the waiting area.

When Clara arrived, she found her daughter curled on a bench, eyes swollen from crying.

"Mom... it hurts so much," Evelyn whispered, her voice breaking.

Clara cradled her close. "Shh, my darling. We're going home. That monster will pay when the truth comes out."

Evelyn gave a broken laugh. "He won't. That man has no heart."

Arm in arm, they staggered toward a taxi.

As their cab disappeared, Dominic's car peeled away from the hospital.

Meanwhile, Julian received a summons to the Blackwood estate.

"Any idea what this is about?" Julian asked Mrs. Wilkins, sipping tea in the parlor. "Uncle Dominic banned me from this house."

The housekeeper wrung her hands. "I-I don't know anything."

She'd hidden in the pantry earlier, powerless as Evelyn was dragged away. The pregnancy revelation had stunned her—but Dominic forcing an abortion? After last night?

Tires crunched on gravel.

Julian sprang up, plastering on a smile as Dominic's wheelchair appeared. The evening sunlight did nothing to soften his uncle's glacial expression.

"Uncle Dominic, what did you want to—"

A boot slammed into Julian's stomach, sending him crashing to the marble floor.

"You've got nerve showing your face here," the bodyguard growled, pressing a shoe against Julian's throat. "Since you're family, pick your poison. How do you want to die?"

Julian's blood turned to ice.

"What did I do? Tell me!" he wheezed.

Dominic leaned forward, lips curling. "I just exterminated your little problem with Evelyn Thorne."

Julian's face drained of color.

"That's impossible! I never touched her! How could she be carrying my child?"

A beat of silence. Then realization dawned.

"Wait... you're saying Evelyn was pregnant?" Julian's voice cracked. "Uncle, if anyone's the father—it's you!"
###Chapter 24

Dominic's brow furrowed deeply.

Had he not witnessed Evelyn completing the list personally, he might have been swayed by Julian's desperate claims.

"The child is yours, Julian!" the bodyguard snapped. "How dare you deny responsibility? Your miserable life wouldn't be enough to atone for this sin!"

Julian whimpered pathetically, "She's lying! Uncle, I broke up with her because she refused to be intimate! She's punishing me by claiming this child is mine! You must believe me - that baby can't possibly be my doing!"

Dominic studied the sniveling man groveling at his feet, a cold disgust settling in his chest.

This was the man Evelyn had loved?

This spineless coward who would betray her without hesitation when cornered?

"Remove him," Dominic commanded, his voice devoid of emotion. "But keep him breathing."

Death would be too merciful.

He wanted Julian to suffer slowly, publicly - where Evelyn could witness every excruciating moment.

Meanwhile, Clara guided Evelyn back to her modest apartment.

Gently, she helped her daughter settle onto the bed.

"Don't cry, darling," Clara murmured, brushing tears from Evelyn's cheeks. "You need rest after... after the procedure."

Evelyn stared blankly at the ceiling. "The baby's still here, Mother. They didn't take my child."

Clara froze. "But you said Dominic forced you to..."

"I told the doctor," Evelyn whispered, her voice chillingly calm, "that if she touched me, neither of us would leave that operating room alive."

Though her child remained safe, something inside Evelyn had shattered beyond repair.

She'd escaped this time - but what about next? The thought haunted her.

As long as she remained under Dominic's control, her baby would never be safe.

The shrill ring of her phone shattered the heavy silence.

The caller ID showed the vice president of Thornfield Industries.

"Evelyn!" His voice crackled with excitement. "Apologies - I was drinking with a potential investor last night and only just woke! Has Mr. X contacted you today?"

Evelyn stiffened. "No. Who were you drinking with?"

"Mr. X - Adrian Vaughn! Can't find anything about him online, but he's young, clearly wealthy. Says he's looking for investment opportunities. I pitched him all night - no idea if he'll bite though."

Evelyn's grip tightened on the phone. "Is he... connected to Dominic Blackwood?"

"Not sure! But he knows Lucas Grant - said Lucas was his senior at university. And since Lucas is CFO of Blackwood Group..."

The vice president's words confirmed her suspicion. Adrian knew Dominic.

"Evelyn, why ask about Dominic? Do you know him?" Curiosity laced his voice.

"No," she lied, the name like acid on her tongue.

Ending the call, Evelyn dropped the phone as if burned.

Clara settled beside her on the bed.

"I found work," Clara announced hesitantly. "Didn't mention it earlier because I wasn't certain I could handle it."

Evelyn pushed aside her anguish. "What kind of work?"
###Chapter 25

"I have an old friend who recently reached out to me," Clara said, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of her sweater. "She's looking for a nanny for her grandchildren. The salary is quite generous - fifteen hundred a month. I thought... well, any job is better than none, so I took it. Today's my third day, and it's been manageable."

She hesitated before adding, "Your father left us with nothing, Evelyn. I can't afford to be picky."

Evelyn felt hot tears spill down her cheeks before she could stop them.

"Your friend must be quite wealthy," she rasped, her throat tightening with emotion. The tears made her voice even rougher. "Working as a nanny for someone you know... that must be humiliating."

Clara shook her head firmly. "Pride doesn't put food on the table, darling. Money comes and goes - who's to say my daughter won't be the wealthy one someday?"

She reached for a tissue and gently dabbed at Evelyn's face.

"Mom, please don't do this," Evelyn sobbed. "I can get a part-time job next semester-"

"And what about now?" Clara interrupted, her brow furrowing. "You're pregnant, Evelyn. If you're determined to keep this baby, we need to be practical." Her expression darkened. "Why would Dominic reject his own child? It makes no sense."

"He's in love with someone else."

Clara's face paled. "Then why didn't he marry her instead?"

"I wish I knew."

"Listen to me," Clara said firmly, pulling Evelyn into a tight embrace. "If it comes to it, we'll hide you until the baby's born. He'll never have to know."

Three days later...

Evelyn's phone buzzed with a call from Julian.

He wanted to meet. After a brief hesitation, she agreed.

There was only one reason he'd reach out - the baby.

At the café, Evelyn couldn't help staring at Julian's battered face. Bandages covered most of his visible skin, but purple bruises peeked through the edges.

"Stop staring," he muttered. "This is your doing. If you hadn't told my uncle the baby was mine..." He sighed heavily. "Consider it my repayment for what I put you through. Though when you asked me to run away with you... I just couldn't."

"Julian Whitmore," Evelyn said coldly, "your real betrayal wasn't refusing to elope. If I hadn't discovered your affair with Victoria myself, were you planning to tell me at all?"

His eyes widened. "How long have you known?"

"That explains why you ghosted me," Evelyn continued, ignoring his question. She took a steadying sip of water. "Where is Victoria now? Her uncle stole from Thornfield Industries. I won't let that slide."

"She's traveling the world," Julian said dismissively. "Going after her for her uncle's crimes is pointless."

"With my father's money, no doubt!"

"Technically, it was her father's money too," Julian countered. When he reached for her hand, she jerked away. "Evelyn, you're misunderstanding my relationship with Victoria. I never loved her. She... seduced me. Men have needs, you know? But you've always been the one I truly-"

"Enough!" Evelyn recoiled, disgusted.

"You don't see the worst of it," Julian continued, gesturing to his injuries. "I'm still hospitalized actually. Came straight here because I had to ask - whose baby is it really?"

"It's gone. Why does it matter now?"

Julian leaned forward, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Here's what I propose - you still have access to him. Find a way to... remove him. Once Dominic's out of the picture, no one can touch us."
###Chapter 26

A Deadly Proposal

Evelyn's brows furrowed. Despite her hatred for Dominic, murder had never crossed her mind.

Even after losing the child she once carried, she couldn't fathom such darkness.

And even if she wanted to—could she actually do it?

Julian studied her hesitation. "My uncle is away on business. Think it over." His voice dropped to a whisper. "Evelyn, if you help me eliminate Dominic, I’ll marry you immediately. Anything you desire, it’s yours. I’ve already spoken to my parents about us. They approve."

His gaze burned with sincerity.

Once, she had longed for his family’s acceptance. Back then, he had refused to acknowledge their relationship.

Now, their approval meant nothing.

"What if I fail?" Evelyn countered. "If he discovers my betrayal, do you think he’d let me live? Julian, you were a coward before, and you still are. If you want him dead, do it yourself. If you can’t stomach the consequences, then don’t stoop to this."

Julian’s face stiffened. He hadn’t expected rejection.

"It won’t fail. Poison. That’s all it takes. You slip it to him, and afterward, there’ll be no traces. My grandmother will handle the fallout, and my father will ensure everything disappears—"

"If it’s so foolproof, why not do it yourself?" Evelyn cut in. "He visits the family estate weekly. You could poison him there."

Julian faltered.

"Honestly, Julian, I don’t think you’ve suffered enough." Evelyn’s voice turned icy. "Dominic is your uncle. How can you plot against your own blood?"

"I see him as family. He doesn’t return the sentiment."

"Because you bribed his lawyer when he was ill, and he found out. That’s why he punished you." Evelyn stood. "I may despise him, but I haven’t lost my sanity."

She turned to leave.

"Evelyn, wait!" Julian grabbed her wrist. "At least stay for lunch. Even if you won’t help me, our family’s feud with Dominic is beyond repair. If I don’t strike first, he’ll crush me eventually."

Something in his tone made her pause.

"You’re serious about poisoning him?" She sat back down.

Julian exhaled. "If you refuse, I’ll find another way. Something quieter. Less detectable."

Evelyn’s eyes narrowed. "When?"

Julian hesitated. "You won’t betray me to him, will you? You wouldn’t want me dead."

"You overestimate my influence. Do you really think Dominic cares what I say?"

"Fine. I haven’t decided yet. He hasn’t returned. We’ll act once he’s back."

After lunch, Julian’s driver collected him.

Evelyn headed to St. Elizabeth Medical Center, where her records had been breached.

The hospital was responsible.

And she intended to find out who had accessed her files.

"Miss Thorne, I didn’t leak your information. No one approached me about it. Perhaps ask someone else?" The doctor who had handled her case dismissed her immediately.

Evelyn’s voice turned steel. "If you don’t help me uncover the truth, I’ll sue you and this hospital. The law will decide. And if it fails me, I’ll take this to the media."

The doctor paled. "There’s no need for threats!"

Evelyn leaned in. "Then give me answers."
###Chapter 27

"It's not your child they're terminating, of course you wouldn't understand my distress!"

The doctor observed Evelyn Thorne's heightened emotions and recognized the gravity of the situation. His tone softened immediately. "Miss Thorne, my deepest apologies. My earlier choice of words was inappropriate. Please, have a seat and calm yourself with some water while I investigate this matter."

After pouring her a glass, the physician hurried to consult his superiors.

Thirty tense minutes later, he returned with unsettling news. "Miss Thorne, are you acquainted with Bianca Chamberlain? She's the individual who accessed your medical records."

The revelation struck like lightning. Without another word, Evelyn stormed out of St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

Who would have imagined Bianca Chamberlain viewed her as such a threat? The woman clearly saw her as vermin needing extermination.

But Evelyn wasn't about to play the victim.

Retribution would come - swift and merciless.

Thornfield Industries

Evelyn entered her father's executive suite where Vincent Holloway had been anxiously awaiting.

"Evelyn, I summoned you for two critical matters," the vice president said, offering her a steaming mug. "Adrian Vaughn has altered his proposal. Initially interested in investment, he now wants to acquire our entire company for one billion."

Evelyn studied Vincent's troubled expression. "That's significantly undervalued, isn't it?"

"In our prime, we wouldn't entertain such an insulting offer," Vincent admitted, adjusting his glasses. "But currently... it's marginally above market value. The greater concern is Vaughn intends to dismantle our core operations. Simply put, he wants to scrap our autonomous vehicle division entirely."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Then why purchase us at all?"

"Our Cerebra System holds immense potential beyond transportation," Vincent explained. "Artificial intelligence applications extend to robotics, drone technology, and more. Your father poured over a billion into its development."

The weight of her inheritance pressed upon Evelyn's shoulders. Her father hadn't left her a failing company - he'd entrusted her with a technological revolution.

Her vision blurred momentarily. Could she possibly fulfill such expectations?

"There's more," Vincent continued, moving toward the bookcase. "Development halted when your father fell ill because he alone possessed the final components." He pressed a concealed button.

The bookshelf slid away, revealing a hidden chamber containing an imposing safe. "We've consulted numerous experts, but none can crack it. Evelyn, did your father ever mention the combination?"

Stepping inside, Evelyn's breath caught. A family portrait dominated the wall - Richard, Clara, and herself, frozen in happier times. The sight brought unexpected tears. Her father had remembered their fractured family after all.

"Listen," Vincent's voice turned conspiratorial, "if we can't salvage Thornfield, let's liquidate the Cerebra System privately. We'd both walk away wealthy. Bankruptcy would be more profitable than Vaughn's paltry offer."

His greedy glint triggered Evelyn's internal alarms. This wasn't business advice - this was treachery.
###Chapter 28

"I have no idea about the password. My father never mentioned it before he died." Evelyn Thorne's brow furrowed as she shook her head.

She wasn't lying.

The truth was Richard Thorne had never disclosed anything about Thornfield Industries prior to his passing, much less revealed his final words regarding the password.

With so many people present in that hospital room, if Richard had spoken the code aloud, she certainly wouldn't have been the only one to know.

"Uncle Vincent, perhaps I should go ask my mother." Evelyn suggested to the vice president, her fingers nervously twisting the hem of her blouse. "She spent more time with Dad during his last moments. She might recall something useful."

Vincent Holloway didn't question her suggestion. "Very well. But remember - this remains strictly confidential. It's Thornfield's best-kept secret. I'm only sharing this with you because you're President Thorne's designated heir."

Evelyn's gaze lingered on the imposing safe, a cold realization dawning in her mind.

They needed her solely because they couldn't crack the safe themselves.

Had they succeeded in opening it without her knowledge, its contents would have vanished long before she ever learned of its existence.

"Of course, I'll keep this absolutely secret." Evelyn assured him while edging toward the exit. "Uncle Vincent, besides you and those technicians, who else knows about this?"

The vice president followed her toward the door. "Just the two senior engineers. They've been with your father since the beginning - his most trusted men. We've agreed to split the proceeds equally when we sell the system. Does that sound fair?"

Evelyn nodded absently. "I'll go consult my mother about the password then."

"Good." Vincent sighed heavily. "Evelyn, you must understand - this isn't betrayal. The board sees us as disposable now that your father's gone. They only want our Cerebra System. Once they have it, we'll be discarded like yesterday's news. This decision pains me deeply."

Evelyn met his troubled gaze. "What if... what if I can't figure out the password?"

Vincent's expression darkened. "Your father wouldn't have left you the company without giving you some clue. Think carefully - any unusual conversations, gifts, anything at all."

"I'll try."

Leaving Thornfield Tower, Evelyn hailed a cab to her mother's modest apartment in Ravenshore's midtown district.

Clara Thorne was chopping vegetables when her daughter arrived. "Evelyn! What did Julian Whitmore want? I thought you two were finished."

Evelyn grabbed a glass of water, taking a long sip before answering. "Dominic Blackwood beat him up. Now Julian wants revenge - tried to manipulate me into harming Dominic."

Clara's knife clattered against the cutting board. "Tell me you didn't agree to that madness!"

"Of course not!" Evelyn scoffed. "What kind of monster do you take me for, Mom?"

Clara exhaled in relief. "You've become so independent lately, keeping things from me. Like your pregnancy... If Dominic hadn't forced that abortion, how long would you have hidden it?"

Evelyn embraced her mother. "I didn't know myself until late. Listen, Mom - do you still have any of Dad's personal effects?"

Clara stiffened. "Evelyn, your father and I divorced years ago. His belongings weren't my responsibility after..." She trailed off. "Why do you ask?"

Evelyn explained the safe situation. "It needs a six-digit code. Any idea what Dad might have used? Did he ever mention anything?"

Clara shook her head slowly. "No passwords. On his deathbed, he just kept apologizing through tears..." Her voice cracked. "I hated him for so long, but seeing him like that... What's the point of holding grudges when someone's gone?"

"Uncle Vincent claims Dad didn't leave me Thornfield just to inherit debts. He says the Cerebra System could be worth millions." Evelyn's nose tingled with unshed tears, the emotional weight pressing down on her.
###Chapter 29

Clara placed her hand gently on Evelyn's shoulder, her voice trembling with emotion. "You're his flesh and blood, sweetheart. He wouldn't dare harm you."

She took a deep breath before continuing. "I stood by him when he built Thornfield Industries from nothing. When we married, I never demanded a single thing." Her fingers tightened slightly. "I poured my entire inheritance into his business. If he lays one finger on you, I'll haunt him from my grave."

Monday morning arrived with crisp autumn air.

Evelyn hailed a cab to Blackwood Group headquarters.

Her first visit to Dominic's corporate empire.

The Blackwood Tower pierced the skyline, its glass façade shimmering like a blade. Evelyn stepped out onto the pavement, smoothing her skirt before entering the cavernous lobby.

"Miss, do you have an appointment?" The receptionist's polished smile didn't reach her eyes.

Evelyn met her gaze steadily. "No. But if you contact Bianca Chamberlain and tell her Evelyn Thorne is here, she'll see me immediately."

The receptionist's eyes flicked over Evelyn's designer handbag before making the call.

Minutes later, the elevator doors parted.

Bianca strode out like a panther spotting prey. Her stilettoes clicked sharply against marble as she approached. "Shouldn't you be recovering in bed?" Her crimson lips curled. "After your... procedure."

Evelyn's minimal makeup couldn't conceal her pallor, but her voice remained steady. "Going through all this trouble, Bianca. Has Dominic actually proposed yet?"

Bianca's laugh tinkled like breaking crystal. "Even if he never marries me, he'll never stay with you." She leaned in, perfume overwhelming. "Letting you terminate was mercy. I'd have made you suffer."

"How very criminal of you."

"Am I supposed to be scared?" Bianca's manicured finger tapped Evelyn's shoulder. "Look at you - pathetic."

Evelyn didn't flinch. "Tell me, Bianca. Have you ever worn a princess-cut dress for Dominic?"

Bianca's perfectly sculpted brow arched. "Don't be absurd. I don't do childish frills."

"Now I understand why he's never wanted you." Evelyn stepped closer, whispering directly into her ear. "Dominic adores the doll-like look. Lace. Petticoats. The whole fantasy."

Bianca's laughter died abruptly.

"I've shared his bed." Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "He prefers pink. And that Japanese hime haircut? Drives him wild."

Bianca's face went sheet-white.

A decade of knowing Dominic, yet he'd never touched her. This girl had known him mere months...

"Wh-why tell me this?" Bianca's voice cracked.

"Because I want my freedom." Evelyn's eyes glittered with cold calculation. "Dress like his fantasy, and maybe he'll finally notice you."

The image flashed in Evelyn's mind - Bianca in that pink confection, styled exactly like the woman in Dominic's secret photos. She wondered if he'd lose control completely. Perhaps his hands would find Bianca's throat instead of her waist this time.
###Chapter 30

Friday Afternoon

"Madam, Master Dominic will be returning tonight. You should come back too!"

Evelyn had been staying at her mother's place ever since Dominic forced her to terminate the pregnancy.

"Fine. It's time to put an end to this." Evelyn hung up and headed straight to Dominic's estate.

Evening fell at seven.

Dominic's private jet touched down at the airport.

He stepped into a sleek black Rolls-Royce, flanked by his security detail.

The moment he settled into the seat, he froze.

Bianca was already inside.

"Dominic, do you like my new look?" She twirled a strand of her freshly cut bob, her pink tulle dress rustling as she leaned closer with a coy smile.

She had planned this surprise carefully.

Dominic's gaze darkened instantly.

The air in the car turned glacial.

Bianca's confidence wavered. Her fingers tightened around the fabric of her dress.

"What's wrong? Don't you like it? Is the dress too much—?" Her voice cracked.

Dominic backhanded her without warning.

The force sent her crashing against the door.

"Scissors." His voice was lethally calm.

His bodyguards outside didn't hesitate—they sprinted to the nearest store.

Bianca trembled, tasting copper on her lips. Her cheek burned.

This wasn't how it was supposed to go.

In ten years, he had never laid a hand on her.

Evelyn Thorne.

This was her doing.

"Dominic, please! Evelyn told me to dress like this! She said it would—"

"Cut it off." Dominic didn't let her finish. "All of it."

The bodyguards returned. They dragged Bianca out, scissors gleaming under the streetlights.

The car door shut.

"Drive."

Evelyn waited in the dimly lit parlor, her suitcase already packed.

Dinner had come and gone.

Now, she just needed to face him.

At eight, headlights cut through the foggy autumn night.

Mrs. Wilkins rushed to greet him.

Evelyn's pulse spiked.

The wheelchair rolled in silently.

Dominic was dressed head to toe in black, his expression unreadable.

"Dominic Blackwood." She steadied her voice. "When are we finalizing the divorce?"

His head tilted slightly.

"Divorce?"
###Chapter 31

"The weekend starts tomorrow. We'll finalize the divorce on Monday!" Evelyn declared, her voice sharp with urgency.

Dominic remained impassive, casually lighting a cigarette while watching her through hooded eyes.

Evelyn's fingers twitched at her sides. Why wasn't he reacting? Was he actually reconsidering the divorce?

The thought sent a chill down her spine.

She drew a shuddering breath. "How can you stand being betrayed like this? If I were you, I'd never want to see my cheating wife again. You have to divorce me! Only a fool would stay married after this!"

Dominic exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his dark gaze tracking her every movement like a predator studying its prey.

"Did you meet Bianca yet? I bet that really got under your skin," Evelyn taunted, desperation making her reckless. "That was all my doing! I orchestrated everything just to torment you!"

From her corner, Mrs. Wilkins clutched her chest. Why was Evelyn sabotaging herself like this? Was the trauma of losing the baby affecting her judgment?

If she kept provoking Dominic like this, there was no telling what the ruthless CEO might do.

Unable to stay silent any longer, the housekeeper stepped forward. "Master Dominic, Madam Evelyn doesn't mean any of this. She's clearly distraught and lashing out. I can personally vouch that she's been home every day since the wedding - there's no way she could have been unfaithful with Mr. Whitmore."

"Mrs. Wilkins, please!" Evelyn's cheeks burned with humiliation. "This is between Dominic and me. I'll handle it."

"Then stop provoking him!" the housekeeper pleaded. "Apologize now while you still can."

"I don't want his forgiveness," Evelyn said through gritted teeth. "I just want my freedom."

Dominic's piercing gaze remained locked on Evelyn's tense shoulders.

Was this some elaborate game to manipulate him? Or did she genuinely want out?

From what he'd witnessed tonight, the latter seemed more likely.

Now that her affair with Julian had been exposed and the pregnancy terminated, she had nothing left to gain from their marriage. No wonder she was so desperate to run back to her lover's arms.

"Dream on," Dominic finally spoke, crushing his cigarette into the crystal ashtray with deliberate force. "You'll remain my wife until the day I die."

"What? Why?" Evelyn staggered back as if physically struck.

His lips curled into a cruel smile. "If staying married tortures you this much, then I'll happily keep you suffering for the rest of your life."

Evelyn's world tilted violently. This wasn't supposed to happen!

He was changing the rules mid-game!

How could she possibly escape him now?

She fled to her bedroom, her mind reeling.

Just as Evelyn slammed her door, Dominic's phone rang.

Lucas's voice came through, strained with worry. "Dominic, Bianca's in bad shape. She's roaming the streets refusing to go home. I can't get through to her."

"Call her brother."

"Already did... Listen, did you confront Evelyn? Was this whole Bianca situation really her idea?" Lucas pressed. "I've never seen Bianca like this before."

Dominic's laugh was ice cold. "Are you seriously blaming Evelyn for Bianca's poor judgment? If Evelyn told her to jump off a bridge, would you blame Evelyn for that too? Use your brain, Lucas."

Though chastened, Lucas couldn't let it go. "You're being unusually lenient with Evelyn. The Dominic I know would've destroyed her for cheating. Forcing an abortion seems... mild for you."

"You think that was easy for her?" Dominic's voice dropped dangerously low.

"Excuse me?"

"Her hatred for me right now is more satisfying than any physical punishment. Watching her powerless to act on that hatred... that's true revenge."

Lucas hesitated. "So you're really not divorcing her? Isn't that dangerous? What if she tries to kill you in your sleep?"

Dominic studied the crushed cigarette in the ashtray, his expression unreadable. "If she manages to kill me..." A slow, dangerous smile spread across his face. "I'll die acknowledging her victory."
###Chapter 32

Evelyn met with Vincent at Thornfield Industries over the weekend.

"We need to open the safe as soon as possible," Vincent said, frustration lacing his voice. "Mr. Vaughn has been pressing for a decision. I don’t know whether to tell him the truth or stall—I have nothing to show him!"

Evelyn nodded, pulling a folded slip of paper from her pocket. "I wrote down some numbers last night. I think my father’s passcode might be a combination of these."

Vincent took the paper, scanning the digits before nodding. "Let’s try them now."

They entered the hidden chamber, approaching the imposing safe. One by one, they input the possible combinations.

Nothing worked.

After the tenth failed attempt, Evelyn exhaled sharply, rubbing her temples. "Would Margaret know the code?" she mused. "The front door at home was set to their birthdays. He trusted her before he got sick."

Vincent scoffed. "If she knew what was inside, she would’ve taken it before she left."

Evelyn bit her lip. "Do you think someone else already emptied it?"

"Impossible," Vincent snapped. "I check the surveillance footage daily. No one but us has been in here."

She sighed. "Then what do we do if we can’t crack it? I can’t think of any other numbers."

Vincent paced, his expression darkening. "There’s one way—force it open. But that risks damaging whatever’s inside."

Evelyn hesitated.

"Give me another day to think," Vincent said. "If we can’t figure it out, we’ll have to take the risk."

She nodded, though unease flickered in her eyes.

"Evelyn," Vincent suddenly asked, suspicion creeping into his tone, "do you know Dominic Blackwood?"

Her pulse jumped. "No," she lied, shaking her head. "If I did, I’d have asked for his help already."

"Really?" Vincent arched a brow. "A friend saw you entering St. Elric District yesterday—where he lives."

Heat rushed to her cheeks. "Oh—that was just a friend. She lives nearby. We had something to discuss."

Vincent smirked. "Didn’t realize you ran in such elite circles."

"She used to be well-off," Evelyn said quickly. "Things changed."

"Right." He didn’t sound convinced. "Well, go ahead and leave. I’ll keep working on this."

"Thank you," she murmured before slipping out.

The moment the door closed behind her, Vincent studied the numbers she’d left behind, his jaw tightening.

How could the heir of Thornfield Industries not know this code?

His suspicion deepened.

Pulling out his phone, he texted Margaret, who called immediately.

"Richard left something behind?" she demanded.

Vincent smirked. "Did you really think he’d leave his daughter with nothing? Turns out you’re just as clueless as I thought."

Margaret’s voice sharpened with greed. "What did he leave her?"

"A safe. Massive. Priceless contents—but no passcode."

Vincent’s tone turned conspiratorial. "Help me crack it, and I’ll cut you in."

"How much?"

"Twenty percent." He chuckled. "Take it or leave it. It was never yours anyway."

Margaret hesitated only a second. "Deal. How many digits?"

"Six. I’ll send you the numbers Evelyn thought were significant—and the failed combinations. See if you can spot a pattern."
###Chapter 33

Vincent stared at the empty safe, his blood boiling.

He had spent the entire day guarding it, convinced Evelyn would slip up and reveal her hand.

If she cracked the code, he could cut her out completely—without paying her a single cent.

Margaret called thirty minutes later, her voice sharp with frustration. "I've run through every possible combination except the ones you've already tried. But listen—the birthdate on Clara Thorne's ID isn't her real one. Let's try the actual date."

"Brilliant!" Vincent replied, his excitement barely contained.

Two hours later, the safe clicked open.

Margaret had been right. Richard hadn’t used the official date—he’d used Clara’s real birthday, combined with Evelyn’s.

The code was a tribute to them.

A perfect match to the hidden family portrait.

Margaret’s face twisted in fury on the video call as the safe swung open.

"That bastard!" she spat. "After all these years together, he still chose them over me! If he weren’t already dead, I’d make him regret it!"

Vincent barely heard her.

His muscles tensed, his pulse racing as he reached inside.

The safe had two layers of security—the code, and then either a key or facial recognition.

The key was right there in the room, its location known only to him and the two technicians.

He turned it, heart pounding, and pulled the door open.

Empty.

Completely empty.

Vincent’s face darkened, his hands clenching into fists.

"Where the hell is it?!"

He slammed his fist against the metal, his vision blurring with rage.

"Evelyn," Margaret hissed through the phone. "It has to be her. She gave you that slip of paper on purpose. She already knew the real birthdate—she must have taken everything!"

Vincent’s jaw tightened. "Did she really think she could steal it all?"

"That little viper!" Margaret sneered. "You can’t let her get away with this, Vincent!"

She wanted them at each other’s throats.

And she’d get her wish.

Vincent ended the call.

Evelyn was trouble.

But so was Margaret.

Neither mattered unless they served his interests.

He kicked the safe shut, his mind racing.

Had Richard moved the contents before he died?

Or had Evelyn taken them after?

Either way, she was his prime suspect.

Did she really think she could take everything and walk away unscathed?

Not if he had anything to say about it.
###Chapter 34

The grand entrance of Ravenswood Manor was bathed in golden light as Evelyn Thorne stepped inside, her heart pounding with uncertainty.

Mrs. Wilkins, the ever-efficient housekeeper, guided her to the plush sofa in the sitting room with an air of urgency.

"Master Dominic has prepared a gift for you, Madam," she announced, gesturing toward an elegant white box resting on the marble coffee table.

Evelyn's fingers hesitated before lifting the lid, revealing a breathtaking ivory gown that shimmered under the chandelier's glow.

"Are you certain this is for me?" she asked, her voice laced with disbelief.

"Indeed, Madam. There's an important dinner tonight, and you're expected to accompany Master Dominic. And look—there are shoes as well!"

Mrs. Wilkins opened a second box, unveiling a pair of exquisite stilettos that looked like they belonged in a designer showcase.

Evelyn picked one up, studying its delicate craftsmanship with wary curiosity.

"Why would he take me? I don’t know his circle. Wouldn’t he be concerned I’d embarrass him?"

The housekeeper offered a knowing smile. "I’m sure he has his reasons. The past is behind you, Madam. Perhaps it’s time to embrace the present."

Evelyn met her gaze, skepticism lingering. "Do you truly believe he’s moved on? We still don’t know what he really wants from me tonight."

A pause. Then Mrs. Wilkins ventured carefully, "Madam… Was the child you lost truly Mr. Julian’s? I never took you for that kind of woman."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the gown’s delicate fabric. "That chapter is closed. Let’s not revisit it."

Without another word, she stood. "I’ll go try this on."

Mrs. Wilkins nodded. "Of course."

That evening, Evelyn arrived at Mooncrest Manor, the grand estate transformed into a dazzling spectacle of wealth and prestige.

Dressed in the ivory gown, she stepped into the banquet hall like a vision—ethereal, untouchable.

The crystal chandeliers cast prismatic light over her, making her appear as if she had wandered straight out of a fairy tale.

Whispers erupted the moment she entered.

"Who is that? She’s mesmerizing! Have we met before?"

"That’s Evelyn Thorne, the eldest daughter of Thornfield Industries. You know—the company on the verge of collapse?"

"Ah, that family. What’s she doing here? And that dress—is that Shanel haute couture? Since when could she afford such luxury?"

Evelyn ignored the murmurs, scanning the room for Dominic.

Her feet ached in the towering heels, so she slipped into an empty chair, only to be immediately accosted by two impeccably dressed women.

"Miss Thorne, is that gown authentic Shanel?" one asked, her tone dripping with faux curiosity.

Evelyn glanced down at the fabric.

Had Dominic really given her haute couture?

"Is there a problem?" she countered coolly.

The woman smirked. "With your family’s financial state, I doubt you could afford the real thing. Wearing a knockoff to an event like this is… embarrassing, don’t you think?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "If it were fake, the embarrassment would be mine. Why does it concern you?"

The women exchanged mocking glances before bursting into laughter.

"Tell us, Miss Thorne—how did you get in? Surely you weren’t invited?"

Evelyn’s lips curved into a cold smile. "I walked in on my own two feet."

The crowd’s attention shifted to her shoes—rare, limited-edition Armeses, unmistakably genuine.

A hushed realization spread.

"Did you find yourself a sugar daddy, Miss Thorne?" someone sneered.

Evelyn leaned back, unfazed. "Absolutely. How else would someone like me mingle with elites like you?"

The room fell silent.

Then, with a smirk, she added, "And if he’s generous enough to dress me like this… just imagine how powerful he must be."

###Chapter 35 

"Absolutely true. The man's wealth is obscene. Just ancient, hideous, and practically on death's door."

The guests exchanged puzzled glances, mentally cataloging every elderly billionaire in attendance.

A server approached Evelyn with perfect posture. "Miss Thorne, you're requested on the upper level."

Her head snapped up.

The venue's open architecture revealed the second-floor balcony clearly from the main hall.

Dominic's personal guard stood at the railing, his gaze locked on her.

As the waiter guided her away, the crowd's smirks transformed into stunned silence.

This wasn't just any gala - it was a meticulously curated hierarchy of power.

While the merely wealthy mingled below, true influence gathered upstairs.

"Evelyn Thorne ascending to the upper level? Who the hell is backing her?"

"Must be someone terrifyingly connected if she's getting that invitation! Even if he's a fossil, she's struck gold!"

"I've scanned the guest list twice - there aren't that many elderly moguls here tonight."

"Was she playing us all along?"

Dozens of eyes tracked her progress, but the upper level remained shrouded in mystery.

The private dining area held fewer than ten seats, all occupied by men who controlled empires.

Evelyn took the empty chair beside Dominic without hesitation.

Before them, culinary masterpieces adorned the table.

She turned to him, eyebrow arched. "You didn't drag me here for canapés, surely."

Dominic studied her expression before murmuring, "Julian's expected. Since you couldn't resist seeing him behind my back during my trip, I'm granting you a proper reunion."

The revelation caught her off guard.

Did he truly believe she pined for Julian? That she couldn't function without him?

Pathetic.

Starving from skipping dinner, Evelyn focused on her plate rather than arguing.

Her silverware clinked against fine china as she ate with single-minded determination.

"Mr. Blackwood, your nephew still owes me three million. Normally I'd write it off, but given your... strained relations, I'll have to collect directly."

"Caught him grooming my daughter last month. Twenty years old! When the investment scam failed, he tried seduction. Disgusting creature."

"Julian Whitmore's the laughingstock of finance. Every venture implodes spectacularly. Almost pitiful if he weren't so arrogant. Only his father's money keeps him afloat."

As the vitriol flowed, Dominic's attention shifted to Evelyn.

"Checking if I've lost my appetite?" She met his gaze coolly. "The food's exquisite, though the pasta's al dente. I'm finished."

Cutlery discarded, she stood. "This conversation bores me. I'm leaving."

His hand closed around her wrist like a vise.

Evelyn twisted futilely against his grip.

"Are you that desperate for entertainment?" she hissed. "I've a thesis deadline. Release me or I'll email you the draft to complete yourself."

His fingers loosened at her glare.

Downstairs, Julian swayed slightly, champagne flute in hand, groveling before a group of investors.

Evelyn turned on her heel without a second glance.

When Dominic returned to Mooncrest Manor at ten, Mrs. Wilkins greeted him anxiously. "Has Madam Evelyn returned with you, sir?"

He checked his watch, brow furrowing. "She departed at eight. She's not home?"
###Chapter 36

"Mrs. Wilkins informed me that Madam Evelyn hasn't returned home," the housekeeper said with concern. "I've been keeping watch in the parlor all evening, but she never appeared."

Dominic's expression darkened instantly.

If she wasn't at the manor, where could she possibly be?

Had she deceived him about going home to work on her dissertation?

"I'll try calling her immediately," Mrs. Wilkins offered, hurrying toward the antique telephone in the hall.

Unbeknownst to them, Evelyn had been snatched the moment she stepped outside Mooncrest Manor, now transported across Ravenshore against her will.

Strong hands had forced her into an unmarked vehicle, where they bound her wrists and covered her eyes with a rough cloth.

The car traveled for what felt like an eternity before finally screeching to a stop.

She was hauled into an unfamiliar building and shoved into a cold metal chair.

When the blindfold was ripped away, a distorted male voice greeted her.

"Forgive the unpleasantness, Miss Thorne. We're merely professionals completing an assignment. No harm will come to you if you comply."

Evelyn's eyes darted around the sterile white room before landing on her captor.

The black ski mask concealed his identity completely, and his voice held no recognizable inflection.

"I'll cooperate within reason," she stated evenly. "But I won't participate in anything unlawful, regardless of your threats."

The man emitted a humorless chuckle. "I sincerely doubt someone of your... delicate constitution could manage anything criminal."

With surprising gentleness, he freed her wrists only to attach electrodes to her fingertips.

"This polygraph doesn't tolerate deception. Answer truthfully or you'll regret it. One lie detected, and you won't see daylight again. Understood?"

Evelyn studied the blinking machine, weighing her options before giving a single nod.

"You needn't worry about dishonesty."

"Excellent." The interrogator adjusted his mask. "State your full name."

"Evelyn Rose Thorne."

"Did your father reveal the safe combination before his death?"

"No."

The man's eyes flicked to the polygraph readout.

Every indicator remained steady, confirming her veracity.

"Why were you at Mooncrest Manor tonight? Who summoned you?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

"Attempting deception?" he snarled. "Don't overthink - just answer!"

"I merely feared my response might... unsettle you," Evelyn countered smoothly. "Are you acquainted with the Blackwoods?"

"What?"

"Do you know Dominic Blackwood?" Evelyn pressed.

The man snorted. "Everyone knows the Blackwood heir. What's your connection? Did he invite you?"

Evelyn shook her head slowly. "Are you familiar with his cousin, Julian Whitmore?"

"Enough! I ask the questions here!" The captor's fist slammed onto the metal table. "Stop playing games!"

"Julian Whitmore escorted me there," Evelyn conceded.

"Define your relationship."

"Our connection is... intimate. Surely a man of your experience understands?"

The interrogator waved impatiently. "Enough semantics! Did you access your father's safe? This is critical - my employer already knows the truth! This test is merely confirmation!"

Meeting his glare, Evelyn deliberated before answering. "I did open it. But the contents aren't in my possession."

"Who possesses them?!"

Evelyn's lips curved faintly. "I believe I mentioned him earlier."

"Dominic Blackwood?"

A headshake.

"Your lover? Julian Whitmore?" The man's voice dripped with disgust.

Evelyn's nod was barely perceptible.
###Chapter 37

Evelyn had no choice but to make Julian the fall guy this time.

With Vincent discovering the missing documents, she needed to redirect his suspicions before the situation escalated beyond her control.

Her phone buzzed abruptly in the silent night.

The thug rummaged through her purse and produced the ringing device.

"Blackwood Manor" flashed across the illuminated screen.

"Well, well. Since you're cozy with the Blackwoods, I won't detain you further." The man practically shoved the phone at her. "Get out of here!"

Crossing the Blackwood family wasn't worth his paycheck. He'd already completed his assignment anyway.

The moment she was released, Evelyn immediately returned Mrs. Wilkins' call.

"Madam! Where are you? It's past midnight!" The housekeeper's voice crackled with concern through the receiver.

Evelyn scanned her surroundings with growing dread.

She stood on a desolate forest road, the skeletal trees casting eerie shadows under the pale moonlight. The path resembled a monstrous throat waiting to swallow her whole.

"Is Dominic's driver available?" Her teeth chattered against the autumn chill. She still wore only her evening gown. "I can't find transportation here."

"Master Dominic just returned with him. I'll send him immediately - share your location."

Within minutes, Evelyn transmitted her coordinates to the Blackwood household.

This abandoned stretch of road saw little traffic even in daylight - at night, it was practically suicidal to be stranded here.

"Dispatch a team to investigate this location immediately," Dominic ordered his head of security through gritted teeth.

Nearly three hours later, the Blackwood limousine finally pulled into the estate's courtyard.

Mrs. Wilkins frowned when the driver exited alone. "Where is Madam Evelyn?"

"Asleep in the backseat," the driver explained, shifting uncomfortably. "I didn't think it proper to carry her, nor could I bear to wake her."

The housekeeper opened the rear door to find Evelyn curled up like an exhausted child.

"Madam, you're home!" Mrs. Wilkins gently shook her shoulder. "Master Dominic has been waiting up all night - he was beside himself with worry."

Dominic had remained planted in the grand parlor for hours, his stony expression belying his concern.

Though he'd never admit it, Mrs. Wilkins recognized the telltale signs - the man was clearly developing feelings for his wife.

His insistence on the abortion stemmed from wanting to preserve their future together, not destroy it.

"He waited for me?" Evelyn's exhaustion vanished instantly. "Is he going to interrogate me?"

"Nothing so dramatic. He simply feared for your safety," the housekeeper assured her.

Evelyn's shoulders relaxed as she stepped into her slippers. Then she froze.

From her peripheral vision, she caught Dominic striding toward the elevator - without his wheelchair.

Her breath hitched. "His legs...?"

"He's regained mobility, though not for extended periods," Mrs. Wilkins confirmed proudly. "The wheelchair is still needed occasionally, but full recovery is imminent."

"You're pleased about his progress, aren't you?" The housekeeper's knowing smile made Evelyn's cheeks flush.

Evelyn's gaze lingered on Dominic's retreating form. His steps had slowed almost imperceptibly.

"Of course," she replied airily. "The sooner he recovers, the sooner he can return to work and stop hovering around the house!"

Dominic's shoulders tensed visibly. He spun around, his stormy expression promising retribution.
###Chapter 38

"My point is, how exactly are you going to afford those designer gowns and Louboutins if you don't hustle harder?"

Evelyn had slipped into her house shoes and sauntered toward Dominic, adding with deliberate nonchalance, "Never owned anything this luxurious before."

"How tragic for you," Dominic sneered before stepping into the elevator without another glance.

Evelyn bit back her retort as the doors slid shut.

She itched to lecture him about his obscenely lavish lifestyle, but the moment had passed.

Back in her suite, she peeled off the couture dress and stepped under the shower's steaming spray.

The scalding water cascaded over her skin, temporarily washing away the day's tensions.

At Thornfield Industries the next morning, Evelyn arrived before anyone else.

By 10 AM, the boardroom was packed to capacity.

"Good morning everyone. I'm Evelyn Thorne." Her voice cut through the murmurs. "Last night, I was kidnapped."

Gasps erupted around the table. "My God! Are you alright?" someone blurted.

"Perfectly fine." Evelyn's calm demeanor contrasted with the room's shock. "But our situation isn't. Investors see us as bargain hunters' prey. The offers we're getting wouldn't cover half our debts."

"We should unveil the Cerebra System!" a developer shouted, sparking enthusiastic agreement. "One press conference and investors will be lining up!"

"My father would never sell Thornfield." Evelyn's tone turned glacial. "And Cerebra isn't market-ready. Its current value is... theoretical at best."

"So we just watch the company implode?" another executive demanded.

"Without immediate capital? Essentially, yes." Evelyn didn't flinch.

Vincent Holloway slammed both palms on the table. "You're hoarding Cerebra for yourself! Your father didn't build it alone!"

Evelyn's gaze could have frozen lava. "Mr. Holloway, if you truly believe that, assemble your own team. Recreate Cerebra. Succeed, and I'll personally endorse selling it."

Vincent's face purpled with rage.

Everyone knew Richard Thorne had been Cerebra's irreplaceable architect. Without him, the system was impossible to replicate.

"You claim to honor your father while handing his life's work to Julian Whitmore—"

"Ah." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "So you were behind last night's abduction?"

Vincent recoiled as if struck.

"If you're clinging to Thornfield expecting a windfall," Evelyn continued, "cut your losses now." Her stare swept the room. "Anyone sharing Mr. Holloway's sentiments may collect their final paychecks today."

Vincent and two senior R&D leads stormed out, their exit punctuated by slamming doors.

"Who knew Evelyn Thorne had fangs beneath that sweet face?"

"She claims Julian has Cerebra, but I don't buy it!"

"Track Julian first. We'll see what he really knows."

At noon, Evelyn met Sophie Mercer at Villa Serenade.

"Finally!" Sophie pouted. "I was starting to think you'd forgotten me!" She leaned in conspiratorially. "Still no luck finding investors for Thornfield?"

###Chapter 39

Evelyn sighed, running a hand through her hair. "It's been tough, Adrian," she admitted. "Launching a self-driving program right now seems impossible. Even the most cutting-edge AI can't compete with human intuition. If I don't believe in it, why would investors?"

Adrian smirked, swirling his drink. "You're thinking too small. People invest in vision, not just results. There’s a gala tonight—full of heirs and moguls. Want to tag along? You might find someone willing to take a chance on you."

Evelyn scoffed. "A room full of trust-fund babies? No thanks. I need self-made tycoons, not spoiled brats."

"They’ll be there too," Adrian countered, nudging her. "Besides, I need backup. My father set me up on a blind date. Moral support?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes but relented. "Fine."

By seven, they arrived at the Oceanview Grand Hotel, its chandeliers casting a golden glow over the elite crowd.

"Let’s split up," Adrian suggested. "Easier for you to scout investors."

Evelyn nodded. "Don’t worry, I won’t cramp your date’s style."

Adrian grinned. "Keep your phone close. I’ll text if I need an escape."

"Got it."

They entered the ballroom separately. Evelyn grabbed a flute of champagne and lingered near the edge, scanning the room.

She spotted Adrian’s date almost immediately.

Her breath hitched.

That face—she knew it.

Dominic Blackwood.

They’d met once before at Thornfield Industries, a tense encounter that left her unsettled.

Evelyn set her glass down and fired off a text.

Evelyn: Who’s your date? He looks familiar.

Adrian’s phone lit up mid-conversation. She glanced at the screen, then replied.

Adrian: Dominic Blackwood. You know him?

Evelyn: I do!!!

Adrian: That reaction… Did something happen? I can ditch him.

Evelyn: No! But he’s sitting on a fortune—hundreds of millions. He’s been eyeing my father’s company.

Adrian: Seriously? He looks too young for that kind of wealth.

Evelyn: Trust me. Something’s off about him. Play along, but don’t mention me.

Adrian: Got it. I’ll dig for info.

While Adrian typed, Dominic’s gaze drifted across the room—and locked onto Evelyn.

His lips curved into a slow, knowing smile.

Then he pulled out his phone.

Dominic: Interesting place for a married woman, Evelyn. Or should I say… Mrs. Blackwood?
###Chapter 40

Evelyn's phone buzzed fifteen minutes later.

She answered the call, hung up, then quickly texted Sophie before rushing toward the hotel exit.

Adrian watched Evelyn's retreating figure with amusement.

How had she managed to find men willing to deceive Dominic Blackwood behind his back?

Exclusive material by N?(/v)elDrama.Org.

Why couldn’t she just stay obediently by his side?

Where on earth would she find someone better than Dominic Blackwood?

Adrian had no clue what was going through her mind.

Sophie’s reply came swiftly: [What’s the hurry? Is it really that urgent?]

Evelyn: [Extremely urgent! I’ll explain later!]

The caller had been Dominic’s bodyguard.

His message was clear—wait at the hotel entrance, or suffer the consequences.

Evelyn still remembered the last time she had defied him. The man was ruthless.

Even if he was just following Dominic’s orders, she wasn’t taking any chances.

A sleek black car pulled up in front of her fifteen minutes later.

The window rolled down, revealing the bodyguard’s cold, unreadable expression.

Evelyn climbed into the backseat, and the car sped off before she could even shut the door properly.

"You know, Miss Thorne," the bodyguard began, voice dripping with disdain. "If Mr. Blackwood kept a dog for a few months, it would at least learn loyalty. Why can’t you?"

"Are you implying I’m worse than a dog?" Evelyn shot back.

"That’s exactly what I’m saying," he sneered. "All you’ve done is leech off him and make his life miserable."

"You think I enjoy this?" Evelyn snapped. "If you hate me so much, convince him to divorce me."

"You’re unbelievable!" the bodyguard growled, slamming a fist against the steering wheel. "I don’t know what he sees in you."

Evelyn stiffened. She tried to stay calm, but the words spilled out before she could stop them.

"If he loved me, would he have forced me to get rid of my baby?"

"Did you really expect him to raise another man’s child?"

"What if it wasn’t someone else’s?" Evelyn challenged. "He still wouldn’t have let me keep it."

"Then don’t have one!" the bodyguard snapped. "If you were half as smart as Miss Chamberlain, you wouldn’t be in this mess."

Evelyn turned to stare out the window. "That’s your opinion. I want children. If he can’t accept that, how can you say he loves me?"

The bodyguard exhaled sharply, frustration evident.

After a tense silence, Evelyn suddenly asked, "Why do you think he loves me? Because I don’t see it."

"He slept with you, didn’t he?" the bodyguard ground out. "What else would you call that?"

"That’s your definition of love?" Evelyn scoffed.

"He sent me to check on you after what happened in the outskirts last night. Doesn’t that mean anything to you?"

Evelyn froze.

She hadn’t expected Dominic to investigate her.

"And how exactly did I repay him?" she asked cautiously.

The bodyguard’s glare was answer enough.

"You told them you went to Forrance with Julian Whitmore. That you had a great relationship with him and passed him something important. You’re a liar and a cheat!"

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "So he’s angry again?"

"You think this is funny? He’ll make you regret it!"

"I was testing the lie detector," Evelyn muttered. "Waste of money. I didn’t think he’d dig deeper."

"I told you—he loves you! Why won’t you believe me?" the bodyguard shouted, voice raw with frustration.
###Chapter 41

Perhaps it was because Dominic Blackwood had never shown favor to many people in his life that when he displayed even the slightest hint of emotion toward someone, everyone assumed he was in love.

The kind of love Evelyn Thorne dreamed of was built on mutual respect—not one where power and control were entirely in one person’s hands.

When the car pulled up to the Blackwood mansion, the bodyguard stepped out and approached Dominic immediately.

"Miss Thorne mentioned in the car that what she said last night was just to test the lie detector," the bodyguard explained, likely fearing Dominic’s temper.

Evelyn lingered at the front door, slipping into her house slippers with deliberate slowness. Her ears were sharp, catching every word.

"She also said she never intended to anger you," the bodyguard added.

"Does she not have a mouth of her own? Why are you speaking for her?" Dominic snapped.

The bodyguard quickly retreated, but not before shooting Evelyn a warning glare—as if to say her days were numbered if she didn’t fix this.

Evelyn sauntered over to Dominic, her steps unhurried.

She settled onto the couch across from him, gathering her courage before speaking.

But Dominic beat her to it.

"Did you attend a singles party?" His voice was sharp, cutting through the silence.

Evelyn blinked. "Was that what it was? I had no idea. I only went because I heard there would be wealthy investors."

Dominic’s brows drew together. "And did you find any?"

"No," she admitted. "I was barely there ten minutes before your bodyguard called me."

"Are you blaming me?" His tone was dangerously soft.

Evelyn reached for an apple from the fruit bowl, taking a slow bite. "If I did blame you, would you give me the money?"

"In your dreams," he scoffed.

She chuckled. "Exactly why I won’t let you ruin my good mood."

"Ah, yes. The good mood from firing your vice president and two key researchers?"

Evelyn froze mid-bite.

Her almond-shaped eyes locked onto his. "Dominic, are you in love with me?"

If he wasn’t, why would he bother digging into every detail of her life?

The air between them thickened, time seeming to slow.

Evelyn shoved the apple back into her mouth, suddenly needing the distraction.

Dominic’s gaze burned into her, so intense she felt he might devour her whole.

Then, after a beat, he spoke.

"And you?"

Was he asking if she loved him?

Her pulse spiked, heat rushing to her cheeks.

"I wouldn’t say I’m in love with you," she stammered, "but I wouldn’t say I’m not either. I just… don’t have the courage to be."

The words tumbled out, messy and uncertain. She wasn’t even sure what she meant—only that she hoped he understood.

Fury flickered in his eyes, but his voice remained eerily calm.

"I’m not the monster you think I am, Evelyn. You don’t have to understand me, but you don’t need to fight me either."

"I’m not fighting you," she said, clearing her throat. "I just want to live my life my way."

A life that, clearly, didn’t include him.

Dominic lifted his coffee cup, taking a slow sip before changing the subject.

"Adrian Vaughn’s offer isn’t insignificant. If you sell at that price, you’d still have funds left after clearing the debt."

It took Evelyn a moment to realize he was talking about Thornfield Industries.

"My father wouldn’t have wanted it sold."

"Bankruptcy isn’t much different. Just a faster way to lose everything."

She exhaled sharply. "I appreciate the advice, but I’ll handle this my way."

Dominic laughed—a rare, low sound.

It was the first time she’d ever heard it.

And it was mesmerizing.

The only other time she’d seen him smile like that was in a photo—his arms wrapped around another woman, his expression tender.
###Chapter 42

Evelyn couldn't help but wonder—if that woman was still alive, would she be his mistress?

And if she was dead… was she merely her replacement?

Either possibility twisted her heart into knots, leaving a bitter taste in her mouth.

As Evelyn drowned in her thoughts, Dominic’s mind wandered too.

He pulled out his cigarette box, his expression unreadable. "Tell me," he said, voice low, "what exactly did you see in Julian?"

"I don’t like him anymore," Evelyn replied flatly.

If they hadn’t cleared the air earlier, she might have kept using Julian to provoke him.

It was petty, but Dominic had a habit of exploding over the smallest things.

If she didn’t push back, she’d lose her sanity.

"Is it because you finally realized he’s a broke nobody?" Dominic flicked the unlit cigarette between his fingers.

"Is money the only thing you value?" Evelyn shot back. "When Julian was chasing me, he wrote me letters every day. He took me to museums and concerts. We had real conversations—"

"Sounds like pretentious nonsense," Dominic cut in, his voice sharp. "The only thing he cared about was getting into your pants. That’s why his business is a disaster. What you call ‘wonderful’ was just a joke."

"Were you always this perfect and successful? At fifteen, I liked cute boys. At sixteen, the smart ones. At seventeen, athletes. At eighteen, I fell for talent. I loved Julian. It’s in the past, and I might despise him now, but I won’t pretend it meant nothing."

"Enough!" Dominic snapped the cigarette in half, his eyes icy. "Go to your room."

Evelyn pressed her lips together and stood.

She didn’t go to her room, though. Instead, she headed to the dining area—she was still starving.

"Mrs. Wilkins, is there anything to eat?" she asked, her tone eerily calm, as if she hadn’t just been in a screaming match with Dominic.

Mrs. Wilkins quickly prepared dinner for her.

Evelyn sat at the table, pulling out her phone to see a flood of messages from Sophie.

Sophie: Party’s over. Not feeling him—too soft. He wasn’t into me either, but suggested dinner next time. Probably family pressure.

Sophie: He said his parents barely give him spending money. How could he have two hundred million? Did you mishear?

Sophie: Dinner this weekend. I need answers. Also, why’d you leave so fast?

Evelyn typed back: Long story. I’ll explain tomorrow.

Sophie called immediately.

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her phone.

She glanced toward the living room—Dominic was still there.

If she answered now, he’d hear everything.

She declined and texted: Can’t talk. See you on campus tomorrow.

Later that night, fresh from his shower, Dominic paced his room in a gray silk robe.

His legs, usually weak, now thrummed with restless energy.

A single question gnawed at him, carving deep lines into his brow and tightening his chest.

Finally, he grabbed his phone and called Nathan.

"Nathan, find me an art exhibition or concert tomorrow. Afternoon or evening."

"Yes, sir," Nathan replied. "Any particular theme or preference?"

Dominic froze.

He’d never stepped foot in a gallery or concert hall.

Even now, the idea bored him.

"Something women like," he muttered.

"Understood. Though, women’s tastes vary by age—"

"Just pick one," Dominic snapped.

Nathan fell silent. It was the first time Dominic had ever made such a bizarre request.
###Chapter 43

Why was Dominic inquiring about art exhibitions and symphony performances?

What could have caused such a dramatic shift in preferences?

"Choose something that would appeal to a woman in her early twenties," Dominic instructed.

Nathan finally pieced together what this was all about.

"Certainly, sir. I'll forward the tickets once they're confirmed."

Dominic was conspicuously absent from Blackwood Group headquarters the following morning.

Lucas and Nathan took advantage of his absence to speculate about their enigmatic boss.

"Mr. Blackwood might as well have spelled it out - he clearly wants to take Evelyn out," Nathan chuckled. "I wonder what transpired between them. This development is happening much faster than anticipated. Weren't they supposed to be finalizing their divorce?"

Lucas considered the situation carefully before responding, "My guess? They slept together. Dominic may be ruthless, but after experiencing Evelyn, I'd wager even his legendary self-control couldn't resist her, regardless of how much he claims to despise her."

"Bianca would have a complete meltdown if she found out," Nathan remarked.

"Don't breathe a word to her. She's been drowning her sorrows in alcohol every night, hoping Dominic would take pity on her..." Lucas sighed. "Who would have imagined she'd lose out to Evelyn Thorne of all people."

"Life works in mysterious ways. I'm curious why Mr. Blackwood cleared his entire schedule today," Nathan mused.

"Best not to pry into his personal affairs," Lucas cautioned.

Nathan shook his head emphatically. "Wouldn't dream of it."

That afternoon, Ravenswood University was hosting a lecture by world-renowned neurologist Sebastian Whitmore.

Evelyn arrived at the auditorium early to secure a prime seat.

The presentation ran from 10 a.m. until 11:30 a.m.

As soon as the lecture concluded, Evelyn made a beeline for the exit.

She held Professor Whitmore in the highest regard and wanted to seize this rare opportunity to consult him on a pressing question.

She trailed the professor's entourage all the way to the administration building, where her attention was caught by a sleek black luxury sedan parked prominently at the entrance.

Such high-end vehicles were uncommon sights on campus at any time.

What gave her pause was that it appeared identical to Dominic's personal car.

Unfortunately, she couldn't recall his license plate number to confirm whether it was actually his.

"What possible reason would he have to be here?" Evelyn muttered under her breath before entering the building.

As she approached the Dean's office, Evelyn spotted a familiar figure standing guard outside - unmistakably one of Dominic's security detail.

Her breath caught.

Did this mean the car outside really was Dominic's?

What business could he possibly have here?

Why would the CEO of Blackwood Group visit the medical school?

Evelyn's curiosity got the better of her, and she marched straight toward the office entrance.

"Miss Thorne?"

The bodyguard recognized her immediately and moved to intercept.

"What brings you here?" he inquired.

"I should be asking you that question. This is my university. Is Dominic inside?"

She deftly sidestepped the guard's attempt to block her and peered into the room.

Three figures occupied the space: Professor Whitmore, his assistant, and Dominic. Was Dominic here to consult the professor? For what purpose? Was he ill?
###Chapter 44

The security guard abruptly pulled Evelyn aside, making everyone in the office turn toward the commotion at the door.

When Dominic recognized Evelyn's delicate silhouette, he rose from his chair with a frown. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn wrenched her arm free from the guard's grasp, straightened her blouse, and stepped confidently into the office. "I came to see Professor Whitmore," she said, then tilted her head curiously at Dominic. "Are you here to see him too?"

Professor Whitmore adjusted his glasses as his gaze shifted between them. "Do you two know each other?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain their acquaintance, but Dominic spoke first. "Professor, our discussion must remain confidential."

"Naturally," the professor replied. "Doctor-patient privilege applies."

"I'll take my leave then," Dominic said curtly.

The professor nodded in acknowledgment.

As Dominic strode past Evelyn, their eyes met briefly. His gaze held an unreadable expression before he walked out without another word.

Evelyn stood frozen for a moment.

Why had he avoided her question?

What secret conversation had he been having with the professor? What was he hiding?

"Miss Thorne?" Professor Whitmore's voice snapped her back to reality. "I have another appointment in ten minutes. Did you need something?"

Evelyn quickly retrieved her prepared documents. "Professor, I apologize for the intrusion. I'm Evelyn Thorne, a senior at Ravenswood University with a medical minor. This is my analysis of several clinical cases from your published work. Since the online records lacked detail, I had to make some educated conclusions. I'd be honored if you could review it for accuracy."

Professor Whitmore accepted the folder and began flipping through the pages.

Meanwhile, Dominic sat in his car, staring at the medical building through tinted windows.

Was Evelyn studying medicine?

His background check clearly stated she was an art major. Had his information been wrong?

He pulled out his phone and dialed Nathan. "Your report said Evelyn was an art student. Why was she in the medical department?"

"Records confirm she's enrolled in the arts program, Mr. Blackwood. I verified it personally."

"I just saw her at Ravenswood's medical school."

"Let me investigate immediately," Nathan replied, then added, "I've sent the concert reservation details for 4 PM today."

"Understood."

Minutes later, Nathan called back. "Mr. Blackwood, Miss Thorne is indeed majoring in fine arts with a minor in medical sciences."

"I see."

"Quite impressive for someone her age."

Dominic ended the call without comment.

At noon, Evelyn met Sophie at a café near campus.

Sophie pushed the menu toward Evelyn with a teasing smile. "You've changed, Ev. You used to cancel every time I invited you out. Last night was our first outing in months, and you vanished like Cinderella at midnight. What's going on?"

"Sophie, was last night's party a singles event?" Evelyn asked pointedly.

"Obviously! Why?"

"Don't invite me to those anymore. I'm not single right now."

"What?!" Sophie nearly knocked over her water glass. "You just got out of a relationship! How did you rebound so fast?"
###Chapter 45

Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

"Sophie... I had no choice. When my family was drowning in debt, my stepmother sold me off for the dowry money. I'm still trying to get divorced!"

"What kind of medieval bullshit is this?!" Sophie exploded. "Why didn't you tell me earlier? We're filing a police report right now!"

Evelyn grabbed her friend's wrist to stop her. "It's not that dramatic. We live in completely different universes. The divorce should be finalized any day now."

Sophie wasn't buying it.

"Who is this mystery man? Tell me... your husband... God! This sounds like some bad romance novel!"

"It does sound ridiculous. I'll introduce you after the divorce papers are signed."

"No way! You're telling me now! I'll handle this for you!"

Evelyn knew Sophie's fiery temper all too well.

If she discovered it was Dominic Blackwood, she'd storm Blackwood Group headquarters immediately.

Things with Dominic were already tense enough without Sophie throwing gasoline on the fire.

"Just focus on investigating Adrian Vaughn first! I promise I'll tell you everything about my husband after that," Evelyn bargained.

"Oh ho! Listen to you calling him 'my husband' so casually. Bet you whisper 'darling' in his ear every night!" Sophie teased.

Evelyn's face burned. She exhaled sharply. "As if he'd acknowledge that. He was coerced into this marriage too."

"Really? I was picturing some greasy tycoon forcing you into a gold-plated cage-"

"Stop! You've been reading too many trashy novels! It's nothing like that!"

Sophie shook her head sympathetically. "Well, that senior in your department just lost his shot. You know he's crazy about you, right?"

Evelyn's expression turned to stone.

"Okay, okay! Don't give me that look... I know you're not interested. I'll let him down gently..." Sophie changed subjects abruptly. "Let's go to a concert after this! The Philharmonic has Alessandro performing today!"

Evelyn's phone buzzed with an unknown number, but the message style was unmistakable.

[The car will collect you at 4 p.m.]

It was signed "Dominic Blackwood."

Was this Dominic's private number?

Why was he sending a car for her?

"Earth to Evelyn! The concert starts at..." Sophie pinched her cheek to get her attention.

"What time does it begin?" Evelyn tucked her phone away, suddenly feeling feverish. She gulped her iced tea.

"Four thirty," Sophie answered. "It's Alessandro! Your favorite since college!" Evelyn rubbed her temples. "I'd love to go, really! But I have something at four I can't miss."

"What's so important? Can't you reschedule?"

"Impossible." Sophie rolled her eyes. "Let me guess - hubby dearest?"

Evelyn buried her face in her hands. Her silence spoke volumes.

"Why do you jump when he snaps his fingers? Who is this guy? Am I chopped liver? Just blow him off and come with me!" Sophie fumed. "You know you're more important, but... I kind of fear his wrath."

"What's he gonna do? Chain you in the basement if you disobey?"

Evelyn drained her glass.

"You're pathetic! Keeping his identity secret then letting him push you around? You deserve each other!"

Sophie was equal parts furious and heartbroken watching her strong-willed friend become so submissive.

The black sedan picked Evelyn up from campus precisely at four.

Twenty minutes later, it glided to a stop outside the Philharmonic Hall.

Evelyn's head spun as the bodyguard escorted her inside. "Dominic... is taking me to a concert?"

###Chapter 46

"I have no clue," the bodyguard muttered, his expression indifferent.

Evelyn inhaled sharply, her gaze darting around the venue.

If her memory was correct, this was the exact recital Sophie had mentioned earlier.

She had turned down Sophie’s invitation.

Yet here she was anyway.

The only difference? She was here with Dominic.

Running into Sophie in this concert hall would be beyond mortifying.

Her palms grew clammy, and she silently prayed she wouldn’t cross paths with her best friend.

In a venue this massive, the chances of sitting near each other were slim, right?

Nathan had reserved the entire front row for Dominic.

Evelyn spotted him the moment she stepped inside.

He sat alone, posture rigid, exuding an air of cold superiority.

With the performance yet to begin, he was scrolling through his phone, completely detached.

Her feet froze mid-step, as if rooted to the floor.

Dominic stood out like a storm in a clear sky.

Why had he even invited her to a recital?

Had he forgotten how he’d mocked her relationship with Julian just last night?

She had spoken passionately about the beauty of art, and he had dismissed it as trivial.

"Why are you just standing there? Move!" the bodyguard snapped, noticing her hesitation.

"I’m freezing… Could I borrow your jacket?" Evelyn asked politely, eyeing his black suit jacket.

The bodyguard’s expression darkened as he unbuttoned it, revealing an arsenal of weapons strapped beneath.

Her knees nearly buckled at the sight, and she hurried toward Dominic.

When she reached him, she hesitated, then deliberately sat two seats away.

Dominic’s gaze flicked to the empty space between them, his brow furrowing.

Was she avoiding him?

"It’s stuffy in here," Evelyn lied, fanning herself.

The bodyguard on Dominic’s other side scoffed. "Didn’t you just say you were cold?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Do you always talk this much? Bodyguards on TV know when to stay silent. Maybe focus on protecting your boss instead of commenting on everything?"

The bodyguard’s jaw tightened.

This infuriating woman.

Dominic shot him a look. "Move further down."

Without hesitation, the bodyguard stood and relocated several seats away.

Evelyn finally breathed easier.

She took another steadying breath, then an idea struck her.

Shrugging off her coat, she folded it neatly and placed it on the seat between them.

Then, she loosened her ponytail, letting her hair cascade forward to shield her face.

If Sophie didn’t come directly into her line of sight, she wouldn’t recognize her.

Dominic watched her with icy scrutiny, analyzing her every move.

Was she removing her coat to flaunt her figure?

Undoing her hair to appear more alluring?

To him, it was obvious she was playing games.

"Evelyn," he began, voice low.

"Don’t talk to me!" she hissed, keeping her face hidden. "My friends are here. I don’t want them knowing I came with you."

Dominic’s lips pressed into a thin line, his jaw clenching. The calm in his eyes shattered.
###Chapter 47

Dominic felt utterly ridiculous.

Why was Evelyn so desperate to avoid being spotted by her friends?

Was being seen with him truly that humiliating?

As the recital commenced, Evelyn finally relaxed.

Thank goodness Sophie hadn't recognized her!

She wondered where her best friend was seated.

The urge to turn around burned through her, but common sense prevailed.

Sophie sat in the fifth row with another companion, completely unaware.

"Look at that first row! Three people hogging all those premium seats. What a waste!" Sophie's friend complained while eyeing the sparsely occupied front section.

"Must be some wealthy folks," the friend continued. "Our fifth-row tickets cost nearly two hundred dollars! I can't imagine what those front seats go for. That man in the center practically screams billionaire. The woman beside him could be his daughter or mistress. And that muscular guy? Definitely security."

Sophie nodded in agreement.

"That woman on the left..." Sophie squinted. "She looks exactly like my best friend!"

"What kind of bestie would I be if I didn't recognize her silhouette?"

The resemblance grew more striking the longer Sophie stared.

Pulling out her phone discreetly, she snapped a quick photo.

"You can't take pictures here!" her friend hissed. "Just go check if you're so curious."

"Forget it," Sophie waved her off, already sending the image to Evelyn.

Evelyn's phone buzzed silently in her pocket.

Her heart nearly stopped when she saw Sophie's message:

[Evelyn, is this your doppelgänger?]

Panic surged through her veins, making her sink deeper into her seat.

Dominic noticed her strange behavior immediately and turned to investigate.

"Oh my God, he's gorgeous!" Sophie gasped when Dominic's striking profile came into view. "Wait—is that Dominic Blackwood?!" her friend shrieked. "The Dominic Blackwood?"

"Obviously!" Sophie confirmed. "Business major here, remember? That's definitely him."

Sophie sighed dramatically. "Well, that settles it. Can't be Evelyn then. What would she be doing with Dominic Blackwood?"

Another message buzzed through:

[Seriously, that man is Dominic Blackwood! Do you have any idea who he is? Billionaire CEO with model looks! I nearly fainted when he turned around!]

Evelyn stole a glance at Dominic.

Model looks?

She wasn't seeing it.

Another text arrived moments later:

[My friend wants a photo with him after the show. Should I ask too? Wonder if he'd agree...]

Evelyn's phone suddenly felt like a ticking bomb.

"Dominic," she whispered urgently, "I'm starving. Let's grab dinner now."

If they didn't leave immediately, she'd be exposed.

The thought terrified her.

Without waiting for his response, she grabbed her coat with one hand and his arm with the other, practically dragging him out while hunched over like a criminal.

Their recital experience ended abruptly in under ten minutes.

This marked Dominic Blackwood's first time accompanying a woman to such an event.

Cultural performances had never interested him, but he'd endured it solely for her enjoyment.

Given his status, Dominic naturally drew attention wherever he went.

Not only did Evelyn fail to appreciate this rare private moment, she seemed mortified at the prospect of being seen together.

Her actions delivered a stinging slap to his pride.

Once outside, Dominic violently shook off her grip and stormed away without a backward glance.

As she watched his retreating figure, realization dawned on Evelyn.

Had this been his idea of a date?

Even so... shouldn't dates require mutual agreement? Was this supposed to be some grand romantic surprise?

###Chapter 48 
Evelyn's breath grew increasingly uneven as she dwelled on the thought.

Could this mean Dominic truly loved her?

Why else would a man like him waste his precious time on something so trivial?

An icy shiver raced down her spine.

Her fingers unconsciously brushed against her still-flat stomach.

Exclusive material by N?(/v)elDrama.Org.

At three months pregnant, her careful diet had kept any visible signs at bay.

She could probably conceal it with loose clothing until month five or six.

But what about when she reached full term?

No expecting mother, no matter how slender, could hide that telltale bump forever.

If she remained by Dominic's side that long, discovery would be inevitable.

Evelyn wandered the city streets like a ghost.

The chilly evening air bit through her thin t-shirt, yet she barely registered the cold.

Her emotions toward Dominic were a tangled mess.

Just like she'd confessed last night.

She lacked the courage to love him, still resenting his past arrogance and controlling ways.

Yet she couldn't deny the flutter in her chest whenever he was near.

Too ashamed. Too scared to voice it aloud.

These unborn children stood between them like an impassable wall.

Keeping them meant leaving him.

She wasn't some unfeeling automaton - her heart and body didn't always obey logic's commands.

When had she started falling for Dominic? She couldn't pinpoint the moment.

She'd despised him when he demanded the abortion.

Returning home that evening, Evelyn spotted a gift box on the living room coffee table.

"Mrs. Wilkins, that's for Dominic. Please give it to him later," Evelyn instructed.

The housekeeper beamed. "Now that's more like it! Life's easier when Master Blackwood's pleased. If only for your own sake, you should mind his moods more."

Though sensible advice, Evelyn replied flatly, "I'm hungry."

"Dinner's ready. Why not eat now, then join Master Dominic when he returns?" Mrs. Wilkins suggested.

Evelyn shook her head sharply. "We're fighting. Separate meals are better for both of us."

Mrs. Wilkins fell silent.

What had Evelyn done to anger him this time?

Dominic's temper was legendary, but he rarely lost it without cause.

At Blackwood Group headquarters, Dominic remained in his office long after hours with no intention of leaving.

He'd arrived at five o'clock radiating dangerous energy.

Staff gave him wide berth; he spoke to no one.

Just worked relentlessly from five to six.

Nathan called Lucas for backup.

He didn't dare leave before the boss.

Dominic's foul mood had everyone on edge.

Hadn't he gone to a concert with Evelyn?

Why was he back before it ended?

Did she stand him up? Or did they argue?

Lucas arrived promptly after Nathan's call.

They conferred outside Dominic's office.

"She probably ditched him again," Nathan muttered. "I'd love to meet this Evelyn Thorne. There's something wrong with that woman. Of all people to provoke daily, she picks the boss."

"Maybe that's her strategy," Lucas mused. "Swimming against the current gets attention. No one else dares cross Dominic. Isn't it refreshing for him?"

"Nobody enjoys constant frustration," Nathan countered. "Unless Mr. Blackwood's secretly a masochist."

The office doors flew open. Dominic stormed out. Both men sprang to attention.
###Chapter 49

"Mr. Blackwood, should you be walking without your wheelchair?" Nathan asked with concern.

He knew Dominic had deliberately left the wheelchair behind today, not wanting any hindrance during his date with Evelyn. Rolling a wheelchair would have undoubtedly ruined the romantic atmosphere.

What a pity Evelyn failed to appreciate his boss's considerate gesture.

Dominic brushed past Nathan and Lucas.

His face was stony as he bit out, "I'm fine."

"Come have drinks with us, Dominic!" Lucas grabbed his arm again. "Tristan Chamberlain's in town. Let's invite him along."

Dominic's thunderous expression worried Lucas.

Tristan was Bianca's older brother.

Lucas had been the one to call Tristan when Bianca angered Dominic.

The Chamberlain family business was headquartered in Ravenshore City.

As heir to the Chamberlain empire, Tristan spent most of his time there.

After a tense silence, Dominic refused. "No."

He strode toward the elevator. Though not particularly fast, his steps were steady and confident.

While his love life was in shambles, his physical recovery progressed remarkably well.

Dominic arrived home at seven-thirty that evening.

Mrs. Wilkins immediately presented Evelyn's gift. "Madam Evelyn prepared this for you, Master Dominic."

The weighty box made Dominic curious about its contents.

"Is she home?" he inquired.

"Yes," Mrs. Wilkins replied. "She returned to her room after dinner to work on her thesis."

Dominic's lips thinned as he examined the gift box.

Had she bought this after realizing her rudeness?

Everyone deserved a second chance.

Evelyn's gesture softened his anger slightly.

He carefully opened the box to reveal... a book.

Its title glared up at him: "The Art of Anger Management," featuring a vibrant ginseng plant on its cover.

Dominic's brows knitted together tightly.

Was this her idea of an apology?!

Did she genuinely want to make amends, or was she deliberately provoking him further?!

Mrs. Wilkins' smile vanished instantly upon seeing the book.

She mentally retracted all her earlier praise for Evelyn.

"Shall I fetch Madam Evelyn to explain? I'm certain she meant no offense," Mrs. Wilkins offered hastily.

"Forget it!" Dominic snapped through clenched teeth, slamming the book onto the table.

Upstairs, Evelyn flinched at the loud noise.

There was method behind her gift choice.

One of her professors had recommended this book, which she'd found genuinely insightful regarding mental and physical health connections.

It had broadened her perspective, showing how emotional balance could prevent certain illnesses.

Wasn't that valuable? Why was he angry again?

Did he consider her gift too inexpensive?

Her limited budget couldn't accommodate extravagant presents.

Evelyn's pulse quickened with anxiety. She debated whether to confront Dominic downstairs.

Just then, her door flew open, revealing Dominic's towering, muscular frame filling the doorway.
###Chapter 50

A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine as beads of cold sweat formed on her forehead.

Her fingers trembled as she slammed the laptop closed with unnecessary force.

This wasn't how she normally handled her research documents.

In her panicked state earlier, she'd created a new file and typed out a plan.

A detailed plan to secure her divorce from Dominic within ninety days.

Evelyn needed to be free before her pregnancy reached the seven-month mark.

That was the only way she could safely navigate the final trimester and deliver the twins without complications.

If her plan failed, disappearing would become her only option.

The thought made her stomach churn.

Ravenswood was her home. She wanted to raise her children here, surrounded by familiar streets and memories.

Dominic's sharp gaze burned into her as he noticed her defensive reaction.

Did she honestly think he cared about her academic work?

Or was she hiding something far more interesting than a thesis?

Seeing the storm brewing in Dominic's expression, Evelyn quickly stood and maneuvered past him toward the doorway.

"You didn't like the book I gave you?" she asked softly, her voice deliberately light as she slipped into the living room. "It's actually quite valuable - full of cutting-edge health research. The author studied under my advisor's mentor. He's quite renowned in medical circles."

She continued talking as she retrieved the book from the coffee table, buying time to steady her breathing.

Dominic remained silent, momentarily distracted by her unexpected lecture.

"Each chapter stands alone, so you can start anywhere," Evelyn added, forcing a smile. "Perfect for when you have a few spare minutes."

Mrs. Wilkins perked up from her corner. "It sounds fascinating! Maybe I should get a copy too."

"I'd be happy to pick one up for you tomorrow," Evelyn offered.

"Oh no, dear, I couldn't ask you to-"

"It's no trouble at all," Evelyn interrupted. "They were practically giving them away during the bookstore sale. Only one fifty."

The moment the price left her lips, Mrs. Wilkins' smile stiffened.

The housekeeper wasn't offended by the modest cost, but she cringed inwardly for Evelyn.

After angering Mr. Blackwood, this was the peace offering she'd chosen? A discounted book she'd casually admitted cost barely more than a coffee?

Evelyn sensed the sudden tension thickening the air.

She inhaled deeply before gesturing to the gift box. "This packaging actually cost more than the book itself!"

Even as she said it, she knew no elegant box could compensate for her thoughtless admission.

"Thank you, Mrs. Thorne," Mrs. Wilkins said hurriedly. "If you'll excuse me, I should check on dinner." The housekeeper practically fled to the kitchen.

Evelyn risked a glance at Dominic.

His expression had shifted from thunderous to something more... perplexed.

Either her audacity had stunned him into silence, or he'd decided she wasn't worth the energy.

Who in their right mind would present a Blackwood with a dollar-fifty gift?

The absurdity of it seemed to have short-circuited his anger.

Seeing his calm demeanor, Evelyn felt some of her tension ease.

Concern creeping into her voice, she asked, "Why were you meeting with Professor Whitmore earlier? Is everything alright?"

Before he could respond, she grabbed a banana from the fruit bowl and thrust it toward him.

"Here, eat this. I should get back to work."

As their fingers brushed during the exchange, an electric current seemed to pass between them.

Evelyn jerked her hand back, cheeks flaming.

She turned to leave, but Dominic caught her wrist in a firm grip.

"Not so fast," he murmured, his voice dangerously low. "We haven't discussed what happened earlier."

Whether her gift cost one dollar or a million, Evelyn still owed him an explanation for disrupting his entire afternoon.
###Chapter 51

Evelyn felt her breath catch under Dominic's intense, smoldering gaze.

"About leaving the concert early today..." she began after a brief hesitation. "My friend messaged saying she wanted a photo with you afterward. I assumed you wouldn't appreciate taking pictures with strangers, and I didn't want to explain why we were there together."

"Why not?" Dominic's voice was like winter frost.

"It's not exactly a simple explanation, is it?" Evelyn countered. "We're from completely different worlds - not just in social standing but... in age too. Would you really want to spend time with my friends? We can be quite childish at times... Wouldn't it bother you if they pestered you about our relationship? Doesn't one less complication sound better?"

The unspoken truth was far simpler - their marriage could end any day. There were no guarantees they'd stay together forever.

If Evelyn introduced Dominic to her circle only to divorce the next day... The humiliation would be unbearable.

Better to wait until things were more certain.

Her thorough explanation seemed to soothe Dominic somewhat.

Her concerns weren't unfounded.

He had zero interest in her friends.

Beyond Evelyn, he had no desire to interact with anyone significantly younger or less mature.

"Return to your room," Dominic finally said, his lips barely moving.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, as if granted a royal pardon.

She peeled a banana and stubbornly pushed it toward him.

"These are Goldfinger bananas - my absolute favorite. They taste completely different from regular ones. Try it," she urged, eyes shining with anticipation.

Dominic hesitated at the fruit's bruised appearance but couldn't bring himself to refuse.

He accepted the banana and took a cautious bite.

An initial tartness gave way to surprising sweetness as he chewed.

The texture was starchier than expected, creating a unique flavor profile.

"Don't judge by the outside - it's perfect inside," Evelyn said with a bright smile. "And thank you for taking me to the concert today. Even though we left early, I really appreciated it."

She rushed the words out, then darted to her room before he could respond, closing the door firmly behind her.

Dominic stood perplexed.

Was this her idea of gratitude?

While her sincerity was evident, she could have at least waited until he finished eating before fleeing.

The next morning, Mrs. Wilkins noticed Evelyn hadn't come down for breakfast, with Dominic waiting pointedly in the living room.

Though he didn't say it, the housekeeper guessed he wanted to dine with Evelyn.

When knocking brought no response, Mrs. Wilkins entered Evelyn's room.

After a quick assessment, she returned to report, "Madam Evelyn is asleep at her desk, Master Dominic. She must have worked through the night. Perhaps you should breakfast without her."

Before she finished speaking, Dominic was already striding toward Evelyn's bedroom.

He lifted the sleeping woman from her chair and gently placed her on the bed.

She didn't stir - her slumber was that deep.

She couldn't have been asleep long.

Why push herself so hard for a thesis?

Dominic's gaze shifted to the laptop on the desk.

An outdated model from a defunct brand - no wonder it had crashed before, forcing her to use his study computer.

Approaching the desk, he noticed the screen's slight blurriness and pressed the power button.

The display illuminated, showing a sparse desktop with few icons.

Among them - Evelyn's thesis and a file labeled "The Plan," which Dominic opened without hesitation.

The document's title stood out in bold capital letters: "THREE-MONTH DIVORCE PLAN"!
###Chapter 52

The document beneath the title was brief and to the point—Evelyn hadn’t been able to devise a perfect escape plan, no matter how much she racked her brain.

A single line stood out in bold: (Divorce Dominic Blackwood by year’s end—no matter what.)

A storm of fury and resentment darkened Dominic’s expression.

He had been trying to change, to become better—for her. Yet here she was, still determined to leave him.

Exclusive material by NovelDrama.Org.

She had created this file last night… She had played him for a fool!

While she showered him with gifts and sweet words, she had been locked away in her room, plotting her exit.

Dominic had believed Evelyn was different. But the only thing that set her apart was how expertly she wore two faces.

He slammed the laptop shut and stormed out.

——

The executives at Blackwood Group immediately noticed their CEO’s foul mood the moment he stepped into the boardroom.

His jaw was clenched, his gaze glacial.

An unspoken tension radiated from him, thick enough to suffocate the room.

Every department head sat rigidly, barely daring to breathe.

The company’s third-quarter results had surpassed expectations—so why was their president seething?

Dominic didn’t speak a single word throughout the meeting. He listened to each report with detached indifference.

Only when it ended did he finally utter, "Dismissed," before striding out without another glance.

Nathan Cross moved to follow, but one of the managers caught his arm.

"What’s wrong with Mr. Blackwood?" the man whispered urgently. "If he’s unhappy with our performance, he should just say so! We’ll fix it!"

"Yeah, this silence is worse than criticism," another added. "Does he have some new strategy in mind?"

Nathan adjusted his glasses with a sigh. "The company’s performance was stellar. This isn’t about work."

He lowered his voice. "It’s personal."

Without elaborating, he hurried after Dominic.

——

Nathan pushed open the office door without knocking—only to freeze when he spotted the visitor inside.

"Mr. Chamberlain," he greeted stiffly.

Tristan Chamberlain flashed a charming smile. "Just borrowing your boss for a moment, Nathan."

Taking the hint, Nathan retreated, shutting the door behind him.

The moment they were alone, Tristan’s smile vanished.

"My parents sent me to bring Bianca home," he said, frustration lacing his tone. "But she refuses to listen to me. You’re the only one she’ll obey."

Without hesitation, Dominic picked up his phone and dialed Bianca’s number.

She answered instantly, her voice bright. "Dominic? Is everything okay?"

"Resign. Go home with your brother," he said flatly.

Tristan’s eyebrows shot up at the blunt command.

A beat of silence. Then—

"Did Tristan put you up to this?" Bianca hissed. "Ignore him! I’m not leaving!"

The line went dead.

Dominic set the phone down and leveled Tristan with an icy glare. "How many times have I cleaned up her messes? This is the last. Handle your family drama yourself."

Recognizing the dangerous edge in his tone, Tristan stood abruptly. "Right. I’ll see myself out."

As he stepped into the hallway, he caught Nathan’s arm. "What the hell’s going on? I’ve never seen Dominic this volatile."

Nathan sighed. "The company’s fine. His marriage isn’t."

Tristan’s eyes gleamed with interest. "He’s married? To who?"

"Evelyn Thorne."

"Ah." Tristan smirked. "So the great Dominic Blackwood has fallen for a girl barely out of college. How… unexpected."
###Chapter 53

"Perhaps it's destiny," Nathan murmured.

"My poor sister deserves better," Tristan countered coldly.

"Forgive my bluntness, Mr. Chamberlain," Nathan continued. "Bianca is extraordinary, yet after all these years by Mr. Blackwood's side, his heart remains untouched. Even if she dedicates another twenty, thirty years... His affection will never be hers."

A dangerous glint flashed in Tristan's eyes as he replied, "How... enlightening."

That night, Dominic hosted a dinner for Blackwood Group's executives.

Afterwards, Lucas insisted they continue drinking elsewhere.

The entire room sensed Dominic's dark mood, though none dared ask why.

Which explained why they unanimously decided to get him thoroughly drunk.

When Dominic's gaze grew unfocused, Lucas discreetly replaced his whiskey with orange juice.

"Bottling things up isn't healthy," Lucas remarked, watching Dominic rub his temples. "Talk to me."

Dominic's long fingers pressed against his forehead as he confessed in a husky voice, "Evelyn wants a divorce. Am I truly so... inadequate?"

The room plunged into shocked silence.

Inadequate? Their billionaire CEO?

Had Evelyn Thorne lost her mind?

Dominic Blackwood wasn't just wealthy - he was a business prodigy, a man women would cross continents for!

Who did she think she was, wounding him like this?

"What's your take on Miss Thorne, Lucas?" Nathan inquired.

"Just some college girl," Lucas shrugged, then reconsidered. "Actually no - she's stunning. If Bianca's beauty is lethal, Evelyn's is... comforting. Like sunshine."

"I've never met her! Should we invite her?" someone suggested.

Lucas glanced at Dominic's pained expression and reached for his phone.

"Let's have Evelyn take you home," Lucas declared.

Dominic's breathing hitched.

Taking his silence as consent, Lucas made the call.

At Mooncrest Manor, Evelyn was editing her thesis when Dominic's name flashed on her screen.

The unfamiliar voice made her stomach clench.

"Miss Thorne? Are you free tonight?"

"This is...?"

"Dominic's had too much to drink. We need you to collect him."

"Where's his security detail? Surely they're sober?"

The men exchanged startled looks.

"No bodyguard tonight," Lucas replied. "Will you come?"

Evelyn grabbed her coat. "Send the address."

Forty minutes later, Evelyn arrived at Villa Serenade to find a group of executives clustered at the entrance.

Their collective stare made her cheeks burn as she burrowed deeper into her coat.

Lucas propelled Dominic toward her. "Even if you don't love him," he said pointedly, "don't you dare break him."

Evelyn nearly dropped the staggering billionaire. "Break him?" she scoffed. "If only I could! The man's unbreakable."

Dominic's eyes flew open. In one fluid motion, he spun her against the car, his breath hot against her lips.
###Chapter 54

Evelyn caught the sharp scent of whiskey mixed with Dominic's distinctive cologne the moment he leaned in.

Her breath hitched when she noticed Lucas Grant's entourage pulling out their phones, lenses pointed directly at them.

They were clearly in cahoots with Lucas.

With a sudden burst of strength, Evelyn pushed Dominic away, only to immediately grab his arm when he staggered.

The chauffeur rushed over, and together they maneuvered Dominic into the backseat of the luxury sedan.

After securing his seatbelt, the driver handed Evelyn a chilled bottle of Evian.

Flushed from exertion, she uncapped it and took several deep swallows.

"That was for Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood," the driver murmured.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks.

She hastily extended the bottle toward Dominic. "Would you like some water?"

His eyes remained closed, brows knitted in obvious discomfort.

No response.

Evelyn bit her lip. Had he not heard her, or was he deliberately ignoring her?

"Perhaps you could... assist him, ma'am," the driver suggested delicately.

Exhaling sharply, Evelyn reached to support Dominic's neck.

The instant her fingers brushed his warm skin, his eyes flew open - dark, dangerous, and completely sober.

Evelyn jerked back as if burned, hastily taking another gulp of water.

Dominic's piercing gaze tracked her movements, recalling the divorce documents he'd seen on her laptop earlier.

How exactly did she plan to execute this little scheme of hers?

The car glided through the night, the atmosphere thickening with each passing mile.

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed under Dominic's unrelenting stare. She drained the bottle in record time.

With a sudden movement, Dominic snatched the empty bottle from her hands and hurled it across the car. The plastic cracked against the door.

"You want to divorce me because I made you terminate that bastard's child," he spat, voice dripping venom.

Cornered, Evelyn lifted her chin. "You have every right not to want children. But you don't get to strip me of my right to motherhood. If I want children, how else would I have them except through divorce?"

This issue was a jagged shard between them, destined to keep cutting unless resolved.

Dominic's eyes blazed. "Why this obsession with children? Do you find them so enchanting?"

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. If she weren't already carrying his twins, she might have conceded.

But now? "Why are you so opposed? You're not the one carrying them or raising them! Why deny them existence?" Her voice rose, surprising even herself.

The driver's grip tightened on the wheel. Since when did Evelyn Thorne dare shout at Dominic Blackwood?

Did she truly believe his patience was infinite?

Just as the driver expected violence, deafening silence descended.

Eventually, Evelyn wiped her damp palms on her dress. "Everyone has their boundaries. What's the point of fighting?"

"Don't flatter yourself, Evelyn Thorne," Dominic said icily. "You're hardly irreplaceable."

"We're night and day. I never expected to stand as your equal," she countered.

"Who's night? Who's day?" Dominic's cryptic question caught her off guard.

Evelyn pressed her temples, the alcohol fumes suddenly overwhelming. She cranked down the window, gulping the night air.
###Chapter 55

The crisp night air rushed into the vehicle, tangling Evelyn's dark locks as it soothed her frayed nerves.

Dominic's words echoed in her mind - he wasn't the only man meant for her.

That single statement gave her hope. If she stayed firm in her decision, perhaps he would eventually grant her the divorce she desperately wanted.

The tightness in her chest eased slightly at this comforting realization.

As they pulled up to Mooncrest Manor, Mrs. Wilkins and the chauffeur immediately moved to assist Dominic from the car.

Seeing him being cared for, Evelyn slipped away unnoticed to her own quarters.

She'd barely settled in when Mrs. Wilkins appeared at her door. "Mr. Blackwood refuses assistance from the staff, Miss Thorne. Perhaps you could try? He just needs his face wiped and help changing."

Wipe his face? Change his clothes?

Evelyn wouldn't have hesitated if Dominic were still in his coma, but now...

He might be intoxicated, but he was fully conscious.

Their heated exchange in the car remained fresh in her mind.

"Can't we just let him sleep as he is?" Evelyn suggested. "He can shower and change when he wakes."

Mrs. Wilkins gasped. "That simply won't do! Please, just come with me. He might be more agreeable if it's you."

The master bedroom door stood ajar when they arrived, revealing Dominic sprawled across the massive bed.

Mrs. Wilkins gently pushed Evelyn forward. "With this much alcohol, he might vomit during the night. Someone should watch over him."

Evelyn already knew where this was heading.

Before she could protest, Mrs. Wilkins continued, "This is a critical phase in his leg rehabilitation. Any injury now could set back his progress terribly. You must stay with him tonight!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, swallowing her objections.

The housekeeper had a point - she couldn't refuse.

"You can wait until he's deeper asleep to clean him up... If changing proves difficult, just remove his outer clothes... Let him rest like that..." Mrs. Wilkins retreated, closing the door behind her.

Evelyn felt her pulse quicken.

Approaching the bed cautiously, she studied Dominic's flushed face. His breathing was heavy, his cheeks unusually rosy from the alcohol.

After fetching warm water from the ensuite, she placed the basin on the nightstand and began unbuttoning his dress shirt.

The moment her fingers brushed the first button, his hand shot up, gripping her wrist with surprising strength. His eyes flew open, dark and alert.

"Release me," Evelyn demanded, meeting his gaze steadily. "Or undress yourself."

Dominic's head throbbed mercilessly. Though coherent, his limbs felt leaden with intoxication.

He relinquished his hold, allowing Evelyn to remove his shirt and unbuckle his belt.

But as her fingers moved to his trousers, his hand clamped down harder on her wrist.

"Who gave you permission to enter?" he growled, chest heaving. "Who said you could undress me? Have you no shame?"

Evelyn blinked in astonishment.

Was this the alcohol talking?

Chances were he wouldn't remember any of this tomorrow.

The realization emboldened her.

She shoved his hand aside, grasped his waistband, and tugged forcefully until the trousers came free.

Dominic's glare could have melted steel as he swore viciously.

Ignoring him, Evelyn tossed the clothes into the hamper, then wrung out the warm cloth to gently cleanse his furious face.
###Chapter 56

"Stop acting like a child," Evelyn murmured softly as she dabbed Dominic's face with a damp cloth. "Do you honestly think I enjoy playing nursemaid? You reek of alcohol... Weren't you the one who'd throw a fit over a single wrinkle in your sheets? Was all that perfectionism just for show?"

She sighed, adjusting the blanket around him. "I wouldn't even be here if it weren't for your injured leg."

Her voice, smooth as honey, seemed to soothe Dominic's restless movements. His breathing steadied, eyelids growing heavy under her care.

By the time Evelyn returned from freshening up, Dominic had succumbed to sleep. She exhaled deeply, tension leaving her shoulders as she perched on the edge of the bed.

Her gaze swept the lavish bedroom, memories surfacing of those first terrifying months when hidden cameras tracked her every move. The surveillance had stopped long ago—Dominic might be volatile, but he wasn't a voyeur.

Retrieving her pillow and blanket from the guest room, Evelyn settled beside him. Dominic stirred occasionally through the night, too intoxicated to register her presence. They slept undisturbed until dawn.

Golden sunlight spilled through the floor-to-ceiling windows, painting the room in warmth. Evelyn slept soundly, one arm draped across Dominic's chest, her leg entwined with his.

A pounding headache dragged Dominic to consciousness. He blinked, finding Evelyn's serene face inches from his own. Something unfamiliar tightened in his chest.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered open moments later. Their eyes locked, electricity crackling between them. Dominic's gaze, though still bloodshot, held sharp clarity now.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks as she realized their tangled limbs. Seeing his lack of reaction, she feigned nonchalance, slowly withdrawing her leg.

"You look rested," Dominic rasped, voice rough with sleep. Evelyn froze mid-retreat.

"I suppose," she mumbled, hastily disentangling herself. "You skipped showering last night. Shouldn't you...?"

The diversion worked. Dominic rose without comment, disappearing into the ensuite. The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn snatched her bedding and fled.

Safe in the hallway, she pressed a hand to her racing heart. Close call. At least nothing inappropriate had happened.

She prayed Dominic would forget everything—their car argument, the accidental intimacy. Otherwise, her already complicated situation might become unbearable.

Though part of her wondered if provoking him further might finally secure that elusive divorce...

Meanwhile across town, Sophie Mercer adjusted her wide-leg trousers as she waited outside the bistro. Her second meeting with Adrian Vaughn felt significantly more relaxed than their first encounter.

Dressed in a tailored jacket and sneakers, her hair in a simple ponytail, Sophie looked up as Adrian approached—mirroring her casual chic in a denim jacket and loafers.

Their smiles bloomed simultaneously.

"You were quite the seductress at that gala," Adrian teased, holding the door open. "I'd assumed that was your default setting."
###Chapter 57

Sophie clutched the leather-bound menu between her manicured fingers. She tilted her head at Adrian with a knowing smirk. "That fitted suit you're wearing? Couldn't help noticing how... tailored it was. Naturally assumed you swung that way." She waved a dismissive hand. "Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course."

Adrian nearly spat out his sparkling water.

"You've got me all wrong, Miss Mercer," he coughed, dabbing his lips with a napkin. "Straight as an arrow. Painfully straight."

"And contrary to popular belief," he added with a pointed look, "I don't sleep with everything that moves."

"Fine!" Adrian extended his palm across the table. "Clean slate?"

Sophie grasped his hand firmly. If playing nice would uncover his motives regarding Evelyn, she'd play the game.

After placing their orders, the conversation flowed surprisingly easily. By the time their appetizers arrived, Adrian had relaxed enough to let slip more than he intended.

"Know this guy," he began, swirling his cocktail, "got railroaded into marriage. Totally whipped now but won't admit it." He chuckled. "When his wife hit some trouble recently? Sent me in as cavalry. Hilarious part? She's clueless we're buddies." His grin widened. "First time we met? Dude lost his damn mind. Nearly tore my head off for meeting her alone... Ridiculous, right?"

Sophie's fork froze mid-air. "That's wild. My best friend just dropped a husband bomb on me too!" She leaned in conspiratorially. "Won't even tell me who the guy is because she's dead set on divorcing him. Though who knows if that'll happen."

"Modern relationships, am I right?" Adrian shrugged.

"Tell me about it," Sophie groaned. "This is exactly why I'm staying single."

"Preach," Adrian agreed, clinking his glass against hers.

Sophie saw her opening. Time to verify that suspicious two-hundred-million-dollar claim.

"You seem like a tech guy," she said casually, toying with her necklace. "Mobile payments or plastic?"

"Phone mostly," Adrian answered between bites. "Easier."

"Don't those have transaction limits?"

Adrian laughed. "Not like I'm buying yachts daily. Fresh out of college - can't exactly drain the family trust without guilt."

Sophie nodded, then went for the kill. "So... what's actually in your bank account?"

Adrian choked on his steak. "What, worried I can't afford dessert?" He wiped his mouth. "Truth? Barely six figures."

Sophie's lips pursed. She gave a polite nod, mind racing.

Who to believe? Adrian's transparent expression suggested honesty. But Evelyn was her ride-or-die.

Time for plan B.

"Family business keeping you busy?" she probed. Maybe the money belonged to his father. Was acquiring Thornfield Industries a family scheme?

Adrian snorted. "Dad's desperate to hand me the reins. Not my scene at all." His answer only deepened Sophie's confusion. She needed more, but pushing further would raise red flags.

Sophie unleashed her secret weapon - a slow, sultry smile. "So... what do you think of me?" She traced the rim of her wine glass. "If you're interested, I'm ready to take this somewhere... more exciting."

Adrian's fork clattered against his plate. "Isn't that moving a bit fast?"

Sophie's smile faltered just enough to make him panic.

"No! I mean—" Adrian backpedaled furiously. "We should get to know each other properly first—"

As his excuses piled up, Sophie's expression grew stormier.

"Okay! Sorry!" Adrian surrendered. "Just... pleasantly surprised you're this into me. If you're serious, then absolutely—"

"Call me Sophie," she purred, satisfaction curling her lips. Two weeks - that's all she needed to uncover his game.

Adrian looked dazed, like he'd won the lottery without buying a ticket.

This was happening too fast!

Since when did relationships materialize over one dinner?

When Evelyn heard about Sophie's new "boyfriend," her phone nearly slipped from her fingers.

This was next-level undercover work.

Her thumbs hovered over the keyboard when an unknown number flashed across her screen. Before she could react, her finger grazed the answer button.

A deep, unfamiliar voice filled her ear.
###Chapter 58

"Is this Miss Evelyn Thorne?"

The voice on the other end of the line was smooth, deep, and carried an effortless charm.

"Yes, speaking. And you are?" Evelyn replied, curiosity threading through her words.

"Hello, I'm Tristan Chamberlain from Veritas Capital. I obtained your contact from Thornfield Industries' HR department. I'd love to discuss a potential collaboration," Tristan said, his tone warm and inviting.

"Veritas Capital?"

"Indeed. Would you be available to meet today? I happen to be near your office at the moment," Tristan offered, his sincerity evident.

After a brief pause, Evelyn agreed.

Once they settled on a meeting spot, she immediately dialed the HR manager at Thornfield Industries.

"Do you know Tristan Chamberlain from Veritas Capital?"

"Absolutely. He's a brilliant investor. Veritas is one of the top investment firms in the country, which is why I didn't hesitate to share your number when he requested it earlier," the HR manager explained.

"Understood," Evelyn murmured.

"Would you like me to accompany you to the meeting? I worry it might be overwhelming if you go alone," the manager offered.

Morale at Thornfield Industries had plummeted since Vincent Holloway's departure, and several key employees had resigned. Without securing investors soon, the company would be in dire straits.

"That won’t be necessary. It’s the weekend—you should take some time for yourself," Evelyn replied firmly.

On her way to the meeting, she quickly searched Tristan Chamberlain online.

Her breath hitched when his photo appeared.

He looked far younger than she’d imagined.

A glance at his age confirmed he was indeed quite young.

Odd. They were the same age, yet Tristan seemed youthful, while Dominic Blackwood carried an air of maturity beyond his years.

She studied Tristan’s photo again and realized why.

Tristan’s confident, easy smile radiated warmth, whereas Dominic’s expression was perpetually unreadable.

When Evelyn stepped into Café Solstice, Tristan immediately stood and waved her over.

She took the seat across from him. "Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Chamberlain."

"Please, call me Tristan," he said with a disarming smile, sliding the menu toward her.

Evelyn hesitated, then shook her head. "I don’t drink coffee." She quickly added, "I’ve been having trouble sleeping, so my doctor advised cutting out caffeine."

Tristan set the menu down, concern flickering in his eyes. "My apologies—I had no idea. We can go somewhere else if you'd prefer?"

"It’s fine. Water will do," she assured him. "You mentioned a potential collaboration, Tristan. What interests you about Thornfield Industries?"

Tristan ordered a coffee and a slice of chocolate cake before turning his full attention back to her.

"From a business standpoint, I see immense potential in Thornfield," he said smoothly.

Evelyn studied him. "Are you referring to our Cerebra System?"

Tristan’s expression shifted, thoughtful. After a beat, he replied, "Your father intended to apply the system to private vehicles, but I believe we can aim higher. Imagine its applications in exploration, search and rescue, even military operations. Don’t you agree?"

Evelyn’s mind raced with possibilities.

"The private sector is too volatile," Tristan continued. "One fatal accident could destroy the company’s reputation overnight."

Evelyn nodded slowly. "That’s a compelling argument. What kind of collaboration did you have in mind?"

Tristan adjusted his glasses, a faint smile playing on his lips. "From what I’ve heard, someone is looking to acquire Thornfield Industries."

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her glass. "Yes," she admitted. "He wants to buy us outright."
###Chapter 59

"I've heard you're not looking to sell, so I won't waste time suggesting it," Tristan said.

He leaned forward, his gaze steady. "What I want is to become a shareholder."

Evelyn's eyes brightened instantly.

"You're serious about this, Mr. Chamberlain?" she asked, barely containing her surprise.

"Absolutely. But before we sign anything, there are two matters we need to discuss," Tristan replied, sliding a folder across the table. "This is a proposal my team drafted. Thornfield Industries won't survive if it continues on its current path. We're running a business, not a charity. Profit is the only thing that ensures longevity."

Evelyn flipped through the documents quickly, her fingers tracing the bold headings. "Can I take this back to discuss with my team?"

"Of course."

"Thank you," she murmured, lifting her glass of water for a sip.

Then she met his gaze squarely. "You mentioned a second matter?"

Before this meeting, she hadn't expected things to go so smoothly.

Now that the main point was settled, she felt lighter—until his next words.

"I'm Bianca Chamberlain's brother," Tristan said bluntly. "Half-brother, to be precise."

The moment the words left his mouth, Evelyn's composed expression shattered.

Bianca Chamberlain… Tristan Chamberlain…

No wonder he had seemed familiar.

He was Bianca's brother all along.

Evelyn and Bianca had never gotten along. And now, her brother wanted to invest in her company?

Was this some kind of joke?

She couldn't help but question Tristan's true motives.

"My relationship with Bianca isn't typical. Different mothers, and I was named heir to the family business," he explained.

"Are you telling me this because you know I don't get along with your sister?" Evelyn asked carefully. "Did she mention it?"

"She's obsessed with Dominic Blackwood. Given your history with him, I assumed she'd made things difficult for you—even if she never admitted it."

"Exactly. We despise each other. Which is why I need time to consider working with you," Evelyn said bluntly.

Tristan hadn't expected such a sharp reaction.

"Miss Thorne, as Thornfield Industries' leader, your priority should be your company's survival. Hundreds of employees depend on you. Your issues with Bianca don't concern me. Don't take them out on me—I'm innocent."

His tone was calm, almost soothing. It was hard to stay angry.

"I'm not a seasoned executive, Mr. Chamberlain. Things between Bianca and me aren't simple. As her brother, I have every right to be cautious about you," Evelyn countered.

"Think it over, then. I'll wait for your answer," Tristan said, his lips curving into a confident smile.

Evelyn nodded and stood to leave.

News of Veritas Capital's potential investment in Thornfield Industries spread like wildfire.

Dominic's expression darkened when he heard.

Tristan was a ruthless opportunist.

There was no way his intentions were pure.

Though they'd known each other for years, they were hardly close.

If not for Bianca, they would have lost contact long ago.

"Dominic, I called Thornfield Industries earlier. Evelyn met with Tristan Chamberlain today and agreed to a collaboration. If he invests a hundred and fifty million, she won't refuse—especially since he's only taking a passive role," Adrian reported.

Dominic's voice turned icy. "It sounds to me like he's trying to buy Evelyn, not the company."
###Chapter 60

"Is Evelyn truly worth that much?" Adrian asked, his eyebrows lifting in surprise.

"She's worth every penny because she's my wife," Dominic replied, his gaze turning frosty. "If she weren't married to me, Tristan Chamberlain wouldn't even glance in her direction."

Adrian's confusion deepened.

"If he wants to throw money at her, let him. Isn’t this just free cash for her?"

"She’s. My. Wife." Dominic bit out each word sharply.

"Oh… right. Got it." Adrian hesitated. "So what’s the plan? Raise our offer? Because if we don’t, she’ll definitely take Veritas Capital’s deal."

"Not necessarily."

"Then why are you so worked up?"

Adrian could hear the barely restrained frustration in Dominic’s voice.

Dominic had wanted to acquire Thornfield Industries to free Evelyn from its crushing debt and endless problems.

She was still in university—far too young and inexperienced to run a company.

Selling it would clear her debts, secure her future, and give her and her mother financial stability.

He had weighed every angle before making this decision, yet Evelyn refused to see his efforts.

If she accepted Tristan’s investment, Veritas Capital would inevitably seize control of Thornfield Industries.

"You’re lucky, Adrian. No one loves you, and you love no one. No heartbreak for you," Dominic muttered dryly.

"Actually, I got a girlfriend today!" Adrian grinned. "Blind date. Our families know each other, so it’s pretty much set in stone."

"Good for you. Introduce her to me once things settle," Dominic said flatly.

"Will do!" Adrian chuckled before adding, "But seriously, why don’t you just talk to Evelyn? She’s not clueless—she’s got a mind of her own."

"Go see your girlfriend," Dominic snapped.

Just hearing Evelyn’s name made his temples throb.

As if he didn’t already know how stubborn she was.

Her stubbornness was exactly why she never listened to a word he said.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat in a quiet café, venting to Sophie over the phone.

"Whether it’s Mr. X, Adrian Vaughn, or Tristan Chamberlain… something about them feels off," she mused. "Adrian acts broke one second, then flaunts wealth the next. And Tristan? He knows Bianca and I can’t stand each other, yet he’s suddenly desperate to invest in my father’s failing company. If Thornfield Industries was actually in demand, I wouldn’t question it—but no one else is interested!"

Sophie took a slow sip of her iced tea. "Let me handle Adrian. As for Tristan, why don’t you just call Bianca and ask what’s really going on?"

Evelyn stiffened.

She’d spoken too fast and let that slip.

"If you don’t trust Adrian, don’t work with him," Sophie continued, oblivious. "Otherwise, you’ll regret it when he backstabs you later. That guy’s sharp—you won’t outmaneuver him."

Thankfully, Sophie didn’t press further.

"I already know the board will push for Veritas Capital’s offer," Evelyn sighed.

"You’re the CEO! Who cares what they think?"

"Except I’m not technically the CEO. I never signed the contract!"

"With your VP gone, who’s left to challenge you? Just make the call yourself, Evelyn. Stop overthinking it—oh, Adrian’s here. Gotta go!"

When Evelyn returned to Blackwood Manor that evening, guests had gathered in the dining room.

"Miss Thorne! It’s the weekend—out with friends?" Lucas Grant stood from the couch, smiling. "Join us for dinner if you haven’t eaten yet!"

The sight of Lucas reminded Evelyn of Dominic’s drunken antics the other night.

"I’m not hungry," she lied. "I’ll eat later."

But just then, the rich aroma of roasted herbs and spices drifted from the kitchen.

Her stomach betrayed her with a loud growl.

Lucas laughed. "Come on, Miss Thorne! Sit with us." He guided her toward the dining area. "Heard you got an investor today, but you don’t look thrilled."

"Do you know Tristan Chamberlain?" Evelyn asked abruptly. "Bianca’s brother."

Since Lucas already knew about the offer, she might as well dig for answers.

###Chapter 61

"Of course I know Tristan! We were practically drinking buddies back in the day!" Lucas exclaimed, deliberately emphasizing his next words. "Did he happen to mention how incredibly close he is with Bianca?"

Evelyn's fork paused mid-air as surprise flickered across her features. "He told me they weren't particularly close."

Lucas leaned forward with a knowing smirk. "Then he lied to your face, darling. You should really ask yourself - why would Veritas Capital suddenly take interest in Thornfield Industries? What's the real game here?"

"You think this could be some sort of setup?" Evelyn's voice dropped to a whisper.

Dominic's best friend shook his head slowly. "I'm just saying there are always multiple angles to consider. Money doesn't magically appear from thin air, sweetheart. You just had that explosive confrontation with Bianca, and now her brother comes knocking with investment offers? Doesn't that strike you as... convenient?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her water glass. "It does now."

"Think it through carefully..." Lucas trailed off before calling out, "Dominic! Done interrogating your wife. You can come out now!"

Evelyn nearly spat out her water at the word "wife."

When they moved to the dining table, Dominic deliberately chose the seat farthest from her.

Lucas returned from the bar carrying a crystal decanter filled with amber liquid. "Care for some whiskey, Miss Thorne?" He set it down with three crystal tumblers.

"No thank you," Evelyn declined quickly. "I have thesis work to finish tonight."

"Suit yourself." Lucas poured generous measures for himself and Dominic. "Good thing you were there to handle him when he got plastered last week."

Evelyn coughed into her napkin. "I didn't handle anything. He slept it off just fine."

"At least he's a quiet drunk," Lucas mused. "Though he's never been good at expressing what's really going on in that complicated head of his-"

"Oh please!" Evelyn interrupted. "He expresses himself just fine - with temper tantrums worthy of a toddler! I've never met anyone more dramatic about their feelings."

Lucas's jaw dropped while Dominic's expression darkened like a thundercloud.

"Let's eat," Evelyn muttered, suddenly very interested in her salad.

She attacked her food with single-minded focus, stuffing her mouth to prevent any further verbal disasters. Within minutes, she pushed back her chair. "Excuse me."

As Evelyn fled, Lucas whistled low. "Does she always inhale her food like that?"

"Usually faster," Dominic deadpanned.

"Is she... you know, one of those girls with eating disorders? She barely touched anything."

"Anorexics don't eat at all."

"Right." Lucas smirked. "Maybe she's watching her figure for you."

Dominic's eyebrow arched. "You honestly think she gives a damn what I think?"

If Evelyn cared even slightly, she wouldn't have humiliated him at his own dinner table. The old him would've exploded, but lately he'd developed an alarming tolerance for her antics.

"Point taken," Lucas conceded. "But that unfiltered mouth of hers is exactly why you're obsessed with her."

"Who said anything about obsession?"

"Cut the crap, Dom. It's just us here." Lucas swirled his whiskey. "And can you blame yourself? Evelyn's sharper than most women in your circles."

"Sharp? All she thinks about is getting knocked up."

Lucas nearly choked on his drink.

Upstairs in the guest room, Evelyn booted up her laptop but couldn't focus. An uneasy feeling coiled in her stomach, the kind that usually preceded disaster.

When her phone buzzed, her pulse spiked. The caller ID made her blood run cold.

Victoria.

After everything that had happened, what fresh hell could her half-sister possibly want now?

###Chapter 62

Had they already squandered all the stolen funds? How could they possibly burn through such an enormous fortune so quickly?

Evelyn drew a sharp breath before answering the vibrating phone.

Before she could utter a word, Victoria's shrill voice pierced through the receiver. "Evelyn! Is the Cerebra System something my father developed with you? Hand it over immediately!"

Her voice cracked with terror, thick with unshed tears.

Something inside Evelyn shattered.

"How dare you call me, Victoria? Your uncle stole my father's money! Do you realize that's a federal offense? The authorities are already building a case against him!"

"What does that have to do with me? I didn't take a single cent! Just give me the Cerebra System! Tonight! You must deliver it tonight!" Victoria's hysteria escalated with each word.

Evelyn's forehead creased as chaotic background noises filtered through the line.

"Where exactly are you, Victoria?"

The response came between gut-wrenching sobs. "Help me, Evelyn! I'm at the Golden Phoenix Casino with Julian... They've taken him hostage... If you don't bring Dad's program, they'll sever his finger!"

"A casino? You're gambling?"

Evelyn's complexion drained of color.

She never suspected Julian had gambling tendencies!

"Stop interrogating me! Just bring the damn program and save him! Do you want Julian to become disabled? Don't you still care about him?" Victoria shrieked.

Evelyn had already grabbed her coat when Victoria's words froze her mid-step.

"Spare me the theatrics! Even if he were the last man on earth, I wouldn't spare Julian Whitmore a second glance! He got himself detained over gambling debts, didn't he? Why don't you bail him out? Your uncle embezzled hundreds of millions from my father - surely Julian's losses can't compare!"

She strode toward the bathroom, her mind reeling. Cold water might clear this fog of disbelief.

"My uncle never shared a penny with me!" Victoria wailed desperately. "They only want the program! You're the one who told everyone Julian had it! Why spread lies if you never intended to give it to him? This was your scheme all along, wasn't it?"

Evelyn hadn't anticipated Vincent moving this swiftly.

Though Julian was despicable, he remained Dominic Blackwood's nephew.

Vincent proved more merciless than she'd imagined!

"They're holding him over gambling debts, correct? Let me reconstruct this - someone inquired about the program, he falsely claimed ownership to secure credit, and now finds himself ensnared..."

The entire scenario crystallized in Evelyn's mind.

Had Julian not boasted about possessing the program, why would anyone extend him gambling funds?

Without gambling, how could this predicament have arisen?

This disaster was entirely of his own making!

"So you admit this was deliberate! You're utterly heartless, Evelyn Thorne! He treated you so well during your relationship! All his affection was wasted on you!" Victoria lashed out.

"Treated me well? While dating me, he was carrying on his sordid affair with you... They're merely taking a finger, not throwing him to piranhas. Save your dramatics for when it's actually warranted!" Evelyn retorted icily before terminating the call.

Her phone lit up again within sixty seconds.

This time, Julian's name flashed across the screen.

Evelyn's jaw tightened before she accepted the call.

She wouldn't soften, but hearing his desperate pleas held a certain appeal.

"Evelyn... Evelyn! Save me! If you don't... I'll be maimed for life! You never gave me the program... Never!"

Julian's voice trembled with raw panic as his captors restrained him.

"Why claim ownership of something you never possessed? You've reaped what you sowed, Julian Whitmore! I can't help you!" Evelyn moved to disconnect.

"Evelyn! It's my uncle! Uncle Dominic orchestrated this!" Julian suddenly screamed. "No one else would dare harm me! Please intercede with him... I'm begging you!"

Evelyn froze.

This wasn't Vincent's doing?

She suddenly recalled Dominic dispatching his security team to investigate her abduction in Ravenswood's outskirts.

###Chapter 63

Dominic knew everything Evelyn had said while strapped to the lie detector!

Was he truly the mastermind behind it all?

Did Dominic want to get his hands on Thornfield Industries' revolutionary new program?

A cold shiver ran down Evelyn's spine as the realization hit her. She ended the call with Julian and stepped out of her room.

Dominic and Lucas had finished dinner and were enjoying cigars in the grand living room.

Lucas immediately stubbed out his cigar when he noticed Evelyn approaching.

"Care to join us, Miss Thorne?"

Evelyn gave a curt nod and walked toward them.

Once she stood before them, she said, "I need to speak with Dominic alone."

Lucas blinked in surprise.

Was she dismissing him?

Flustered, he rose to his feet. "I'll take my leave then. You two should talk. Maybe take a stroll in the gardens—the night air is lovely."

He hurried out without another word.

Evelyn took Lucas' vacated seat. The image of Julian about to lose a finger steeled her resolve. "Julian just called. He's being held at a high-stakes poker table, and they're threatening to cut off his finger."

Dominic already knew.

His contacts at the casino had informed him.

Julian had been gambling recklessly all night.

"Does it upset you?"

Hearing Julian's name from Evelyn's lips sent a dark ripple through him.

"The men holding him believe he has Thornfield Industries' new system. They lent him money to gamble, and now they want the program as payment," Evelyn said, enunciating every word.

"You're among the few who knew he had it."

"Are you accusing me?"

Dominic's gaze turned glacial as ash drifted from his cigar.

"I'm just asking. If it wasn't you—"

"It was me," Dominic smirked, his voice dripping with malice. "Would you get on your knees and beg for him?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Over my dead body."

Dominic's entire body tensed.

"You think I won't give the order to take his finger?" he snarled.

"Go ahead."

Silence.

"He used to swear I was the only woman he'd ever love, yet tonight he's off doing God-knows-what with my sister. If you cut his finger off, I'll light your next cigar. How's that?" Evelyn challenged.

The darkness in Dominic's eyes turned arctic.

It seemed Evelyn no longer cared about Julian Whitmore.

After all, the man had nothing left to offer her.

Dominic's phone buzzed.

He glanced at the screen, then powered it off.

Moments later, Evelyn's phone rang. She checked the caller ID before shutting it down as well. The room was so quiet they could hear each other's measured breaths. After a long pause, Evelyn leaned forward.

"Don't play games with me, Dominic. If you do, I'll drag you down with me—and I won't let go."

###Chapter 64

Evelyn would never surrender what her father had bequeathed to her.

Not to anyone.

Not under any circumstances.

Her defiant words should have angered Dominic, but instead, they amused him.

"What's so funny?" Evelyn snapped when she noticed his smirk.

"You," he drawled, his voice dripping with mockery. "So self-righteous. So stubborn. So determined to destroy yourself." She could tolerate the first two insults, but the last one puzzled her.

"Get out of my sight! Just seeing you makes me sick."

Dominic's expression darkened instantly, his voice dropping to a dangerous growl.

"I didn't do anything. If you're feeling sick, maybe you should see a doctor," Evelyn retorted coolly. "Don't you have a personal physician? Shall I call him for you?"

"Get the hell out!" Dominic snarled through clenched teeth.

Evelyn stormed back to her room, her mood fouler than ever.

She slammed her laptop shut and collapsed onto the bed.

Her feelings for Julian had died long ago.

If not for Victoria's phone call, those buried memories would have remained forgotten, along with all the messy emotions now resurfacing.

The revelation about Julian's gambling addiction and subsequent danger left her with conflicting emotions.

Every cherished memory with him now felt tainted, even repulsive.

It was as if she'd been living in some twisted reality show, completely detached from the truth of her own life.

Exhausted by these turbulent thoughts, she finally drifted into an uneasy sleep.

At 2 a.m., headlights pierced the darkness as a car screeched to a halt outside the Blackwood estate.

Mrs. Wilkins was roused from sleep by the night guard and hurried to the grand foyer, where Eleanor stood fuming. "Bring Evelyn Thorne down here this instant!" Eleanor commanded before sinking onto a velvet sofa.

The housekeeper rushed to the guest suite.

Five minutes later, a bleary-eyed Evelyn entered the living room.

The palpable tension instantly snapped her awake.

"I always believed you were an innocent girl, but you've been deceiving me all along!" Eleanor's voice shook with rage. "You never mentioned dating Julian! Had I known, I would never have arranged your marriage to Dominic! This entire situation is absurd!"

"None of you bothered to ask about my past or consider my feelings," Evelyn countered calmly. "You treated me like a chess piece. If you're upset that your chosen pawn turned out to be flawed, you have only yourself to blame."

Eleanor sprang up and advanced on unsteady feet.

"Fine! Say I was wrong! But what excuse do you have for framing Julian tonight?"

"Framing him? You mean when he got himself into trouble through his own gambling?"

Eleanor momentarily faltered at Evelyn's sharp retort.

"You know perfectly well he wouldn't be in danger if he hadn't sought it himself. Instead of disciplining him, you're blaming me. This proves my mere existence in the Blackwood family is considered a crime."

Evelyn's eyes glistened as emotions overwhelmed her.

Eleanor could no longer contain her fury and delivered a stinging slap across Evelyn's face.

The sharp crack reverberated through the cavernous room.

Evelyn's cheek burned as hatred flared in her eyes. "Yes, I deliberately set Julian up. He betrayed me, and I wanted revenge," she declared with chilling clarity. "And as long as I remain married to Dominic, you can forget about ever having grandchildren."

Eleanor raised her hand again, but her strength failed, and she collapsed back onto the sofa.

Evelyn made no move to assist her, leaving Mrs. Wilkins to rush forward.

Dominic descended the staircase at that moment.

Clad in a charcoal silk robe, his expression was glacial. Evelyn couldn't bear to look at him - not even for a second.

###Chapter 65

Before Dominic could enter the living room, Evelyn swiftly retreated to her bedroom.

Eleanor Blackwood gasped for air, her chest tightening painfully, yet the mere sight of her son brought instant relief.

"Dominic...my darling boy..." Eleanor weakly extended her trembling hand toward him. Dominic rushed to her side and grasped it firmly.

"You must divorce Evelyn Thorne...tomorrow...file the papers..." Tears streamed down Eleanor's face as she spoke. "Forgive me...my son...I was blind...I chose such a tainted woman for you..."

Dominic gently wiped his mother's tears away with his thumb. "Stay out of matters between Evelyn and me, Mother. And cease concerning yourself with Julian."

"Julian lost a finger...the pain must be unbearable! He claims you did it, but I know that can't be true...you'd never harm family..." Eleanor's voice cracked with emotion.

"One more word about this nonsense," Dominic's expression darkened dangerously, "and I'll have the driver return you home immediately. I won't divorce Evelyn. Unless I choose to, no one can force me."

Eleanor drew a shuddering breath. "Have you fallen for her? For her...you'd betray your own nephew's entire family?"

Dominic released his mother's hand abruptly. Turning to the estate driver, he commanded, "Take my mother home."

Without another glance, he strode toward the staircase.

Eleanor watched her son's retreating figure, hot tears spilling uncontrollably.

How could he be so cruel?

This was all Evelyn Thorne's doing!

Her Dominic had never been this heartless before!

That woman's arrival had shattered the bond between uncle and nephew, causing this entire disaster.

Evelyn sat propped against her headboard, neck arched slightly backward.

Her cheek burned where Eleanor had struck her, but the deeper ache pulsed in her chest.

The bruise would fade in days, yet this heartache might never fully heal.

Even if she believed herself recovered, some future trigger could resurrect fragments of that terrible night.

At precisely 8:00 AM, Dominic sat at the breakfast table.

Suddenly, he turned to Mrs. Wilkins. "Summon Evelyn downstairs."

The housekeeper hurried to the guest suite but returned moments later, visibly flustered.

"Madam Evelyn isn't in her room. Perhaps she stepped out. Let me check with the gate," Mrs. Wilkins informed Dominic before rushing to the front courtyard. She reappeared shortly, wringing her hands. "Madam Evelyn departed around six this morning. Shall I attempt to call her?"

Concern gnawed at Mrs. Wilkins.

Eleanor's slap hadn't been gentle.

Though Evelyn appeared delicate, she possessed fierce pride.

The housekeeper dialed but only heard the mechanical drone of a disconnected line.

"Her phone's switched off," Mrs. Wilkins murmured.

Evelyn vanishing at dawn with her phone deactivated...

Surely she wouldn't do anything drastic over a slap?

Physical pain shouldn't drive one to desperation—yet emotions could override reason.

Dominic's expression hardened as crystal as he set down his coffee cup and exited wordlessly.

Pausing in the grand foyer, he extracted his phone and contacted his assistant.

"Nathan, locate Clara Thorne's contact information immediately."

"Right away, sir," Nathan responded. Upon obtaining the number, Dominic dialed without hesitation. "The number you have reached is currently unavailable. Please try your call again later."

What fresh hell was this? Both Evelyn and her mother had vanished into communication blackout?
###Chapter 66

Evelyn was lying on the examination table in a small county hospital, the cold gel on her belly making her shiver slightly. The ultrasound wand moved over her skin as the doctor studied the screen intently.

"The babies are growing perfectly," the doctor said with a warm smile. "Come back for your anomaly scan when you hit the five-month mark."

Evelyn exhaled in relief, her fingers curling into the paper sheet beneath her. "Thank you, Doctor."

"Don’t mention it," the doctor replied, handing her a printout of the ultrasound. "Your mother and I were close back in school. She told me the father isn’t involved, so you came all the way out here for privacy." The doctor hesitated, then added, "Evelyn, raising twins alone won’t be easy."

Evelyn took the scan, her lips curving into a determined smile. "I’ll manage."

"As long as you’re ready."

"I’ll call ahead next time," Evelyn said, sliding off the table and smoothing her shirt down. She stepped out of the room, where Clara was waiting anxiously.

"How are they?" Clara asked, immediately reaching for her daughter’s hand.

"Perfect," Evelyn murmured, stifling a yawn. "God, I’m exhausted."

She hadn’t slept at all the night before.

After slipping out of the Blackwood estate at dawn, she’d met Clara and endured a three-hour bus ride to this remote hospital. The bumpy roads had made her nauseous, but she’d forced herself to stay awake.

Now, with the confirmation that the babies were healthy, the weight on her shoulders lifted—just enough to let exhaustion take over.

"Should we get a room and rest before heading back?" Clara suggested, her eyes softening at Evelyn’s tired expression.

Evelyn shook her head. "It’ll take another three hours to get home. We should leave now."

"At least let’s eat first. You haven’t had anything all day." Clara tugged her toward the exit.

Evelyn’s stomach growled in agreement. "Fine, I am starving."

She pressed a hand to her lower belly, frowning slightly. "It feels different now. Not showing yet, but… firmer."

She guided Clara’s hand to the spot.

Clara chuckled. "Just wait until you’re further along. This is nothing compared to the third trimester." She sighed wistfully. "Four months already. Time flies."

Evelyn’s eyes flickered with both excitement and apprehension. "Soon, they’ll be here."

Clara hesitated before asking, "What about the divorce? Any progress?"

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. "Dominic is impossible. The more I push, the more he refuses. So I’ve stopped bringing it up."

"I’ve never even met him properly," Clara mused.

Evelyn scoffed. "Trust me, you’re not missing anything. He’s cold, arrogant—"

"He’s young, powerful, and used to getting his way," Clara interrupted gently. "You can’t judge him by normal standards."

Evelyn shot her a look. "Whose side are you on?"

Clara laughed awkwardly. "Let’s eat. Then we’ll go."

On the bus ride back, Evelyn dozed off with her head in Clara’s lap.

Clara stroked her hair absently, her fingers brushing against Evelyn’s left cheek—

Evelyn flinched in her sleep, murmuring, "Ow…"

Clara frowned, tilting her daughter’s face toward the light.

Evelyn had applied thick foundation, but up close, Clara could see the faint bruising beneath.

"Evelyn!" Clara gasped, shaking her awake. "What happened to your face?"

Evelyn blinked groggily. "Huh?"

Clara touched her cheek again, and Evelyn winced.

"Who hit you?" Clara demanded, her voice sharp. "Was it Dominic?"

Evelyn sighed. "No. I got into it with his mother last night." She rubbed her temple. "Honestly, I thought provoking her might make him finally sign the papers. Didn’t work."

"You idiot!" Clara hissed. "Don’t pick fights just to force a divorce!" She exhaled sharply. "Why didn’t you get this treated at the hospital?"

###Chapter 67

"I'm expecting, so I can't take any random medication," Evelyn murmured, pressing a hand to her stomach. "It'll pass in a few days. Some concealer should do the trick for now."

"You stubborn girl! At least get some proper rest!"

Clara fussed over her daughter, smoothing the blanket before urging her to lie down.

Evelyn shook her head with a tired smile. "I'm wide awake now. Maybe I'll just browse my phone for a bit."

As her screen lit up, the missed call notification from Mrs. Wilkins caught her eye. She considered returning the call but the noisy bus environment made her decide to wait until she got home.

Then a breaking news alert flashed across her screen:

'Julian Whitmore Carried Out of Monte Carlo Casino at 3AM! Alleged Massive Debt to Loan Sharks!'

Evelyn's breath hitched as she tapped the headline.

The accompanying photos showed two familiar faces - Julian being half-carried by security, and another shot of him being loaded into an ambulance. Standing beside him, dressed in a scandalously short dress that barely covered anything, was Victoria.

Even after all this time apart, her half-sister hadn't changed - if anything, she looked even more provocative than Evelyn remembered.

If not for Julian's gambling disaster, they'd probably be tangled up in some luxury hotel sheets right now.

With a sigh, Evelyn closed the news app and checked her messages.

A text from Sophie popped up: [OMG Evie! Almost slept with Adrian last night! Talk about bad timing - got my period RIGHT in the middle of things!]

Evelyn's eyes widened.

[You're moving faster than a Formula 1 car!] she typed back.

[We may have had one too many cocktails...] Sophie replied. [You should've seen his face when the crime scene happened! Total disappointment but get this - he actually went out to buy me tampons!]

[Don't luxury apartments keep those stocked?] Evelyn fired back.

[We were at his place...] Sophie admitted. [Okay fine, I agreed to date him to investigate his secrets, but a girl's gotta test the merchandise first, right?]

[Uh huh.] Evelyn replied dryly.

[Soooo... how's Mr. Blackwood in bed? ;)] came Sophie's next message.

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson. She quickly typed: [Phone's dying! Talk later!]

Sophie's immediate response: [THAT MEANS YOU DID IT! Otherwise you'd just say you don't know! HA!]

Mortified, Evelyn shoved her phone back into her purse just as the bus pulled into Ravenswood station.

After helping her mother with the groceries (Clara insisted on buying enough produce to feed a small army), Evelyn took the keys to unlock their apartment door.

The moment the door swung open, Evelyn froze.

Someone was sitting on their couch.

She stumbled back in shock, nearly colliding with Clara who gasped behind her. If not for having seen Dominic's photos in the news, she might have screamed for the police.

A broad-shouldered bodyguard stepped forward, ushering them inside before taking the grocery bags from Clara's arms with surprising gentleness.

"What are you doing here?" Evelyn demanded once she found her voice, striding toward Dominic. "This is my mother's home! You can't just—"

A chill ran down her spine. The realization hit her like a freight train - Dominic had not only tracked down her mother's address but walked in like he owned the place. Her entire life was an open book to this man.

Dominic studied her panicked expression before stating simply, "I came for you."
###Chapter 68

Dominic's words shattered the fragile defenses Evelyn had built around her heart.

She had stormed out of the mansion at dawn, turning off her phone completely. Unable to reach her, he'd tracked her down across town.

Was this concern? Genuine worry?

"You must be Dominic," Clara observed, sensing the tension thickening the air. "Evelyn had a rough night, so I brought her here to unwind. She's better now. Let me fix you some tea!"

"Mother!"

"That won't be necessary."

Their simultaneous responses made the atmosphere even more strained.

"He's just leaving, so don't trouble yourself. You should rest," Evelyn said firmly, guiding her mother back to the sofa.

The unspoken dismissal couldn't have been clearer.

Dominic rose with controlled grace.

"I'll take my leave. I'll visit properly another time," he stated coolly.

Clara moved to see him out, but Evelyn held her back. "I'm leaving too. Stay home and relax, Mother."

She followed Dominic out, the door clicking shut behind them.

Outside, she whirled to face him. "Don't ever come here again."

Dominic's expression hardened, his jaw tightening visibly. Patience stretched to its breaking point.

"Spare me your fake concern," Evelyn continued bitterly. "If you truly care, sign the divorce papers."

Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and walked away.

Dominic's glacial gaze burned into her retreating figure.

Physically mere feet apart, yet emotionally worlds away.

At St. Elizabeth Medical Center, Julian had undergone emergency surgery after being rushed in around midnight.

The surgeons said with proper preservation and an eight-hour window, reattachment of the severed finger stood a good chance.

Full functionality might never return, but at least he wouldn't lose it completely.

Julian didn't regain consciousness until mid-afternoon.

When his eyes finally fluttered open, they held a wild, haunted look - as if his very sanity had been stolen.

"Julian! You're safe now! You're in the hospital!" Beatrice soothed, clutching his uninjured hand. "Your father settled your debts."

Gregory's expression remained stormy. The astronomical sum he'd paid to the loan sharks sat like lead in his stomach.

He'd always known his son was worthless, but last night's losses defied belief.

Previous losses in the tens of thousands had been manageable. This time? Over eight million dors.

Of course, Gregory hadn't paid the full amount. With Julian's finger already taken as collateral, he'd negotiated the debt down to half.

###Chapter 69

"If you ever gamble again, I'll personally break every bone in your body!" Dominic Blackwood snarled, his voice dripping with venom.

"Why are you shouting at him? He just regained consciousness! There's no way he could've lost that much money alone—it must've been that little snake, Victoria Thorne!" Beatrice Thorne shrieked before storming out to summon Victoria.

Victoria entered the room, her gaze flickering to Julian Whitmore lying weakly on the hospital bed. Instantly, guilt weighed her down, and she lowered her head.

"Mom... Why are you blaming Victoria? Someone set me up last night! Otherwise, I wouldn't have lost that much!"

Julian's voice was frail, but his mind was sharper now.

"It was Uncle Dominic... No one else would do this! He found out I used to date Evelyn Thorne, and now he despises me!"

"I know it was your uncle! He doesn’t care about you or your father!" Beatrice wailed hysterically. "He's twisted—completely unhinged! We shouldn’t provoke him!"

Gregory Blackwood shoved his wife aside and barked, "Stop spouting nonsense in front of outsiders! Dominic and I don’t get along because of our age gap! If your son had any spine, Dominic wouldn’t be able to crush him like an insect! Look at yourselves—pathetic! Just seeing you makes me sick!"

With that, he turned on his heel and stormed out.

Beatrice burst into tears.

Julian clutched his head, pain throbbing behind his temples.

"Don’t cry, Mom! It's my fault! I'm worthless! You should’ve just let me die!"

"Julian, stop that!" Victoria grabbed his arm, her voice firm. "You might not be as ruthless as your uncle, but you're ten times the man he is in my eyes. Focus on recovering first. Then, we'll make him pay. Once he's gone, your father won’t compare you to him anymore."

Julian stilled.

Beatrice’s sobs ceased abruptly.

"Julian, you see Evelyn’s true colors now, don’t you? She’s on your uncle’s side. Forget her. We’ll eliminate them both. Once they’re gone, everything Dominic owns will be ours."

Victoria’s ambition blazed in her eyes.

Beatrice narrowed her gaze and stalked toward her. "What exactly do you bring to the table? I heard your mother siphoned a fortune from the Thorne family. Why didn’t she help with the loan sharks last night?"

Victoria pouted. "Mom is wealthy, but she’s launching a new venture overseas. Once it takes off, our net worth might surpass Dominic Blackwood’s! The international market is far more lucrative than here—"

"Spare me the excuses! The way you two gambled last night, you’d burn through any fortune!" Beatrice snapped.

"We won’t do it again! I swear!" Victoria raised her hands in surrender, eyes glistening. "We were just curious! It’ll never happen again!"

"Julian is this family’s last hope—Dominic will never have children," Beatrice muttered.

Victoria’s curiosity piqued. "Why not? Is there something wrong with him?"

"That’s none of your business! You’re not even my daughter-in-law yet," Beatrice hissed. "I’ll only forgive you if you prove useful to Julian from now on."

Victoria smirked. "Just wait. I’ll show you exactly what I’m capable of."

That evening, Bianca Chamberlain sat at an upscale restaurant, swirling a glass of red wine. Her appetite was nonexistent, her brows knitted in frustration.

"Have you lost your mind, Tristan? Giving that much money to Evelyn Thorne? If you’ve got money to burn, why not hand it all to me?"

Tristan Chamberlain chuckled, shaking his head. "I’d give you anything, Bianca, but you’re missing the point. This isn’t about money—it’s about revenge. Dominic Blackwood played with your heart. Now, I’m returning the favor."

Bianca scoffed. "You think you can mess with Evelyn Thorne? Dominic loves her. You really believe he’ll let you walk away unscathed?"

The absurdity of it all made her head spin.

"Stay out of this, Tristan. I don’t want you as Dominic’s enemy."

"We were never friends to begin with," Tristan said coolly. "I invested in Thornfield Industries because it’s undervalued. Once I take control, I’ll turn it around completely."

Bianca glared. "Evelyn Thorne is my nemesis. Are you trying to infuriate me by making her richer?"

"Look at it this way—what if she falls for me instead?" Tristan smirked.

Bianca rolled her eyes. "And if she doesn’t? Don’t get me wrong—you’re exceptional. But Dominic... there’s something about him. His dominance, his indifference, his self-restraint—"

"Do you know how his father died?" Tristan interrupted, swirling his wine. His voice dropped to a whisper.

"Dominic killed him."

###Chapter 70

The admiration on Bianca’s face vanished in an instant.

“I can’t be completely certain, but I’m at least eighty to ninety percent sure,” Tristan continued, his tone casual. “I never mentioned it before because we were on decent terms. Besides, I figured his achievements might make up for it.”

A cold shiver ran down Bianca’s spine. It took her a moment to steady her trembling hand enough to lift her wine glass to her lips.

“He’s impressive, no doubt, but he has a major flaw. You shouldn’t idolize someone like him. If you married him, I’d fear for your safety,” Tristan remarked coolly as he sliced into his steak.

“He must have had a reason… I refuse to believe he’s a bad person,” Bianca murmured after a long pause. “I’ve spent years by his side—I know him better than anyone.”

Tristan chuckled at his sister’s naivety.

“Remember that serial killer caught last year? He evaded justice for over a decade. All his coworkers swore he was the kindest, most hardworking man they knew.”

“Enough, Tristan Chamberlain!” Bianca snapped. “I can form my own opinions. Stay out of it!”

“I knew you’d react like this—that’s exactly why I kept quiet all these years,” Tristan said with an innocent shrug. “Fine, cling to your illusions. When you finally wake up, the family will welcome you back with open arms.”

“I don’t need your charity. I have my own assets.”

“Ah, so Dominic Blackwood pays you well,” Tristan teased.

As the Chamberlain heir, Tristan had never needed to worry about money, but Bianca had built her own fortune after leaving home.

“Regardless of anything else, he’s an incredible boss. Even if he’ll never be mine, I’ll stay by his side,” Bianca declared before raising her glass. “Good luck pursuing Evelyn Thorne. You’ve never failed before—let’s see if that streak holds.”

“It will,” Tristan said smugly, clinking his glass against hers.

A week later, Lucas strode into Dominic’s office at Blackwood Group, eager to share the latest gossip about Veritas Capital.

“So, Tristan Chamberlain is interested in investing in Thornfield Industries, right? Rumor has it Evelyn hasn’t given him a definitive answer yet,” Lucas said with a grin. “And apparently, he’s been relentless—dinner invitations, hiking trips, even an art gallery visit. He’s pulling out all the stops, but Evelyn’s been brushing him off.”

“Mr. Chamberlain’s finally met his match!” Nathan chimed in. “The man’s a professional charmer. Every ex still adores him. Who would’ve thought Miss Thorne would be immune?”

Dominic’s expression darkened. He didn’t find this amusing in the slightest.

The idea of Tristan Chamberlain pursuing his wife under the guise of “business” was infuriating—disrespectful, shameless, and utterly unacceptable.

“She hasn’t left the house in a week,” Dominic said tersely. “Her face was injured.”

Lucas and Nathan exchanged startled glances.

“How did that happen?”

After a tense pause, Dominic muttered, “My mother struck her.”

“What? Because of the situation with Julian?”

“Yes.” Dominic set his coffee down, his jaw tight. “She hasn’t spoken to me since.”

“Did you at least try to comfort her afterward?” Lucas pressed.

Dominic shook his head.

“No gifts? No apologies?” Nathan added.

Another silent denial.

Both men exhaled sharply.

No wonder Evelyn had been ignoring him.

“She wants a divorce,” Dominic said bitterly. “If I ask what she needs, she’ll say divorce papers. If I try to make amends, she’ll accuse me of faking concern.”

He was paralyzed—every move he made only pushed her further away.

Lucas and Nathan exchanged a sympathetic look.

Dominic outshone Tristan Chamberlain in every way, yet his love life was a disaster.

Experience mattered. Some things only got easier with practice.

###Chapter 71

The first hurdle was getting past the initial obstacle. Only then would the path ahead become clearer.

"Then don’t ask her—just buy her something," Lucas suggested. "Jewelry. Every woman loves jewelry."

"She doesn’t. I’ve never seen her wear any," Dominic replied flatly.

"What about skincare? All women use that, right?" Nathan chimed in.

"She doesn’t. When I checked her room, all I found was a single cleanser." He couldn’t possibly gift her something as mundane as a face wash, could he?

Lucas hadn’t expected Evelyn to be so unlike any other woman he’d encountered.

What shocked him even more was that Dominic Blackwood, the formidable CEO of Blackwood Group, had actually sneaked into a woman’s bedroom just to observe such trivial details.

"Then buy her that cleanser!" Lucas said, exasperated.

"It was covered in dust. Clearly, she doesn’t use it much," Dominic countered.

Lucas and Nathan exchanged glances, at a loss.

"Clothes, shoes, bags! She obviously wears those. She must carry a bag, right?" Lucas threw out more ideas. "After what your mother did, she’s probably heartbroken. She won’t even look at you unless you make a grand gesture."

"Actually, I think Miss Thorne is different," Nathan mused. "She’s still in university—material things might not impress her."

Lucas snapped his fingers as an idea struck. "Gifts might help, but what really matters is physical initiative."

"Meaning?" Dominic’s brow furrowed.

"Hugs? Kisses?" Nathan offered hesitantly.

"Exactly!" Lucas grinned.

Dominic’s expression darkened instantly.

Seeing his reaction, Lucas backpedaled. "We can help—if you’re not comfortable doing it yourself!"

"You want to hug and kiss her?!" Dominic’s voice was dangerously low.

Lucas choked. "I meant we could help pick out gifts! The rest is on you."

"Forget it," Dominic said coldly. He wasn’t about to rely on others for his love life. "It’s not like she’s the only woman in the world."

"Then why did you sneak into her room to inspect a dusty cleanser?" Lucas teased.

"Enough, Lucas. Give the boss some dignity," Nathan muttered, dragging him toward the door.

"Nathan," Dominic called as they left. "Set up a meeting with Tristan Chamberlain."

"Yes, sir. When?"

"Tonight."

"Understood."

That evening, Evelyn stepped outside for the first time in days.

A week cooped up indoors had left her restless.

The bruise on her cheek had worsened after she’d covered it with makeup for her checkup.

Without proper care, the healing process had been slow.

Even now, though faded, a faint purplish mark remained visible under close scrutiny.

Evelyn adjusted her face mask and walked beyond the neighborhood gates.

She’d barely taken ten steps when a motorcycle roared past.

By the time she registered the movement, her phone was already gone.

###Chapter 72

Evelyn's breath hitched as she stood frozen on the sidewalk.

The moment she registered her phone being ripped from her grasp, instinct propelled her forward in pursuit of the fleeing thief.

But after three strides, her hands flew protectively to her abdomen. The reality of her pregnancy stopped her cold.

With reluctant steps, she turned back toward the manor.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Wilkins was dialing Dominic with trembling fingers.

"Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Thorne had her phone stolen during her evening walk. We filed a report at the precinct, but they said recovery was unlikely." The housekeeper's voice dropped to a whisper. "She's been distraught - says it contained irreplaceable data. She's locked herself in the west wing bedroom, crying uncontrollably."

This was a calculated exaggeration. Mrs. Wilkins hadn't actually seen Evelyn's tears, but she knew exactly which buttons to push.

Across town, Dominic was seated at Villa Serenade awaiting Tristan Chamberlain's arrival for their scheduled negotiation.

The call ended after forty-seven seconds. By the forty-ninth second, Dominic's decision was made.

When Tristan arrived, he found only Nathan Cross waiting at the reserved table.

"Where's your illustrious boss?" Tristan's eyebrow arched with amusement.

"My apologies, Mr. Chamberlain. An urgent family matter required Mr. Blackwood's immediate attention," Nathan offered smoothly. "He's asked me to convey his regrets."

"How convenient." Tristan's laugh held an edge. "Tell me, does the great Dominic Blackwood often send underlings to do his dirty work?"

Nathan's smile never wavered. "If Mr. Blackwood wished to avoid you, he wouldn't resort to subterfuge. He fears no one."

Tristan settled into his chair, studying Nathan like a chess opponent. "Last I checked, family wasn't exactly Dominic's priority. Who merits such dramatic intervention?"

"His wife." Nathan's simple answer silenced further questions.

"I presume this meeting concerned Miss Evelyn Thorne." Nathan continued carefully. "Forgive my forwardness, but Mr. Blackwood is... particularly attached to her. For your own sake, I'd recommend maintaining distance."

Tristan's fingers drummed the tablecloth. "Ever considered switching allegiances, Nathan? I could triple your current compensation."

Nathan's composure slipped for a heartbeat.

"Your offer is generous, Mr. Chamberlain, but I have no intention of leaving Blackwood Group. Unless dismissed, I'll remain at Mr. Blackwood's side."

"Why?" Genuine curiosity colored Tristan's question.

"You might ask Bianca why she stays."

"Because she's hopelessly in love with him. Don't tell me you are too?" Tristan's chuckle was rich with amusement.

"Not romantically." Nathan's gaze turned thoughtful. "People fixate on his temper, but every diamond has multiple facets. The man who never smiles may have the purest heart, while constant charm often masks darkness."

"Are you implying something about me?" Tristan's eyes narrowed.

"Of course not." Nathan met his gaze squarely. "You're a formidable opponent, but my loyalty isn't for sale."

Nathan understood Tristan's game perfectly - acquiring insider knowledge by poaching Dominic's most trusted aide.

"Betrayal is a habit," Nathan added. "If I turned on Mr. Blackwood today, how could you ever trust me?"

Meanwhile, Dominic's arrival at the 12th Precinct sent officers scrambling.

The precinct captain appeared within ninety seconds, buttoning his uniform jacket hastily.

"A stolen phone? That thief must have a death wish!" The captain thumped his chest. "We'll have it back within twenty-four hours, guaranteed!"

"Not mine." Dominic's voice was ice.

The captain visibly relaxed. "Oh thank God, I thought—"

"My wife's." Dominic took a measured sip of water. "Can you still guarantee twenty-four hours?"

The captain's Adam's apple bobbed. "Absolutely! Our surveillance network is comprehensive. We'll initiate a citywide search immediately!"

Dominic gave a single nod. "I'd appreciate that."

"Just doing our job, sir!" The captain flipped open the incident report. "Your wife's name is... Evelyn Thorne?"

###Chapter 73

"That's her," Dominic answered sharply.

"Understood! I won't forget her face!" the police captain replied immediately.

Back at the Blackwood estate, Evelyn sat frozen at her vanity, fingers hovering over her laptop keyboard after posting about her stolen phone on social media.

Her mind swirled with dread.

Maybe it would be better if the thief just factory reset the device and pawned it off.

The thought of some stranger scrolling through her personal photos, reading private messages—it made her physically ill.

She pressed trembling fingers to her temples, exhaling shakily.

If only she'd stayed within the gated community for her evening walk.

The private gardens would've been perfectly fine!

Evelyn pushed away from the desk and stumbled into the ensuite bathroom.

The scalding shower did little to calm her nerves. When she finally collapsed into bed, sleep refused to come.

Just as her eyelids grew heavy, frantic knocking shattered the silence.

"Madam Evelyn? Are you awake?" Mrs. Wilkins' voice carried through the oak door. "Mr. Blackwood just called—they recovered your phone! You'll need to sign release papers at the precinct. He offered to handle it if you'd prefer."

Evelyn nearly tripped over the duvet in her haste.

"They found it?"

"Indeed! And might I add, only because Master Dominic intervened," the housekeeper emphasized carefully. "I took the liberty of informing him earlier. You're not cross with me, are you?"

Evelyn shook her head violently.

How could she be angry when her private life might still be salvageable?

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn stood trembling in the police station lobby.

The moment she spotted Dominic casually flipping her phone between his fingers, ice flooded her veins.

"Give that to me!" she snarled, launching herself at him.

Dominic raised the device effortlessly above her reach, his smirk turning dangerous.

"Someone's defensive. What exactly are you terrified I'll find?"

"Did you look?" Evelyn's vision blurred with unshed tears. "Do you get off on violating my privacy? I'm not one of your business acquisitions to paw through whenever you please!"

The entire precinct froze.

Every officer had witnessed Dominic's relentless pressure to recover the phone within hours.

And now this ungrateful woman was screaming at Aryadelle's most feared tycoon?

The handcuffed thief suddenly snorted. "Relax lady, it's just a bunch of baby bump selfies!"

Evelyn's blood turned to acid.

Those private photos—documenting every subtle change as her body nurtured new life—now laid bare for strangers to mock.

Dominic's expression shifted to something unreadable as his gaze dropped to her flat stomach.

###Chapter 74

Tears burned behind Evelyn's eyelids as she spun on her heel and marched out of the police station. She refused to sign the release papers. She didn’t even take her phone back from Dominic.

Dominic signed the documents himself and left shortly after. In the car, he silently handed her phone to her, his voice low. "I didn’t go through it."

Evelyn snatched it back, her breath uneven. "But you already know what’s in there."

"Are they important? Those photos…"

She clenched her jaw, forcing herself not to snap at him. After all, he was the one who had retrieved her phone. Her fingers tightened around the device as she asked, "What if I told you the baby you forced me to abort wasn’t Julian’s… but yours? Would you feel even a shred of guilt?"

Dominic turned his head sharply, his gaze piercing.

Evelyn’s expression was deadly serious.

His throat worked before he answered, voice rough. "From the IVF?"

"Yes," she said, holding his stare. "You killed your own child with your own hands. Do you feel anything at all?"

She searched his face, desperate for even a flicker of remorse—anything to prove he wasn’t completely heartless.

She needed to believe he was human.

But his expression only darkened. He knew his words would wound her, yet he said them anyway, cold and detached. "No. It was never meant to exist."

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. "Would you be so calm if your own parents had said that about you?"

"I’d thank them," he replied flatly. "Not everyone wants to be born, Evelyn."

Her brows lifted.

He didn’t want to exist?

How?

Dominic’s mother adored him. He had wealth, power, people who worshipped him.

Why such bitterness?

What had happened to him?

"Are you depressed?" she asked, unable to stop herself from slipping into clinical analysis. "There are treatments. If you’re ill, you should see a doctor."

For a fraction of a second, something flickered in his eyes.

Then his lips curled into a sardonic smile. "If pretending I’m sick makes you care, then by all means—treat me like a patient."

They arrived at the mansion close to midnight.

Exhausted, Evelyn collapsed into bed, too drained to think. Sleep claimed her almost instantly.

That night, she dreamed.

She dreamed of Dominic—young and vulnerable.

Of a father with a belt in hand, fury in his eyes.

Of a boy who screamed until his voice broke.

She woke with a gasp, heart pounding.

Dawn light seeped through the curtains.

Sitting up, she whispered to herself, "No. His mother would never have allowed that. Dreams aren’t real."

But deep down, she knew.

Something dark had shaped him.

Something that made him hate the world.

Hate life itself.

Her anger toward him softened, just a little.

He wasn’t the villain.

Neither was she.

Fate had simply woven them together in the cruelest way possible.

###Chapter 75

The morning sun streamed through the dining room windows as Evelyn sat across from Dominic at breakfast. The silence between them was thick enough to cut with a butter knife. She picked at her scrambled eggs while he methodically ate his cereal.

"Thanks for retrieving my phone last night," Evelyn finally broke the silence, her voice barely above a whisper.

Dominic's jaw tightened before he spoke. "I should apologize for my mother's behavior." His deep voice carried an unfamiliar note of remorse.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed pink. "You didn't slap me. Why are you apologizing?"

"No one should ever lay hands on you," Dominic said stiffly, his fingers tightening around his milk glass. "If anyone dared touch your face—"

Before he could finish, Evelyn reached across the table. Her fingertips brushed against his clean-shaven cheek, the contact sending an electric current up her arm. His skin was unexpectedly soft beneath her touch.

Dominic froze, his dark eyes burning with intensity. She watched his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed hard, the glass trembling slightly in his grasp.

"There. Now we're even," Evelyn murmured, withdrawing her hand quickly. She focused on her teacup, willing her racing heartbeat to slow. The fingers that had touched him still tingled strangely.

Finishing her breakfast in record time, she retreated to her bedroom.

The bruise on her cheek had faded to a faint yellow, easily concealed with light makeup. After a week cooped up in the mansion, Evelyn couldn't postpone work any longer. Thornfield Industries had been calling daily, and Veritas Capital kept sending urgent inquiries.

When she emerged dressed for the office, Dominic had already left.

"Shall I call the car for you, Mrs. Blackwood?" Mrs. Wilkins asked, already reaching for the house phone.

Evelyn was waiting by the grand entrance when her phone buzzed.

"Miss Thorne, do you have time today?" Lucas Grant's cheerful voice came through the speaker. "I need a favor."

"What kind of favor?" Evelyn frowned at the unexpected request. "I'm not sure how I can help."

"Trust me, you're perfect for this," Lucas insisted. "Are you home? I'll swing by and explain in person."

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn slid into the passenger seat of a white luxury sedan - identical to Dominic's except for the color.

"No office for you today, Mr. Grant?" she asked, buckling her seatbelt.

Lucas flashed a roguish grin. "Perks of being CFO. We need your expertise for a special project."

"'We'?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

"The executive team. Dominic's birthday is coming up," Lucas explained as he merged onto the highway. "We're hopeless at gift ideas. That's where you come in."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "When exactly is his birthday?"

Lucas burst out laughing. "You really don't know? Poor Dominic. Bianca would kill to have this information."

Heat flooded Evelyn's face. "I've been... preoccupied."

"Between Thornfield's troubles and your thesis, I'm sure you're busier than Dominic himself," Lucas teased good-naturedly. "But seriously, you must know what he likes."

Evelyn bit her lip. "I'm afraid I'll be useless here."

"Nonsense," Lucas said as they pulled into the city's most exclusive shopping district. "Since he's never accepted gifts from us before, we figured you could accept on his behalf."

The department store's jewelry section glittered under spotlights. Evelyn hesitated. "Jewelry? I've never seen him wear any..."

Lucas shrugged. "First time for everything."

###Chapter 76

If Lucas had brought this up when he first arrived at the mansion, Evelyn would never have stepped into his car.

"Mr. Grant, I understand all of you want to stay in Dominic's good graces—" Evelyn started to say.

"What are you implying? Haven't you ever exchanged gifts with friends?" Lucas cut in with an amused smile. "He always remembers our birthdays."

"So you'd ignore his request just because he told you not to give him anything? That proves you see him as nothing more than your employer," Evelyn countered sharply. "I won't be dragged into this. If I accept gifts on his behalf, it's no different from taking them directly from him. And then how could I ever scold him properly when he annoys me?"

Lucas blinked in astonishment.

Take pleasure in reprimanding him? Just what kind of daily interactions did Dominic and Evelyn have?

For the first time, Lucas wondered if his formidable boss might have some hidden masochistic tendencies.

"You'll have to find another solution. I'm leaving," Evelyn declared, turning on her heel.

Lucas quickly caught her wrist. "Miss Thorne, this birthday is special for Dominic," he said, his voice dropping into a practiced, somber tone.

His sudden shift in demeanor made Evelyn pause.

"It was right after his last birthday that the accident happened," Lucas continued, his eyes downcast. "The doctors gave him weeks to live at most... None of us believed he'd wake up. If he hadn't..." His voice cracked convincingly. "He wouldn't be celebrating this year at all."

Evelyn's resistance melted like spring snow.

She imagined herself in that hospital bed, the pain of recovery, the uncertainty. How could she deny someone this small comfort?

"Fine," she relented. "But nothing extravagant. I won't accept anything too expensive."

Lucas beamed, gesturing toward the jewelry displays. "Everything here is overpriced anyway. Let's go somewhere more reasonable."

Thus began the most bewildering shopping spree of Evelyn's life.

"Miss Thorne, your skin is flawless! Have you tried this new skincare line? The serum works miracles!"

Lucas moved through the department store like a seasoned stylist.

"Look at these delicate wrists! A thin bracelet would accentuate them perfectly. And it's practically a steal at this price!"

He whisked her from counter to counter with terrifying enthusiasm.

"Classic handbags never go out of style, and this one fits everything but the kitchen sink! Functional yet fashionable!"

By noon, Evelyn's feet ached. She spotted a café and collapsed into a chair, refusing to take another step.

"Order anything you like," Lucas said, sliding a menu toward her as if they hadn't just spent hours acquiring half the mall.

Evelyn massaged her temples. "Never involve me in something like this again, Mr. Grant. This is a one-time exception."

The mountain of shopping bags beside them—at least thirty—testified to Lucas's persistence.

A nagging unease settled in Evelyn's stomach. She shouldn't have caved so easily.

Yet when she pictured Dominic now, his usual arrogant smirk seemed slightly less irritating.

The realization gave her a headache.

Lucas took a casual sip of water. "Of course. Thank you for today." Then, as if struck by sudden curiosity: "You haven't responded to Tristan Chamberlain yet, have you?"

"Not yet," Evelyn admitted. "He sent a revised proposal last night. I haven't had time to review it."

Lucas's eyes gleamed. "He's certainly pulling out all the stops to work with you."

###Chapter 77

Evelyn was lost in thought when a sudden realization struck her.

"Did Dominic have anything to do with what happened to Julian Whitmore?" she asked.

Lucas was stunned.

"Why would you think that? Didn't Julian get himself into trouble with his gambling debts? What does that have to do with Dominic?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of water before answering. "He admitted it was his doing. He even told me to get on my knees and beg."

Lucas was speechless.

He picked up his own glass and drank, then sighed. "What is going on between you two? What kind of couple constantly picks fights like this? It's like you both enjoy it!"

Evelyn immediately denied it.

"I don't have such a strange habit. He's the one who keeps provoking me."

"Exactly! And I'm sure he'd say the same about you!"

"Which is exactly why we don't get along," Evelyn muttered, taking another sip. "Some couples argue and fall deeper in love. Others just break up."

She hesitated before adding, "Don't you think Bianca Chamberlain is a better match for him? In ten years, they've never had a single problem."

Lucas scoffed. "That's because there was never anything between them. Dominic feels nothing for Bianca."

Evelyn exhaled. "Right... I almost forgot."

The woman he truly loved was the one who looked like a princess.

After lunch, Evelyn took a cab to Thornfield Industries.

Lucas sent the day's purchases back to the Whitmore mansion before heading to Blackwood Group.

Of course, he didn't miss the chance to gloat in front of Dominic.

"I bought her thirty-one gifts this morning," Lucas announced. "She was thrilled."

Dominic glanced up, unimpressed. "Did you force her to accept them?"

Lucas smirked. "Could you tell?"

Dominic arched a brow, silently waiting for the explanation.

"When I asked her to pick a bracelet, she stared at one for more than three seconds. I went back and bought it after she left."

He pulled out a velvet jewelry box and opened it, revealing a delicate diamond bracelet.

The stones were modest, making it tasteful rather than extravagant.

"Give it to her tonight," Lucas said, handing it over.

Dominic turned the box between his fingers, his sharp gaze fixed on Lucas. "How did you convince her to take the gifts?"

Lucas grinned. "I told her it was an early birthday present—since your first one after the accident is coming up—"

Dominic's expression darkened. "My birthday is months away!"

"I was just helping you cheer her up," Lucas defended. "She might not have shown it, but she was happy."

"You're useless," Dominic muttered.

Lucas wisely stayed silent.

"Give me the receipts," Dominic demanded.

"Don't worry about it. Consider it my birthday gift to you."

"Give. Me. The. Receipts."

That evening, Evelyn returned home.

"Madam, I've placed all your purchases in your room," Mrs. Wilkins informed her.

Evelyn's cheeks warmed. "Thank you... Is Dominic back yet?"

"He returned around four."

Her pulse quickened. "I'll come down after he's had dinner. I'm going to my room first."

Once inside, she began unpacking the gifts.

Her fingers brushed against a small red box she didn't recognize.

"We didn't buy this today," she murmured, opening it.

Inside was the very bracelet she had admired at the jewelry store.

###Chapter 78

Evelyn was absolutely sure they hadn't purchased this necklace earlier that day.

Yet here it was, gleaming on her dresser as if by magic.

Stepping into the hallway, she collided with Dominic descending the staircase.

Swallowing her unease, she gestured toward her room. "Care to explain the sudden appearance of jewelry?"

Though he appeared uninvolved, every fiber of her being screamed this was his doing.

Lucas must have told him everything.

Dominic's jaw tightened visibly. "Lucas acquired it."

A weighted pause. "When I saw the price tag, it was practically being given away. No serious buyer would touch it, so..."

His voice trailed off meaningfully.

Evelyn's mind raced through polite refusal strategies until his next words derailed her completely.

He'd brought it home precisely because it was worthless to others.

Perfect.

If that's how he wanted to play it, she'd keep the damn thing without guilt.

"Join me for dinner," Dominic commanded.

Her mouth opened to decline, but her traitorous feet carried her toward the dining room anyway.

Perhaps accepting gifts came with unspoken obligations.

The crystal chandelier cast prismatic patterns across the linen tablecloth as they settled in.

Mrs. Wilkins served roasted duck with black truffle before discreetly vanishing.

Evelyn pushed brussels sprouts across her plate with surgical precision.

Dominic never initiated meals without purpose. What game was he playing now?

And those extravagant gifts - he must have authorized every purchase personally.

Her fork hovered midair, meat forgotten as possibilities swarmed her mind.

"Problem with your food?" Dominic's voice sliced through her reverie. "Or has Tristan Chamberlain been in contact?"

She forced a bite. "How well do you actually know him?"

"University days." His fingers drummed the tablecloth. Then, completely deadpan: "Would you like to see his dating history?"

Evelyn's wine went down the wrong pipe.

Coughing violently, she reached for water as Dominic produced a manila folder with magician's flair.

Her eyes darted between the file and his impassive face.

This behavior bordered on pathological.

Her dealings with Tristan were strictly professional. Why this sudden interest in his romantic past?

And to physically print dossiers like some jealous...

Dominic misinterpreted her stunned silence. "You're aware he's courting you?"

Her silverware clattered against china. "He knows I'm married. To you."

"Divorces happen. Affairs occur." His gaze turned forensic. "Your shock confirms you hadn't noticed."

"I see." She flipped through pages glossy with model headshots. "Good lord, they're all walking Victoria's Secret ads. Look at these measurements! And those pillowy lips made for..." She caught his darkening expression. "This is precisely what thrills men like you, isn't it?"

Dominic's knife screeched against porcelain.

He'd intended this as a warning about Tristan's true motives, not some bizarre beauty pageant critique.

"If I'm so clearly not his type," Evelyn tapped a manicured nail against a bikini photo, "why the sudden interest?" The answer struck like lightning. "Ah. Sisterly vengeance?"

"Occasionally, you exceed my expectations," Dominic drawled.

She rolled her eyes. "Won't this damage your precious network? You'd declare war over a misplaced paperclip."

"We ceased being associates years ago." His voice carried winter's bite.

"Noted." She resumed eating with forced nonchalance. "So what exactly do you require from me?"

He needed verbal confirmation.

"The board meeting today," she said between bites. "Every executive voted to proceed with Veritas Capital."

###Chapter 79

"You have every right to refuse," Dominic murmured, his voice low and measured.

"Just eat your damn food!" Evelyn shot back, her temper flaring. "Even if I choose to work with Tristan Chamberlain, it doesn’t mean I’ll suddenly fall for him. Do you really think I’d just roll over for any man who shows interest? Do I seem that desperate to you?"

Dominic fell silent, his jaw tightening.

After dinner, Evelyn retreated to her room and opened Tristan’s email, scanning the contents with growing unease.

She might not have been a business expert, but his proposal was crystal clear.

If Thornfield Industries followed his strategy, they might actually stand a chance at revival.

If only he weren’t Bianca Chamberlain’s brother—she would’ve agreed without hesitation.

With a frustrated sigh, she snapped her laptop shut and flopped onto the bed.

Her phone buzzed—Sophie.

[I slept with Adrian Vaughn! Ugh… I think I’m in love with him!]

Evelyn blinked.

She hadn’t seen that coming.

Still, Adrian wasn’t a bad catch—eccentric, sure, but not terrible.

Evelyn: If you’re in love, figure it out. Fate’s playing games with you.

Sophie: He wants me to meet someone important tomorrow but won’t say who. I’m freaking out!

Evelyn: Maybe it’s a surprise?

Sophie: Surprises are fine. Heart attacks are not. Anyway—your husband. Do you two share a room?

Evelyn’s cheeks burned as she typed: Guest bedroom. And no, we’re not discussing him. Drop it.

Sophie: Is he hot?

Evelyn hesitated, but Dominic’s sharp features flashed in her mind—those piercing eyes, that sculpted jawline—and before she could stop herself:

Evelyn: Yes.

Sophie: Damn, girl! You hit the jackpot! How old is he?

Evelyn: Ancient. Basically a fossil compared to us.

Sophie: Older men are better. Experienced. Know how to treat a woman right.

Evelyn: You’ve been binge-watching too many rom-coms.

Sophie: You said he’s hot. That’s all that matters. A gorgeous face cancels out every flaw.

The next morning at breakfast, Evelyn found herself studying Dominic longer than usual.

His dark brows, the smoldering intensity in his gaze, the way his lips curved just slightly when he sipped his coffee—

She swallowed hard.

Maybe Sophie had a point.

Dominic ignored her blatant staring. "Free tonight?"

Her pulse jumped.

Was he… asking her out?

"I think so," she murmured, lowering her eyes to her toast.

"I’ll have the car pick you up in the afternoon."

"Where are we going?"

"You’ll see."

At least this time he gave her warning—unlike that impromptu recital.

Progress.

That evening at 5 p.m., Adrian escorted Sophie into an upscale restaurant.

"Remember that friend I told you about?" Adrian laced his fingers with hers, as if afraid she’d slip away. "The one who got married out of nowhere?"

Sophie frowned, then it clicked.

"Oh—the shotgun wedding guy? The one who got pissed when you actually helped his wife?"

###Chapter 80

Adrian gave a firm nod. "That's him! We met during my time overseas. He's eight years my senior. We were neighbors when he attended university. I used to trail after him constantly back then."

Sophie arched an eyebrow playfully. "You maintained contact despite such an age difference?"

"Absolutely! He's always been my go-to when I need guidance," Adrian confessed.

Sophie studied his face with amusement. "What problems could possibly trouble someone as young as you?"

"I want to launch my own startup, but my family opposes it. Dominic has built an empire - even my father respects him. I need his help convincing them."

Sophie's pulse quickened with excitement.

"What's his full name? If he's such an accomplished entrepreneur, I must have heard of him."

Adrian took a deliberate sip of water. "Dominic Blackwood."

Sophie's mouth fell open in shock.

She dropped Adrian's hand abruptly. "He's married?! Oh my god! My best friend idolizes him... She'll be heartbroken when she finds out!"

"Your friend isn't alone in admiring him. With his wealth and influence, countless women would kill to be in his wife's shoes. Though honestly, she's completely ordinary."

Sophie's eyes narrowed with curiosity. "Who is she? I'm dying to know!"

She pouted dramatically, green with envy.

Adrian deliberately prolonged the suspense. "She's nobody special. You wouldn't recognize her name anyway. You'll see when they arrive." He added pointedly, "And don't mention anything about how Dominic arranged for me to assist her previously, understood?"

Sophie nodded eagerly.

She couldn't wait to discover what kind of "ordinary" woman had captured the legendary Dominic Blackwood.

Evelyn selected a new evening gown for the occasion.

Yet she found it too formal and layered an old blazer over it.

When the chauffeur arrived at Thornfield Industries, he remarked, "You look exceptionally lovely today, Mrs. Blackwood."

Evelyn felt heat rise to her cheeks.

She'd only applied light makeup - just foundation and lipstick.

Could such minimal effort really make such a difference?

In the car, Evelyn retrieved a compact mirror from her purse, studying her reflection.

Perhaps it was her uplifted mood, but her naturally flushed complexion gave her an unusually radiant glow.

Dominic and Evelyn arrived promptly at six.

As they ascended to the private dining area, Sophie immediately recognized the woman beside Dominic.

Evelyn Thorne!

Sophie felt the air leave her lungs.

Time seemed to freeze as her surroundings distorted momentarily before snapping back into focus.

The woman Dominic Blackwood had secretly married was none other than her closest friend, Evelyn Thorne!

She nearly wept from the sheer exhilaration of the revelation.

Noticing Sophie and Adrian, Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Dominic. "You know Adrian Vaughn?"

An uneasy premonition stirred within her.

Dominic noted her sudden tension. "We were neighbors during my postgraduate studies abroad."

They approached the table where waiters promptly seated them.

Evelyn lowered her gaze, her breathing becoming noticeably uneven.

She'd never imagined Dominic and Adrian were acquainted.

Their rapport appeared far from superficial.

Private meetings like this suggested a significant connection. Why exactly had Dominic brought her here to meet Adrian Vaughn?

###Chapter 81

Sophie was desperately trying to catch Evelyn's attention with frantic eye signals, but Evelyn's mind was entirely consumed by one thought—the connection between Dominic and Adrian.

"Miss Thorne, the reason I never mentioned knowing Dominic was to spare you any unnecessary distress," Adrian began, his smile smooth and practiced. "Given your… complicated history, I didn’t want to add to your burdens. I wasn’t trying to deceive you—I genuinely want to acquire Thornfield Industries."

Beneath the table, Sophie’s fingers flew across her phone screen.

Sophie: (Don’t believe him, Evelyn! Dominic Blackwood is the one behind this! It’s him!)

Evelyn glanced at her phone, the notification lighting up the screen.

She read the message, then leveled a frosty stare at Adrian. "Did you discuss this with Dominic?" she demanded.

Adrian’s smile didn’t waver. "I did. He thought it was a worthwhile investment. As I’ve told you before, I’ve been searching for opportunities since I finished university."

Another text buzzed in.

Sophie: (He’s lying! He’s just Dominic’s puppet!)

Evelyn’s chest tightened. She pressed further.

"Did your father really provide the funds? Can I meet him tomorrow?"

Adrian’s expression faltered. "Actually… I borrowed the money. I didn’t mention it because I was embarrassed."

"Who lent it to you?" Evelyn pressed.

Dominic, who had been silent until now, finally spoke.

"I did."

Sophie’s next message came in a flash.

Sophie: (They’re both lying! Dominic is Mr. X! Adrian admitted it to me earlier! Call them out!)

Evelyn’s grip on her phone turned white-knuckled. Her other hand clenched around her water glass.

Her face drained of color, lips pressed into a thin, bloodless line.

Dominic was Mr. X.

He had been using Adrian as a front to take over Thornfield Industries.

Whatever his reasons, the deception left a bitter taste in her mouth.

Why not approach her directly?

Did he think so little of her company?

Or was this just another way to humiliate her?

The memory of her first meeting with Mr. X resurfaced—Dominic’s fury when she’d gone to meet a stranger, the way he’d punished her that night.

Did he think she was a fool?

Did he enjoy manipulating her like this?

If they had been alone, she would have slapped him.

But what would that accomplish?

Evelyn downed the rest of her water in one sharp motion, then stood abruptly.

"Wait!" Sophie called, scrambling after her.

Adrian’s mouth fell open in shock.

What just happened?

Did they know each other?

"Dominic… I’m sorry. I had no idea they were friends!"

His face burned with humiliation.

He’d ruined everything.

Dominic’s expression was ice. His fingers curled into a fist.

"Your girlfriend looked familiar when you sent me her photo. Then I remembered seeing her at the concert hall with Evelyn. She mentioned having friends there."

Adrian blinked. "So… you brought Evelyn because you knew they were close?" His voice was thick with disbelief. "Why take the risk? Why let her find out?"

"Did you tell Sophie anything?" Dominic asked, voice low.

Adrian hesitated. "Just enough to make conversation easier before you arrived… Why is Evelyn so upset? Even if you’re the one behind the acquisition, it’s a massive deal. No one else would offer that kind of money for Thornfield Industries."

"She can’t accept that I’m Mr. X," Dominic replied, his voice rough.

###Chapter 82

If given a second chance, Dominic wouldn't alter a single moment.

He was far from flawless.

Evelyn's arrival in his life had forced him to scrutinize his own actions, to question and refine them.

Without their endless clashes and miscommunications, his feelings for her wouldn't have taken such deep root in his heart.

Sophie caught up to Evelyn outside the restaurant, gripping her arm urgently.

"I can't believe you're married to Dominic Blackwood! This is explosive news!" Sophie gasped, her head spinning from the evening's revelations.

Evelyn, however, felt like a stone had lodged itself in her throat.

"You saw how he was. He's just toying with me."

"Adrian said he only wanted to help but was too proud to admit it," Sophie countered.

She didn't think the situation warranted such a dramatic reaction from Evelyn.

"Come back inside, Evelyn! Let him explain—"

Evelyn pulled free from Sophie's grasp, her voice icy and resolute. "You go ahead. I need to be alone."

She flagged down a cab and vanished into the night.

As Sophie turned to re-enter the restaurant, Dominic strode out, his steps quick and purposeful, as if he'd decided to chase after Evelyn.

Sophie pointed down the street. "She took a cab that way."

Dominic gave a curt nod of thanks before rushing toward the parking lot.

Adrian emerged moments later, his expression accusatory as he approached Sophie.

"You're a traitor."

Sophie's cheeks flushed, but she lifted her chin defiantly. "I've known Evelyn for years. Of course I'm on her side."

"I bet you only dated me to dig for information," Adrian scoffed.

"Exactly!" Sophie shot back without hesitation. "Now that I've got what I needed, we can either keep this going or end it here. It's not like we've known each other long. Might as well cut ties before things get messy."

Adrian inhaled sharply, struggling to find the right words.

He wasn't ready to let her go, but he refused to let her see how much he wanted her to stay.

"You're not breaking up with me until Dominic and Evelyn sort things out," he bargained. "You started this mess—you fix it."

"How is this my fault? I wasn't the one who lied to her!" Sophie protested.

"Didn't you notice she wore makeup tonight? She never bothered before. She did it for him," Adrian argued. "They'd be fine if you hadn't interfered!"

Sophie almost wavered under his absurd reasoning.

"Dominic treats her well. Wouldn't you be moved if a man paid off all your debts?" Adrian pressed.

Sophie hesitated, then sighed. "Maybe. But Evelyn isn't irrational. She has her reasons for being this upset. I still stand with her."

Adrian dragged a hand through his hair in frustration.

Sophie grabbed his arm. "As my boyfriend, you should be on my side! They're like a wolf and a lamb. Why feel sorry for the predator?"

Adrian had no rebuttal.

"I'm starving. Let's eat," Sophie declared, tugging him back into the restaurant.

Evelyn had taken the cab to her mother's house.

She had nowhere else to go.

When Clara saw her daughter's ashen face and hollow expression, she immediately pulled her inside and guided her to the sofa.

"What happened? Did you fight with Dominic?"

If it weren't for him, Evelyn would still be at Blackwood Manor, no matter how upset she was—not here, seeking refuge in her childhood home.

###Chapter 83

"I wish I could rewind time, Mom," Evelyn whispered, her voice barely audible. "Being poor wouldn't be so bad."

Clara settled beside her daughter on the couch, smoothing her hair. "Running away solves nothing, sweetheart. If Thornfield Industries is too much, let it go. Education comes first - money can always be made later."

Evelyn traced her mother's weathered cheek with gentle fingers. "I'm not running. Just... exhausted."

"Then rest. Have you eaten?"

A small head shake.

"Let me fix you something." Clara disappeared into the kitchen.

By eight, Evelyn retreated to her room while Clara took out the trash.

Rain began falling - not a storm, but a persistent drizzle.

Too lazy to fetch an umbrella, Clara dashed toward the dumpster, tossing the bag before turning back.

That's when she saw him.

A towering figure stood rigid at the building's entrance, unnoticed in her earlier haste.

Clara jogged closer, squinting through the rain.

Her breath caught when recognition struck.

Dominic Blackwood stood soaked to the bone, his aristocratic bearing drowned in the downpour.

"Dominic?!" Clara gasped. "What on earth? Come inside!"

She grabbed his arm, but he resisted.

"I can't."

Last time he'd visited, Evelyn had banned him from returning. If he crossed that threshold now...

"You're here for Evelyn, aren't you? She wouldn't tell me why she's upset, but I know it's about your fight."

Dominic wiped rainwater from his face. "I need to apologize."

"Then come inside! How can you apologize out here? She'd hate seeing you like this!"

He escorted Clara under the awning. "She won't want me in your home."

"You two need to talk properly. Let me speak with her."

When Clara entered the apartment, she rushed to Evelyn's room.

Evelyn sprang up at her mother's damp clothes. "You went out in this? You'll catch your death!" She guided Clara toward the bathroom. "Shower now-"

"Evelyn... Dominic's outside." Clara gripped her daughter's hand. "Standing in the rain, completely drenched. Did you turn off your phone? Please let him come up."

Evelyn froze.

"He wants to apologize but refused to enter. Won't you fetch him?"

A dull ache pulsed behind Evelyn's eyes. "Let him stand there if he wants." She turned away. "I'll make tea."

When Clara emerged, steam curled from a mug on the table.

Evelyn sat staring blankly.

"He needs this more than I do."

Evelyn snatched the cup. "I'll dump it then."

Clara intercepted her. "He's not as terrible as you think. The rain's worsening - have you no compassion?"

###Chapter 84

"What about me?" Evelyn's voice trembled as she slammed the teacup onto the marble countertop. The porcelain rattled, threatening to shatter.

She stormed back to her bedroom, her bare feet slapping against the hardwood floors. "Not once has he treated me with basic human decency. Not for a single damn day."

Clara sighed, following her daughter with careful steps. "You come from entirely different worlds, Evelyn. It's natural he'd be... guarded around you." She hesitated, choosing her words like stepping stones across a river. "Forget who he was. Look at the man he's trying to become—"

Evelyn whirled around, eyes flashing. "Since when do you defend him? Do you honestly believe that tyrant will wake up one morning and decide to let me keep my children?"

The silence between them grew heavy.

Clara pressed her lips together before speaking softly. "He must have his reasons for avoiding fatherhood. The fact that he swallowed his pride to come here... that means something."

"Enough!" Evelyn clamped her hands over her ears, nails digging into her scalp. "I'm going to bed. My head is killing me."

Recognizing the finality in her daughter's tone, Clara retreated.

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn collapsed onto the bed, releasing a shuddering breath that had been trapped in her lungs for hours.

The pain behind her temples pulsed like a second heartbeat.

Each throb made coherent thought impossible.

Just the memory of Dominic's face—those cold, calculating eyes—sent phantom fingers tightening around her windpipe.

Twenty minutes later, Clara returned to find Evelyn curled into the blankets, her breathing finally steady.

Dominic remained downstairs.

No amount of pleading had moved him.

Clara had half a mind to drag Evelyn out of bed, but the dark circles under her daughter's eyes stayed her hand.

As for Dominic Blackwood?

They could only hope the storm would pass before dawn.

The rain didn't cease.

If anything, it intensified as midnight approached, transforming into a tempest that shook the windowpanes.

Clara jolted awake at 3 AM to the sound of thunder cracking like gunshots.

She nearly went downstairs—nearly—but fear of what she might find kept her rooted to the mattress.

By six o'clock, dawn painted the flooded streets in murky gray light. Clara threw on a cardigan and rushed downstairs.

The historic district always flooded during heavy rains.

Her breath caught when she saw the empty driveway.

Maybe this humiliation would finally convince him to sign the divorce papers.

What terrified her was the alternative—that everything would revert to that suffocating status quo.

At 11:15 AM, Adrian Vaughn burst into Dominic's corner office at Blackwood Group headquarters, his designer shoes leaving wet prints on the Persian rug.

"Nathan. I've been calling all morning." Adrian raked a hand through his damp hair. "Evelyn took her entire executive team to Veritas Capital this morning. After last night? She'll never sell to Dominic now."

Nathan Cross handed him a crystal glass of ice water. "If she chooses Tristan Chamberlain, there's nothing more to be done."

"This is ridiculous!" Adrian slammed the glass onto the mahogany desk. Water sloshed over the rim. "What exactly did Dominic do wrong? He told one harmless lie to protect her pride—"

"You're too young to understand," Nathan interrupted gently. "Mr. Blackwood isn't acquiring Thornfield Industries out of charity. The company has strategic value."

Adrian blinked.

"Evelyn Thorne reacts emotionally—as women do." Nathan adjusted his cufflinks. "Her anger isn't about money. It's about betrayal."

The unspoken words hung between them:

And Dominic Blackwood had betrayed her in the worst possible way.

###Chapter 85 The Truth Finally Dawned on Adrian

"What now? Would Dominic have to grovel for her mercy?"

"I'll visit them after work," Nathan said.

"Should I ask my girlfriend to check on Evelyn?" Lucas raised an eyebrow. "Since when do you have a girlfriend?"

Adrian cleared his throat awkwardly. "She's Evelyn's closest friend... The one who exposed everything. I swear, if I weren't so crazy about her, I would've ended things last night!"

Nathan exhaled sharply. "You certainly have a type."

"She saw right through me. How was I supposed to know they were that perceptive?"

"Looks like you'll need to watch your words around her from now on. Consider yourself officially out of the inner circle."

"I'll hold my ground!" Adrian declared stubbornly. "For Dominic's sake!"

That evening, Lucas and Nathan arrived at the Blackwood estate.

"Master Dominic returned around dawn," Mrs. Wilkins informed them. "His security detail said he spent the entire night standing in the rain outside Madam Evelyn's mother's house. They only got him home after he collapsed at four in the morning." She wrung her hands. "He's upstairs now. The fever broke this afternoon but has returned with vengeance."

The two men exchanged uneasy glances.

Since when had Dominic Blackwood ever been reduced to such a pitiful state?

Standing all night in a storm for Evelyn Thorne?

"The tempest last night was relentless," Lucas muttered, rubbing his temples.

"It worsened after midnight," Nathan added. "The streets near my place flooded completely."

"No one could endure that downpour unscathed, no matter how strong."

Nathan turned to the housekeeper. "Where's Miss Evelyn? Hasn't she returned?"

Mrs. Wilkins shook her head. "She won't answer my calls. She always picked up before. This quarrel must be particularly severe."

Just then, the physician descended the grand staircase.

"How is he, Doctor?" Lucas inquired.

"The fever persists," the doctor replied gravely. "At this rate, pneumonia is inevitable. I suspect his lungs may already be compromised. I recommended hospitalization, but he refuses."

"We can't allow this!" Mrs. Wilkins fretted. "I'll try Madam Evelyn again. Master Dominic only ever listens to her."

Lucas's expression darkened as he strode toward the door.

Nathan followed. "What if she still won't answer?"

"Then I'll find her myself," Lucas stated.

"Do you know where she might be?"

"With Tristan Chamberlain most likely. His social media posts today were suspiciously cheerful."

"I'll remain here. If his condition deteriorates, I'll have him transported to St. Elizabeth's by force."

Lucas nodded and departed.

Villa Serenade stood as one of Ravenswood's most exclusive dining establishments.

Evelyn had resisted attending, but her management team's persistent badgering wore her down after thirty minutes.

Their persuasion wasn't entirely responsible for her attendance.

Exhausted from maintaining appearances and unwilling to burden her mother with her melancholy, she deemed temporary absence the wiser choice.

Tristan slid a crystal glass of apple juice toward her.

Evelyn lifted it absently, the cool surface chilling her fingertips.

Suddenly, the private dining room's doors flew open.

Bianca Chamberlain's flawless features materialized like an avenging angel.

She stormed toward Evelyn with barely contained fury.

"Enjoying playing two men against each other?" she hissed through clenched teeth.

In one fluid motion, she seized a water glass from the table and hurled its contents at Evelyn's face.

###Chapter 86

Evelyn's cheeks were damp. Though the water had been warm, an icy chill crept down her spine.

"Bianca! What the hell are you doing?" Tristan sprang up instantly, seizing Bianca's wrist and yanking her backward.

"Tristan! Don't interfere! I'm putting this bitch in her place tonight!" Bianca's eyes burned crimson, her shrill voice cutting through the private dining room.

"Have you completely lost your senses?" Tristan thundered.

Never before had Tristan publicly reprimanded Bianca. Rage boiled in her veins as she wrenched her arm free, lunging toward Evelyn again.

Splash!

A wave of crimson juice drenched Bianca's face.

Evelyn slammed the empty glass onto the table, meeting Bianca's dripping gaze with icy composure. "If you're going to attack someone, at least make sure you can handle the consequences."

The room plunged into stunned silence, all eyes locked on the two women.

Evelyn merely sported damp strands clinging to her face, while Bianca was a spectacle - her designer dress ruined, hair plastered with sticky watermelon juice, mascara bleeding down her cheeks.

The once-polished socialite now resembled a drowned raccoon.

"Enjoy your meal. I'm leaving." Evelyn blotted her face with a napkin before striding toward the exit.

Bianca moved to follow, but Tristan blocked her path.

"Bianca, haven't you humiliated yourself enough?"

"Of course you'd take her side!" Bianca shoved against his chest, hot tears spilling over. "You think I'm embarrassing you?"

The truth burned in her chest - Dominic had waited outside Clara's shabby apartment all night in the pouring rain. Even with fever wracking his body, he'd refused medical care. The man Bianca worshipped like a god was being treated like dirt by Evelyn, and the injustice was unbearable.

"Listen to me." Tristan gripped her shoulders, voice dropping to a murmur only she could hear. "The Bianca I know fights with strategy, not tantrums. Remember what I taught you about handling adversaries?"

His words momentarily stilled her tears. Dominic rejected her, and now even Tristan seemed ashamed of her. The loneliness was suffocating.

"I'm trying to protect you," Tristan insisted, steering her toward the restroom. "Emotional outbursts always backfire. We'll discuss this properly later."

As the Chamberlain siblings disappeared, executives from Thornfield Industries and Veritas Capital exchanged uneasy glances.

"What was that about?" a Veritas VP whispered to his Thornfield counterpart.

"Don't ask me," the Thornfield exec muttered. "The Thornes keep their family drama locked up tighter than corporate secrets."

"This could complicate our merger..."

"Relax," the Veritas COO interjected. "Mr. Chamberlain personally oversees this deal. He won't let personal matters interfere."

The Thornfield team exhaled collectively. "Thank God for that."

Outside, Evelyn gasped as winter's bite pierced through her damp blouse. Raindrops began pelting the pavement, each cold sting mirroring the ache in her chest. The storm was coming - she could feel it in the charged air, in the way her wet hair clung to her neck like accusing fingers.

By midnight, the drizzle would become a deluge, but for now, Evelyn stood motionless, letting the first icy drops mingle with the salt on her cheeks.

###Chapter 87

Evelyn’s face was drenched. Even though the water was warm, a cold shiver ran down her spine.

"Bianca! What the hell are you doing?" Tristan sprang to his feet, gripping Bianca’s wrist and yanking her back.

"Tristan! Don’t you dare stop me! I’m going to make her pay tonight!" Bianca’s eyes burned with fury, her shrill voice cutting through the hushed atmosphere of the private dining room.

Tristan’s voice turned icy. "Have you completely lost your mind?"

Bianca had never been publicly scolded by Tristan before. Rage boiled inside her. She shoved his hand away, lunging toward Evelyn again.

Splash!

A wave of crimson juice splattered across Bianca’s face.

Evelyn calmly set the empty glass back on the table, her gaze steady as she took in Bianca’s disheveled appearance. "If you want to mess with me, at least make sure you can handle the consequences."

Silence fell over the room. All eyes flickered between Evelyn and Bianca.

Evelyn had only been splashed with warm water—her face still flawless, if slightly damp.

Bianca, on the other hand, was drenched in sticky watermelon juice, her hair plastered to her cheeks, her once-pristine makeup now a smeared mess.

The contrast was almost comical.

"Enjoy your meal. I’m leaving." Evelyn wiped her face with a napkin, then strode out without another glance.

Bianca tried to chase after her, but Tristan caught her arm.

"Bianca, haven’t you embarrassed yourself enough?"

She let out a bitter laugh. "Oh, so now I’m an embarrassment to you? Let go of me!" She wrenched free, tears streaming down her cheeks.

She had just found out that Dominic had waited outside Clara’s run-down apartment all night in the pouring rain. Even with a raging fever, he refused to go to the hospital.

Evelyn was treating the man Bianca worshipped like dirt, and it was more than she could bear.

"Bianca, think. Is this really how you want to handle things?" Tristan’s voice was low, controlled. "I’ve told you before—when dealing with enemies, you have to be smarter than them. Or have you forgotten?"

His words made her pause.

Dominic didn’t love her. And now, even Tristan was looking at her with disappointment.

She felt utterly alone.

"I’m not trying to humiliate you," Tristan said, gripping her hand firmly. "I just don’t want you to regret this later." He pulled her toward the restroom.

As the Chamberlain siblings disappeared, the executives from Thornfield Industries and Veritas Capital exchanged uneasy glances.

"What was that about?" someone from Veritas murmured.

"No idea," a Thornfield employee muttered back. "We don’t get involved in her personal life."

"This is… complicated."

"Tell me about it. Do you think this will affect the deal?"

"Probably not. Mr. Chamberlain is personally overseeing this partnership. He won’t let anything derail it," the Veritas representative said.

The Thornfield team exhaled in relief. "Good."

Outside the restaurant, Evelyn froze as the cold night air hit her. The early winter chill seeped into her bones, and with her hair still damp, the wind sent an icy prickle across her scalp.

Then the rain began—soft at first, then heavier, relentless.

Evelyn shivered, wrapping her arms around herself as the downpour soaked through her clothes.

She didn’t move.

She just stood there, letting the rain wash everything away.

###Chapter 88

Evelyn didn't return to Dominic's mansion. Nor did she visit him while he was sick.

This time, she was shockingly cold.

But she wasn't the only one treating Dominic harshly.

Lucas was just as ruthless.

Since Evelyn hadn't stepped foot in the mansion or shown any concern for Dominic's condition, Lucas made sure to visit him daily with updates on Evelyn's activities.

Today, Evelyn went to Veritas Capital and had a wonderful morning with Tristan.

Today, they had lunch together.

It didn’t matter if they actually went to an art exhibition. It didn’t matter if they really dined together.

What mattered was that Dominic was furious.

And that was exactly what Lucas wanted.

If Dominic remained bedridden, he couldn’t retaliate.

Using his deep understanding of Dominic, Lucas ensured he suffered every day.

Eventually, Dominic’s condition improved under strict medication. Though still pale and weak, he was determined to leave the hospital.

The reason?

Lucas had told him Tristan was taking Evelyn to an AI technology exhibition.

Lying in bed, Dominic had reflected on many things.

Truthfully, his memories of Tristan were hazy, but this illness had forced him to recall the past.

Tristan was a polished predator—a calculating egoist. Every move he made, whether in friendships or business, was meticulously planned for maximum gain and minimal risk.

He was also a master of deception.

He could smile at an enemy, lull them into lowering their guard, then strike without mercy.

Their estrangement wasn’t just due to incompatibility.

Their investment philosophies had clashed.

Tristan would do anything for money, cozying up to the powerful and laundering dirty wealth.

Dominic, too, pursued profit relentlessly—but he had lines he wouldn’t cross.

Some money wasn’t worth touching, no matter how tempting.

Now, Evelyn was getting closer to Tristan.

If this continued, she’d be dragged into the abyss with him.

"Dominic, the doctor insists you stay in bed for at least another week," Lucas said. "It's windy outside. You’ll only get worse if you go out."

Beside him, the doctor nodded vigorously.

Dominic ignored them.

He strode to the closet, pulled out a charcoal wool coat, and shrugged it on.

Lucas exchanged a resigned glance with the doctor.

Nothing would stop Dominic now.

The AI exhibition was an exclusive event—only fifty seats available.

Yet the stage was massive, promising a dazzling showcase of cutting-edge technology.

Tristan had secured two tickets and invited Evelyn.

She’d agreed without hesitation.

Though she had little experience with AI, curiosity had won her over.

The exhibition began at 2 PM.

At noon, Tristan took her to an upscale restaurant.

These past few days, Evelyn had accepted every invitation—whether for dining or entertainment.

Their conversations were pleasant, but Tristan sensed her distraction.

Her gaze was distant, dull.

If she truly liked him, there would’ve been a spark in her eyes.

But there was none.

###Chapter 89

Tristan wasn't discouraged. He knew Evelyn needed more time.

After placing their orders, they engaged in casual conversation. Evelyn absentmindedly scrolled through her phone.

"Evelyn, any concerns about our partnership?" Tristan asked casually, swirling the red wine in his glass.

She glanced up from her news feed, meeting his gaze.

"Your terms are acceptable, but there are still some internal disagreements on our side," Evelyn replied nonchalantly.

Tristan chuckled. "What kind of disagreements? Maybe I can help."

"It's fine. I'll handle it," she said firmly.

The hesitation came from her own reservations. Thornfield Industries' management was eager to accept Veritas Capital's investment, but Evelyn remained uncertain. She had agreed to meet Tristan to assess his character.

No matter how charming he appeared, he was still Bianca's brother. That alone made it difficult for Evelyn to shake her initial prejudice.

Profit was important, but she had to weigh the risks. Only when she was prepared for the worst outcome would she give her final approval.

Before she knew it, the clock struck two.

Tristan and Evelyn took their seats in the front row of the exhibition hall. The host soon appeared, welcoming everyone with an enthusiastic speech.

"Today, we have a very special guest—one who has made a unique request to our AI companion, Lillian!"

As the host spoke, Lillian made her grand entrance. The robot was strikingly lifelike—a petite female figure with flowing chestnut hair, dressed in a crisp blue-and-white uniform.

"Now, let's see if Lillian can fulfill this mysterious guest's request!" the host announced.

A hush fell over the audience.

Lillian's eyes scanned the crowd before she gracefully descended from the stage.

All eyes followed her, buzzing with curiosity—who was this mysterious guest, and what did they want?

Moments later, Lillian approached the front row. Evelyn watched, impressed by how seamlessly the robot moved. Modern technology had advanced so far—creating machines that could walk and speak like humans was nothing short of extraordinary.

Just as Evelyn marveled at this, Lillian stopped right in front of her. Thinking there might be a malfunction, Evelyn lightly tapped the robot's arm.

To her surprise, Lillian extended a hand and chirped, "Pretty lady, would you come with me?"

Evelyn froze.

The audience erupted in laughter.

Her cheeks warmed. "Lillian, where exactly are you taking me?"

"There's a very handsome man who wants to meet you!" Lillian replied, her voice playful. "He's so handsome! Come, you have to see him!"

The childish enthusiasm in Lillian's tone made refusal difficult.

Evelyn gestured to Tristan beside her, teasing, "There's already a handsome man right here."

Lillian glanced at Tristan, then shook her head emphatically. "No, no! The other one is much more handsome! I want to marry him myself! You'll want to too when you see him!"

The crowd burst into laughter again.

Seeing the standoff, the host intervened. "Miss, why not humor Lillian? We’ll even give you some exclusive gifts afterward!"

Evelyn hesitated. Ignoring the robot was one thing, but refusing the organizers outright would be rude.

Reluctantly, she stood and followed Lillian backstage.

And there, waiting with a familiar smirk, was—

###Chapter 90

Dominic had lost a considerable amount of weight, his once-sharp features now even more striking, carved with an almost ethereal elegance.

What was he doing here? Was he the mysterious guest?

Lillian departed after completing her task.

Watching the AI assistant leave, Evelyn realized the truth—Dominic was indeed the one who had requested her presence.

Hadn’t he been bedridden?

Was he already well enough to be out like this?

She stood frozen, refusing to speak or move toward him.

"Mr. Blackwood, is this the person you were looking for?" the event coordinator asked.

Dominic gave a slight nod. "Thank you."

"Of course," the coordinator replied before stepping away.

Dominic closed the distance between them, his piercing gaze devoid of warmth. "We need to talk."

"Talk?" Evelyn kept her eyes lowered, her tone icy. "About what?"

Unfazed, he reached out, his large hand wrapping around her wrist as he pulled her away.

Backstage was crowded, and whispers would spread like wildfire if they stayed.

Once they left the chaos behind, Dominic guided her through the grand lobby and into the secluded VIP lounge, shutting the door firmly behind them.

His voice was rough but commanding. "Evelyn, stay away from Tristan. Whatever his reasons for getting close to you, he isn’t someone who will bring you anything good."

She met his gaze defiantly. "You just don’t want me working with him because you’re still trying to buy my company, aren’t you?"

His Adam’s apple bobbed, but before he could respond, she pressed on.

"Honestly, you’re being ridiculous. No wonder you’re too ashamed to admit you only offered a hundred and fifty-five million. If I were you, I’d never show my face again after such a pathetic bid."

A faint flush crept over Dominic’s pale skin at her taunt. She always knew exactly how to provoke him.

"Name your price," he rasped, his breathing uneven.

She let out a bitter laugh. "You came all the way here just to negotiate? Fine. But I’m busy today. Let’s discuss it tomorrow—if you’re still interested."

As she turned to leave, his grip tightened around her arm.

"Evelyn," he said, coughing slightly, his voice strained. "I’ll say this one last time. You’re no match for Tristan. If a hundred and fifty-five million isn’t enough, then tell me what you want."

Facing the door, her forced indifference wavered.

He was clearly still unwell. Why had he come here in this state? Couldn’t this have waited until he recovered?

She exhaled slowly before finally speaking. "Three hundred million. And I want an investment, not a buyout."

She didn’t truly expect him to agree—she just wanted to see his reaction. He was the one who had pushed her into this.

"Fine," he said without hesitation. "Now go and cut ties with Tristan."

Evelyn whirled around, her chest rising sharply. "Are you insane? You’re sick—this isn’t the time for business! You need to go home and rest!"

"I’m feeling better," he murmured, though his bloodshot eyes betrayed him.

Suspicious, she pressed a hand to his forehead.

He was burning up.

She pulled back, her voice tight. "Are you leaving on your own, or do I need to call your security?"

"End things with Tristan," he insisted, ignoring her concern.

"I won’t!" Her eyes burned with frustration. "The more you push, the more I refuse! Dominic, I’m not your puppet anymore!"

A flicker of hurt crossed his exhausted face before she tore her gaze away, flung open the door, and stormed out.

The moment she stepped into the hallway, a cold gust of wind sent a shiver down her spine.

###Chapter 91 
The warmth drained from the room the moment Evelyn stepped out, leaving Dominic shivering in her absence.

Evelyn slipped into the restroom to splash cold water on her face. The icy droplets did little to calm the storm inside her.

Returning to the exhibition hall, she forced herself to focus.

The event lasted barely over an hour, yet it felt like mere minutes. Though surrounded by cutting-edge innovations, none of it registered in her mind.

As the exhibition concluded, Tristan approached with an easy smile. "There's a lovely new café nearby. Care to join me for tea?"

Exhaustion weighed heavy on her shoulders. "I think I'll head back to rest," she declined politely.

Noticing the shadows beneath her eyes, Tristan insisted, "At least let me drive you home."

"Thank you," she murmured.

They moved toward the exit, where a familiar figure leaned against the wall.

Vincent Holloway.

Evelyn's spine straightened. "Mr. Chamberlain, would you mind going ahead? There's someone I need to speak with."

Tristan's gaze flickered to the former Thornfield Industries VP. "Of course. I'll be outside if you need me."

Only when Tristan disappeared through the doors did Vincent approach.

"Considering Veritas Capital's offer?" His smile didn't reach his eyes.

"I heard you landed at Aureate Tech. Impressive," Evelyn countered.

Vincent shrugged. "Vice President again. Seems I'm destined to always play second fiddle."

"Then start your own company," she suggested coolly. "Be your own boss."

His chuckle held no warmth. "Too much risk. I prefer letting others take the fall."

Evelyn's mask slipped. "How very... predictable of you."

The civility between them shattered. This was the man who'd orchestrated Julian's downfall. Evelyn's fingers curled into fists.

"Why so tense, Evelyn? Worried?" Vincent leaned closer. "Let me ease your mind - I've lost interest in your precious Cerebra System. My team's developing something far superior. Your technology will soon be obsolete."

"How ambitious." Her voice dripped with disdain.

His jaw tightened. "Aren't you afraid?"

"Shouldn't that be my question?" Evelyn's lips curved into a razor-sharp smile. "However useless Julian may be, he's still a Whitmore. I'd watch my back if I were you."

Vincent's face flushed crimson.

Evelyn strode past him without another glance, rejoining Tristan outside.

"Mr. Chamberlain, you can go ahead. I spotted a flower market nearby - I'd like to pick some up." The lie came easily; she needed solitude.

Tristan hesitated before nodding. "Actually, my father's birthday is next weekend. I'd love if you could attend."

"Of course."

"Bring your mother too. It'll be an intimate gathering at our estate."

"I'll check with her. Thank you."

"No need for thanks." Tristan's smile was genuine. "I'll arrange transportation."

"That won't be necessary. We'll see you at the party."

Only when Tristan's car disappeared around the corner did Evelyn exhale. The wind whipped at her coat as she turned toward the parking lot.

Meanwhile, back at Mooncrest Manor, Dominic lay burning with fever.

The attending physician exchanged a worried glance with Mrs. Wilkins.

The housekeeper pulled a bodyguard aside. "Did Master Dominic see Madam Evelyn today?"

The guard shifted uncomfortably. "They met. And... argued. Why else would he be in this state?"
###Chapter 92

The afternoon sun cast a golden glow over Ravenswood as Evelyn Thorne carried two pots of daffodils from the flower market. She made her way to her mother’s modest rented house, expecting Clara to still be at work. But when she stepped inside, the scent of simmering spices greeted her, and she found Clara bustling in the kitchen.

"Mom? Did you leave work early?" Evelyn slipped off her shoes and placed the flowers on the living room table.

Clara wiped her hands on her apron, her expression sheepish. "I’m not working there anymore, sweetheart. The family hired a more experienced nanny."

Evelyn’s heart ached for her. She wrapped her arms around Clara. "Don’t be upset. You’ll find something better."

Clara chuckled, patting her back. "Oh, I’m fine. But why the flowers?"

Evelyn glanced around the small, sparsely furnished space. "I passed by the market and thought they’d brighten the place up."

Clara sighed. "You don’t need to worry about me. I’ll find another job soon."

"Mom, just take a break!" Evelyn insisted, pulling her bank card from her purse. "Here. Use this for whatever you need."

Clara pushed the card away firmly. "Evelyn, after all these years, I’ve learned one thing—relying on others never ends well. Even if I have to scrub floors tomorrow, I’d rather earn my own way."

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh at her mother’s stubborn pride. "Scrubbing floors at four in the morning? In this weather? No way. Find something easier."

Clara smirked. "If it pays well, I’ll wake up at three. Now sit down. Dinner’s almost ready."

Evelyn settled onto the couch and checked her phone. A message from Sophie Mercer lit up the screen.

[Sophie: What the hell is Dominic Blackwood’s problem? He’s still sick, yet he’s chasing after you? If he really loved you, he’d just hand over the money. This whole act is ridiculous!]

Evelyn sighed, unsure how to respond.

Another message popped up.

[Sophie: Adrian just visited him. The doctor said his immune system’s a mess. Needs hospital treatment. Is it bad?]

Evelyn typed back: [We won’t know until he gets checked.]

[Sophie: So… are you into Tristan now? That’s the rumor.]

Evelyn frowned. [Who’s spreading that?]

[Sophie: People around Dominic. They say you’re ignoring him because you’re with Tristan. Personally, I don’t see it. Tristan’s charming, but he’s got that slippery, too-smooth vibe. Dominic might be intense, but at least he’s not fake.]

Evelyn sipped her water, amused. [You think Dominic’s not intense?]

[Sophie: Oh, he’s intense. But not in a slimy way. More like… the kind of guy who ends up on true crime documentaries. You know, the handsome ones with anger issues.]

Evelyn nearly choked. [What about Adrian?]

[Sophie: Now he’s perfect. Younger, gorgeous, sweet, and clueless. If you divorce Dominic, go for a younger man. Easier to handle.]

Evelyn smirked. [Let’s get the divorce first.]

[Sophie: You’re really going through with it?]

Evelyn’s fingers hovered over the screen. [Why not? It’s not like I’ll get a dime from him either way.]

[Sophie: True. Men like him? They’re untouchable.]

At dinner, Evelyn barely touched her food.

Clara frowned. "Not hungry?"

Evelyn rubbed her stomach. "My bump’s showing."

Clara grinned. "You’re five months along. Of course it is."

"Thank God for winter layers," Evelyn muttered.

Clara hesitated, then said, "I’ve been thinking… What if you went abroad for grad school? Study, have the baby there. Fresh start."

Evelyn blinked. "Mom, that’s expensive. I need to work, not study."

Clara waved a hand. "I’ve saved enough. You focus on your future."

###Chapter 93

Evelyn was stunned. Clara and Richard had divorced when Evelyn was still a child, and she'd been so preoccupied with her own life that she never paid attention to how her mother managed financially. As a result, Evelyn had no idea about Clara's savings.

"It's alright if you don't want to move abroad... I was thinking, maybe we could purchase a smaller property? We can endure some hardship, but we mustn't let the children feel deprived!" Clara continued.

Evelyn blinked. "Mom, do we actually have that kind of money?"

Clara gave a small smile. "We can manage the down payment."

Evelyn exhaled. "Oh... Then there's no hurry. The babies won't arrive for months yet!"

"Time passes quickly, darling. You should consider this carefully."

Evelyn nodded. "Mom, I'm going out. My friend's father has a birthday next week, and I need to buy a gift."

Clara frowned. "Can't you go in the morning? It's getting dark, and I don't like you going out alone at night."

Evelyn waved her off. "The streets are well-lit. I'll be perfectly safe."

Clara sighed. "Fine. Come back soon."

Evelyn grabbed her purse from the sofa and stepped out. She flagged down a taxi and gave Dominic's address. His gaunt, exhausted face kept flashing through her mind, and she couldn't suppress the urge to see him again. Besides, she'd already prepared an excuse.

When the cab stopped at the Blackwood estate gates, Evelyn noticed several unfamiliar vehicles parked in the driveway. It seemed Dominic had visitors. The guard recognized her immediately and opened the gates without question.

Evelyn walked up the path.

Nathan spotted her first and quickly alerted the others in the main house.

Mrs. Wilkins hurried out to greet her. "Madam! You've returned!"

Evelyn kept her voice neutral. "I just came for my laptop."

A flicker of disappointment crossed the housekeeper's face. "Oh... Perhaps you could check on Master Dominic? He's fallen ill again. The doctor says his immune system was compromised after being caught in that downpour..."

Evelyn remained unmoved. She followed Mrs. Wilkins into the living room where all conversation ceased. Though only days had passed, everything felt foreign now. Perhaps it was the icy stares directed her way - they clearly blamed her for Dominic's condition.

"Your laptop is upstairs in your room, untouched," Mrs. Wilkins prompted.

After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn headed for the staircase.

As her footsteps faded, Nathan murmured, "Should someone go up? Bianca's on the second floor. There might be trouble."

Lucas crossed his arms. "Let them sort it out themselves."

Evelyn reached the second floor and paused outside Dominic's open bedroom door.

Dominic lay motionless on the bed, eyes closed in restless sleep, while Bianca gently wiped his forehead with a damp cloth.

###Chapter 94

The doctor and Eleanor were both in the room, standing by the window discussing Dominic's condition.

Evelyn's feet felt like they were weighed down with lead. She couldn't bring herself to step inside.

When Bianca turned from the bed with a glass of water in hand, she immediately spotted Evelyn lingering outside the door.

"Evelyn! What are you doing here?" Bianca hissed, careful not to wake Dominic.

She set the glass down on the nightstand and marched toward Evelyn. Eleanor heard the commotion and followed.

Evelyn instinctively retreated toward the stairs, not wanting to disturb Dominic. But Bianca mistook her movement for an escape attempt and blocked her path.

"Evelyn! Are you playing games with Dominic?!" Bianca's voice was venomous. "If you don't love him, let him go! If you hurt him again, I swear I'll make you regret it!"

Eleanor's sharp voice cut through the tension. "Evelyn, Dominic refuses to divorce you because he's under your spell! I never thought you'd be this ungrateful! I was a fool to believe you were decent! If I'd known, I would've chosen Bianca for him from the start—she's the only one who truly loves him!"

Evelyn had no energy to argue. She'd only come to check on Dominic. Now that she'd seen him, that was enough.

"Just take care of him. I'm leaving." Evelyn pushed past Bianca and descended the stairs, each step heavier than the last.

Downstairs, the group led by Lucas strained to hear the confrontation above.

When Evelyn reappeared, "defeated," the room buzzed with mixed reactions. Some smirked, others shook their heads in pity. But none of it mattered—only Dominic's opinion did. And right now, he was unconscious, oblivious to it all.

"Miss Thorne, you came by taxi, didn't you? Let me drive you back," Nathan offered politely.

Evelyn shook her head. "I'll manage."

She turned toward the door.

Mrs. Wilkins watched Evelyn's slumped shoulders and hurried after her. "Madam, you forgot your laptop."

Evelyn blinked, as if snapping out of a daze. She turned back, crossed the living room, and entered her old bedroom.

"I should go wake Dominic," Lucas muttered. "If Evelyn walks out tonight, she might never come back."

Nathan nudged him. "Then go shout! I'll back you up."

Lucas shot him a look. "Not with Lady Eleanor here. I value my job."

Minutes later, Evelyn emerged, rolling her suitcase behind her. She'd claimed to return for her computer, but it was just an excuse. If Dominic had woken, if they'd talked—maybe things would've been different.

Mrs. Wilkins bit her lip. She'd genuinely hoped Dominic might wake while Evelyn was upstairs. At least then, they'd have had a chance.

"Madam, why not wait until Master Dominic wakes? You could tell him yourself," Mrs. Wilkins suggested.

Evelyn's reply was firm. "No need."

With that, she stepped into the frigid night, suitcase in tow.

Eleanor stormed downstairs, livid.

"Evelyn! Don't you dare come back!"

Lucas sighed inwardly.

She was making everything worse.

Evelyn had always been stubborn. The Mr. X situation still weighed on her, and now Eleanor's outburst had pushed her over the edge. How could she stay after this?

Evelyn ignored Eleanor's threats. Within moments, she vanished into the darkness.

"You all saw it!" Eleanor snapped. "I didn't force her out! She left on her own!"
###Chapter 95

Evelyn still felt uneasy about her situation. Dominic had nearly severed their connection over this woman, after all.

Around midnight, Dominic's fever broke, and he finally stirred awake. The room was bathed in a soft amber glow from the bedside lamp. He pushed himself upright, his gaze landing on Bianca slumped over the edge of the mattress, fast asleep.

A deep frown creased Dominic's forehead as he swung his legs over the side and strode out without a backward glance.

Morning light revealed an empty bed and an even emptier feeling when Bianca awoke. She bolted upright, then rushed downstairs in search of Dominic.

Mrs. Wilkins nearly dropped her tea tray. "I've been down here since dawn, Miss Chamberlain. Mr. Blackwood hasn't come through."

Bianca's face paled. "He's not upstairs either! That's why I came down!"

The housekeeper's hands began to tremble. "Good heavens! The master can't have vanished into thin air!"

Within minutes, they were combing through every room on the second floor. When their search proved futile, Bianca's composure shattered.

Tears streamed down her cheeks. "This is all my fault... I slept like the dead last night. Didn't even feel him leave..."

Mrs. Wilkins hurried to the security gate. "Let me check the logs. If Mr. Blackwood left, there'd be a record."

The report came back negative - no exits recorded. The entire household staff mobilized, scouring Mooncrest Manor from garden to garage.

Thirty frantic minutes later, the team reconvened in the grand foyer.

"Nothing in the east gardens."

"West wing clear."

"Garage and storage areas empty."

"Every ground floor room checked... except Mrs. Blackwood's suite."

Mrs. Wilkins didn't hesitate. She pushed open Evelyn's bedroom door - and there was Dominic, curled under the duvet, breathing evenly.

Closing the door softly, the housekeeper turned to Bianca. "Miss Chamberlain, perhaps you should return home. If Mr. Blackwood requires anything, he knows how to reach you."

Bianca's cheeks flushed crimson. "Why is he in her bed? After everything that's happened between them? How could he—"

"Had you not been in his room last night," Mrs. Wilkins interrupted gently, "he wouldn't have sought refuge here. The master has never tolerated outsiders in his private space."

"Outsider?" Bianca's voice cracked. "After ten years by his side, that's what I am?"

The housekeeper sighed. "Miss Chamberlain, I understand this pains you. But affection cannot be forced where none exists."

"How dare you!" Bianca's manicured nails dug into her palms.

"Our Mrs. Blackwood never raises her voice to staff," Mrs. Wilkins observed. "Not suggesting you're lesser, but perhaps there are qualities worth emulating."

The implication hung in the air like a guillotine.

Bianca stormed out, the mansion's heavy doors slamming behind her.

At eight sharp, Dominic emerged from Evelyn's room, his fever gone but limbs still heavy. Mrs. Wilkins materialized with steaming broth.

"Sir, Mrs. Blackwood returned last night." The housekeeper studied his reaction carefully.

Dominic cradled the bowl but didn't drink, his raised eyebrow prompting her to continue.

"You were asleep when she came up. Miss Chamberlain was... attending to you." Mrs. Wilkins chose her words carefully. "My apologies for allowing her upstairs. I hadn't anticipated such... familiarity."

"Keep her out." His voice was gravel from illness.

With no one else present, the housekeeper laid bare the truth. "Of course, sir. Last evening, Mrs. Blackwood had words with both Miss Chamberlain and Mrs. Blackwood. She took her luggage and left. I fear she may not return to Mooncrest Manor."

###Chapter 96

At precisely ten in the morning, a sleek Rolls-Royce pulled up in front of the weathered gate of a modest community house. The car door swung open, and a tall, imposing figure stepped out.

Dominic Blackwood was dressed in a tailored navy blue quilted coat, a charcoal-gray cashmere scarf draped elegantly around his neck, and polished leather boots that gleamed under the morning light. Despite the layers meant to ward off the chill, his face was unnaturally pale, shadows beneath his eyes betraying his exhaustion. His aristocratic bearing made him seem utterly out of place in the humble surroundings.

Behind him, his driver and bodyguard emerged, arms laden with exquisitely wrapped gifts.

Clara Thorne hurried from the kitchen at the sound of knocking, her eyes widening when she saw Dominic standing at her doorstep.

"You—what are you doing here?" she stammered, then quickly stepped aside. "Come in! I heard you were unwell. Are you feeling better?"

Though early winter had settled in, the weather wasn’t harsh enough to warrant such heavy clothing.

Dominic glanced at the spotless floor and hesitated. "Should we remove our shoes?"

Clara waved a dismissive hand. "No, no need! Just come in."

She ushered him inside, her gaze flickering to the lavish gifts his men carried.

"Why did you bring all this?" she asked, bewildered.

Evelyn had returned home last night with all her belongings in tow. Clara hadn’t dared to pry, but she had assumed her daughter had finally ended things with Dominic for good. She never expected him to show up at her doorstep.

"I came to pay my respects," Dominic said smoothly, settling onto the sofa.

Once the driver and bodyguard had deposited the gifts in the living room, they excused themselves. Clara fumbled for the remote and turned up the heating.

"So… you and Evelyn… last night…" Clara trailed off, uncertain how to broach the subject.

Dominic met her gaze with quiet intensity. "I didn’t see her last night. There’s been a misunderstanding between us."

"Oh." Clara sighed, pouring him a cup of steaming water. "She rarely tells me anything about you two. I don’t even know what to say." She handed him the cup, studying his pallor. "You don’t look well. You should be resting at home."

"I’m fine," he murmured, cradling the cup between his hands.

Clara perched at the edge of the sofa, watching him. Illness had softened his usual commanding presence, making him seem almost vulnerable—a stark contrast to the unapproachable man she’d met before.

After a moment, she gathered her courage. "Dominic, what exactly do you feel for Evelyn? I divorced her father when she was young. She never had a proper family, never knew what it was like to be truly loved." Her voice wavered. "If you don’t care for her, please… let her go."

"Divorce isn’t the issue right now," Dominic said, taking a measured sip. "Recently, she’s been spending time with a man—Tristan Chamberlain. You may not know him, but I do."

Clara’s expression darkened with understanding. "You’re saying he’s dangerous?"

Dominic gave a single, grave nod. "I need you to convince her to stay away from him."

Clara nodded fervently. "Of course. I’ll talk to her as soon as she wakes up."

Dominic frowned, checking his watch. It was already half past ten. Evelyn was still asleep?

Clara noticed his confusion. "She went to bed very late last night. She hasn’t woken yet."

Just then, the bedroom door creaked open.

Evelyn emerged, still in her pajamas, her long hair tousled from sleep. Her drowsy eyes snapped wide the moment they landed on Dominic.

"Evelyn, Dominic is here to see you," Clara said quickly, rising to her feet. "I’ll go pick up some groceries. You two talk."

With that, she made a hasty exit.

Evelyn’s gaze flicked to the heater, then to Dominic’s heavy coat. He was still sick.

###Chapter 97 

Evelyn's fingers curled around the glass as she turned to pour water, her voice crisp. "If you're unwell, Dominic, you should be resting."

The ice cubes clinked against crystal as she filled it to the brim.

"I feel significantly better today." Dominic's long fingers unwound the cashmere scarf from his neck, the fabric whispering against his tailored coat.

"That's precisely what you claimed yesterday." Evelyn took a deliberate sip before setting the glass down with finality. Her gaze caught on the assortment of gift boxes cluttering the living room floor. "What's all this?"

Dominic's shoulders lifted in a practiced shrug. "One doesn't visit empty-handed." He hesitated, then pivoted smoothly. "I only learned this morning that you returned last night."

"Is that why you're here?" Evelyn perched on the sofa's edge, almond-shaped eyes assessing his pallid complexion from across the coffee table.

A full meter of polished oak separated them.

"Regarding Bianca and I—"

"I've no interest in your affairs." Evelyn's interruption came sharp as shattered glass. "Your relationship with her holds no fascination for me."

Dominic watched the glacial set of her features, frustration coiling in his gut.

"Shall we discuss Tristan and me next?" Her chin lifted in challenge. "Dominic, even if he deceives me, the consequences are mine alone to bear. I won't involve you, nor seek your assistance. So spare me your warnings."

Like a willful child, Evelyn seemed determined to touch fire precisely when warned of burns. Dominic's lips pressed into a bloodless line as he absorbed her defiance.

The growl of Evelyn's stomach broke the tension. She rose, padding to the kitchen where Clara's breakfast waited in the warmer. Returning with a steaming bun, she took deliberate bites under Dominic's watchful gaze.

"Was there something else?" Evelyn brushed crumbs from her fingers. "If not, you should leave."

"I'll stay for lunch." The declaration hung between them.

Evelyn's brows arched. Denying a meal seemed petty, even for their strained dynamic. "Stay then. I'm going out." She moved toward the bedroom.

"Evelyn." Dominic followed, his voice roughened. "Will you ever return home?"

Her fingers paused on the doorframe. "This is my home."

"Did Eleanor say something to you last night?"

"No." The lie came easily. No need to upset a recovering man. "Our issues exist between us. We're fundamentally incompatible."

Dominic stepped into the bedroom, shutting the door with a soft click. The confined space—barely ten square meters—suddenly felt suffocating.

"And what constitutes compatibility?" His voice dropped an octave.

"Comfort." Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly. "You make me profoundly uncomfortable."

Dominic's control snapped. "Did Tristan make you comfortable?" The words emerged through clenched teeth. "Answer me."

"Infinitely more than you ever could." When he advanced, Evelyn shoved against his chest. "Don't be obscene! Being ill doesn't grant you liberties!"

The rasp of a zipper filled the room.

Dominic shed his jacket, revealing a gray V-neck that clung to his torso. Beads of sweat glistened at the hollow of his throat as he hung the coat neatly.

"Are you mad? You'll relapse!" Evelyn grabbed for the garment, but Dominic caught her waist, tossing her onto the bed with controlled force.
###Chapter 98

"Evelyn! Have you forgotten who you belong to?!" Dominic's grip tightened around her wrists as he pinned them above her head. His voice was low, dangerous. "I warned you to stay away from Tristan. Don't test me."

It had been weeks since Evelyn had seen him like this—unhinged, volatile. His body was weakened from illness, yet his strength was terrifying. She knew better than to fight back. The more she resisted, the more unhinged he became.

For the sake of the babies growing inside her, she went still beneath him, letting him vent his fury.

"Why aren’t you speaking?" Dominic’s heated gaze burned into her. His fingers traced the curve of her cheek, sliding down to tangle in her hair. "Tell me what you want to hear. I’ll say it."

The fire in his eyes dimmed.

"Evelyn… am I truly beyond redemption?"

His voice was rough, barely above a whisper. His body radiated heat, warming her skin where they touched.

"You’re not," she admitted softly, her mask slipping. "Dominic, you’re extraordinary. Everything about you is… but I just want peace. Let me go."

The fragile hope in his eyes shattered. Before she could say another word, he crushed his lips against hers, silencing her.

At noon, Clara opened the door to Dominic’s bodyguard.

"Where’s Mr. Blackwood?" The man’s posture stiffened when he saw the empty living room.

Clara gestured toward the bedroom. "Inside."

The bodyguard exhaled sharply. "Right."

He wanted to ask when Dominic would emerge, but the answer was obvious—only Dominic knew.

"I made lunch," Clara offered warmly. "Would you like some? Where’s your partner? Call him in."

The bodyguard ignored her, pressing his ear against the bedroom door.

Silence.

Clara sighed. "The walls are thin. If they were talking, we’d hear them. He’s probably resting. He’s still unwell."

The bodyguard scowled. "The doctor ordered him to stay in bed. He shouldn’t have come."

Clara shrugged. "He’s safe here."

"Where’s Evelyn?" the bodyguard demanded.

"With him," Clara answered simply.

His eyes narrowed. "How long have they been in there?"

"About an hour? I was out earlier." Clara turned toward the kitchen. "If you’re not eating, I will."

The bodyguard’s jaw clenched. Their relationship had been strained, and Dominic was weakened. What if Evelyn—

He didn’t wait. He shoved the door open.

The sight that greeted him was unexpected.

Dominic lay motionless on the bed, bare-chested, eyes closed.

Evelyn stood beside him, clutching a blanket. She startled at the intrusion.

"What did you do to him?!" the bodyguard snarled, lunging forward to check Dominic’s pulse.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "He’s not dead. Just asleep."

The bodyguard pulled back, embarrassed, then glared at Dominic’s exposed torso. "Why is he undressed? What kind of woman are you?"

"Don’t insult me!" Evelyn snapped. "He did it himself. Ask him when he wakes if you don’t believe me!"

The bodyguard’s gaze flickered over her—the thin nightgown, the marks on her skin. His face darkened.

"I’ll be outside. You take care of him." He stormed out.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, sinking onto the edge of the bed. Her eyes drifted to Dominic’s sleeping form.

What a mess.
###Chapter 99

Dominic slept deeply, his brow damp with sweat. Though his fever had broken, Evelyn was utterly drained. She curled up beside him and drifted into an exhausted sleep.

Evelyn awoke at half past three, her stomach growling. She slipped out of bed, changed into fresh clothes, and stepped into the living room. The scene before her made her pause—the bodyguard and driver lounged on her sofa, engrossed in a TV show, while Clara sat at the kitchen counter, scrolling absently on her phone.

Everything looked peaceful… yet it grated on her nerves how comfortably they’d made themselves at home.

"Evelyn, you must be starving," Clara said, setting her phone aside and moving toward the fridge. "Let me heat up some leftovers for you."

Evelyn strode into the living room and addressed the driver. "Your boss will probably wake soon. Go fetch him a clean change of clothes."

The driver jumped to his feet. "Right away."

Once he left, Evelyn switched off the TV and fixed the bodyguard with a sharp look. "My mother suffers from migraines. Loud noises trigger them. If you’re staying here, keep it down."

The bodyguard swallowed his protest. After all, his employer was still asleep in her bed—who knew when he’d stir? What if he didn’t wake until midnight?

His fears proved justified. By six, the sky had darkened, yet Dominic showed no sign of waking.

Clara turned to Evelyn. "Sweetheart, I’ll book a hotel for tonight."

Evelyn shook her head. "No, Mom. I’ll just wake him."

The bodyguard cut in, voice gruff. "He’s sick! He needs rest! Don’t disturb him!"

Evelyn’s eyes flashed. "This is my house!"

The bodyguard ignored her, pulling out his wallet and thrusting a wad of bills at Clara. "Mrs. Thorne, take this for the hotel. My treat."

His tone brooked no argument. Clara hesitated, unnerved by his intensity.

Evelyn nudged her. "Take it, Mom."

If he was offering money, they might as well accept.

Clara pocketed the cash but still seemed uneasy. "I’ll go find a place now."

Evelyn caught her arm. "Wait a little longer. He’ll wake up soon."

The bodyguard huffed. "Mrs. Thorne, let me drive you. Who knows when Mr. Blackwood will leave? It’s getting late."

As if summoned by his words, Dominic stirred the moment they left. Evelyn pressed a hand to his forehead—cool, no fever.

"You’ve slept all day. It’s dark out. Get up and go home," she said, tossing him the fresh clothes the driver had brought earlier.

Dominic blinked, his eyes bloodshot as he scanned the room.

"Up. Now. This is the only bed we have," Evelyn insisted.

His voice came out rough. "I’m dizzy—"

"Stop faking. Your fever’s gone," she snapped.

Then he coughed—deep, wracking spasms that made Evelyn wince. She bit her lip. No fever didn’t mean fully recovered. Sighing, she marched out and flagged down the driver.

"Dominic’s awake, but he says he can’t get up—"

The driver shrugged. "Then let him rest. I’ll fetch his meds."

With that, he vanished. Evelyn massaged her temples. Was she really stuck with him overnight?

###Chapter 100

The driver arrived with all of Dominic’s necessities, including a lavish dinner. Mrs. Wilkins had packed enough food in thermal containers to feed three people.

"Miss Thorne, here’s Mr. Blackwood’s medication. Thank you for taking care of him tonight." The driver handed Evelyn the medicine with care before leaving.

Evelyn sank onto the sofa, staring at Dominic’s belongings scattered across the table.

Had she been too lenient? She should have kicked him out hours ago. Now she was stuck dealing with this mess.

A cough echoed from the bedroom. Sighing, Evelyn grabbed the medicine and pushed the door open. With just the two of them in the apartment, she left it ajar for ventilation.

Dominic had showered and changed into fresh clothes, but the bed was a disaster.

"Do you have hot water?" His voice was rough with thirst.

Evelyn set the medicine on the nightstand and headed to the kitchen. Dominic followed, his steps unsteady.

"Where’s your mother?" he asked.

"Thanks to you, she’s staying at a hotel tonight." She thrust a glass of warm water into his hands. "Are you hungry? The driver brought dinner. You should eat something."

He hadn’t eaten since noon and had slept through the evening. He had to be starving.

"Just some soup." His appetite was nonexistent.

Evelyn retrieved the meal from the living room, including a steaming bowl of soup.

Dominic drank it slowly before setting the spoon down.

"I made a mess of the bed. Do you have clean sheets? I’ll change them." Though still pale, the shower had left him looking slightly more alert.

"Dry your hair first. I’ll handle the sheets." She couldn’t bring herself to snap at him when he looked this pitiful.

"Where’s the hairdryer? I couldn’t find it."

Evelyn marched to the bathroom and fetched it for him. He took it wordlessly while she stripped the bed and replaced the linens. Their movements were oddly synchronized, like a long-married couple accustomed to each other’s habits.

At nine, Evelyn’s phone buzzed with an incoming video call. She dismissed it without a second thought, but the caller persisted. Reluctantly, she answered.

Three faces from Thornfield Industries’ management team filled the screen.

"Evelyn, have you reconsidered Veritas Capital’s offer? It’s an incredible opportunity for us. What’s holding you back?"

"I spoke to Tristan’s assistant today. He confirmed Tristan hasn’t made any unreasonable demands—he’s just waiting for your response."

"We agreed on a deadline. This is for the company’s survival. Are you reneging on your word? We know you and Bianca have history, but what does that have to do with Tristan? No one else is willing to invest actual money in us!"

Evelyn’s temple pulsed as their voices overlapped.

"Give me another week."

"Another week? You said the same thing last time!"

"Exactly! How long do you plan to drag this out? If you don’t care about the company, just reject Tristan outright! But you’re neither accepting nor refusing—what’s your game?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Tristan’s father’s birthday is next weekend. He invited me to the party. I’ll give you an answer after that."

"An answer to us? You mean an answer to him!"

"Yes. Next weekend. It’s late—you should all get some rest."

She ended the call before they could protest. Dominic sat beside her, and she had no doubt he’d be staying the night.

###Chapter 101

The room held only one bed. Since Dominic was ill, Evelyn had no choice but to let him have it.

After her shower, she settled onto the sofa, resigning herself to spending the night there.

But thirty minutes later, Dominic appeared beside her. Having slept all afternoon, it was no surprise he wasn’t tired. Evelyn couldn’t exactly force him back to bed.

On the video call, the tech department manager groaned, "You've been dragging this out, costing me a week of sleep! Evelyn, we need to talk honestly!"

The head of development chimed in, "I haven’t slept properly either! And my appetite’s gone!"

"My hair’s falling out in clumps! And I didn’t have much to begin with!" the HR manager added.

These men were clearly spinning sob stories to pressure her into making a decision.

Dominic scowled and snatched the phone from Evelyn’s hand.

She gasped. "Hey! I’m in the middle of a call! Give it back!"

She lunged for it, but he held it just out of reach.

"Who’s that man? He looks familiar."

"Must be Evelyn’s boyfriend! Still with her this late? Definitely her boyfriend!"

"Wait… doesn’t he look like—?"

On the screen, the three men debated the stranger’s identity.

"Evelyn, how do you hang up? I can’t find the button." Dominic studied the phone for a few seconds before handing it back in defeat.

She immediately ended the call.

"What were you thinking, taking my phone like that?" she snapped.

He blinked lazily. "Their voices were grating. It’s nine at night, not nine in the morning."

"If it bothers you, go home. This is my apartment." She snatched the phone and marched toward the bedroom.

Dominic followed.

Meanwhile, the three managers had started a private call.

"Did you see that? Evelyn’s boyfriend—doesn’t he look like Dominic Blackwood?"

"I’ve only seen photos of him."

"I saw him once, but I was in the back row, hundreds of meters away."

"Haven’t you heard his voice before? That man sounded like him."

"How would we know? We’ve never met him!"

"It has to be him. No wonder she’s stalling with Tristan. She’s got a better option!"

"If that’s true, Evelyn’s playing a dangerous game. Keeping quiet while landing bigger deals?"

"I owe her an apology. I’ve been harassing her daily, calling her clueless!"

"Hold on. Let me confirm if that’s really Dominic first."

Back in the bedroom, Evelyn clutched her throbbing head and collapsed onto the bed. Dominic lay beside her and turned off the lights.

Her eyes were closed, but her sharp breaths betrayed her irritation.

Dominic broke the silence. "I’ve met one of those men before."

She turned her head. "Which one?"

"The heavyset one with glasses."

She shrugged. "So?"

Dominic exhaled. "He recognized me. We can’t hide this anymore." A pause. "I’ll offer three hundred million. Let’s see if Tristan matches it."

"Are you insane?" She kicked him. "This isn’t an auction!"
###Chapter 102

Evelyn said firmly, “Dominic, I won’t take your money. Don’t bring it up again.”

His voice darkened. “Why not? Is my money tainted?”

She hesitated before answering, “I don’t want anyone’s money. I don’t want to rely on others.”

Her words left Dominic silent.

“I’m going to sleep. Don’t disturb me.”

Evelyn turned her back to him, her slender frame barely visible under the thin blanket. Dominic reached out to tuck the thicker blanket around her, but she pushed it away immediately.

“Use yours. Don’t touch mine.”

The bed held two blankets—his thick, hers light. The heater hummed softly, keeping the room warm.

“You should take the thick one,” Dominic offered. His weakened constitution made him sensitive to the cold, and he assumed she felt it too.

Evelyn scoffed. “Trying to give me heatstroke? Just sleep. You need to leave before my mom gets back tomorrow. Your presence is disrupting our lives.”

Dominic pulled his blanket up. “Fine.”

Ten minutes later, Evelyn grabbed her phone and turned toward him. The dim glow illuminated his face—his eyes open, dark and unreadable.

“Why aren’t you asleep? Are you cold?” she asked.

“A little. Aren’t you?”

Evelyn wore a short-sleeved shirt, her arms bare, while Dominic was bundled under layers. They might as well have been in different seasons.

“Don’t worry about me. I’ll get you another blanket.” She started to rise.

Dominic caught her wrist. “Just share yours.”

“Oh.”

She reluctantly shifted, allowing him half of her blanket. But now, the only way to stay covered was to press closer to him. Realizing this, she tried to sit up again.

“Stop moving,” he murmured, pulling her back. His arm draped over her, warm and heavy.

Eleanor Blackwood sat stiffly on the sofa in Dominic’s mansion, too furious to eat. When the driver returned from delivering Dominic’s belongings, she interrogated him.

“Is the apartment small?”

“Tiny,” the driver admitted. “The entire place isn’t as big as this living room.”

Eleanor’s gaze swept the grand space, her blood pressure spiking.

“When I left, Clara had already checked into a hotel. Only Mr. Blackwood and Evelyn are there now.”

“That girl—” Eleanor’s hands clenched. “What if she harms him? Dominic is ill! How could you leave him alone with her? Where’s the bodyguard? He must never leave his side!”

The driver stammered, “It’s… probably fine. The bodyguard mentioned they, uh… reconnected earlier. There might still be feelings.”

Eleanor’s eyes widened. “He’s sick! How could he—? That vixen! I’m bringing him home. If he stays with her, she’ll drain him dry!”

Mrs. Wilkins exchanged a glance with the driver before stepping forward. “If you go now, you’ll only push him further away. Let the driver fetch him tomorrow.”

“You’ve been brainwashed too!” Eleanor snapped, shaking her off.

Mrs. Wilkins retreated, wisely silent.

“Take me there,” Eleanor ordered the driver. “I’ll just watch from outside. I won’t go in.”

Minutes later, the car idled outside Evelyn’s rundown apartment complex. Eleanor stared at the peeling paint and cracked sidewalks, tears welling in her eyes.
###Chapter 103

"My son has never endured such harsh conditions since birth... Never! What kind of cruel fate is this? It's all my fault! Why did I arrange for Evelyn to marry him? There were countless women to choose from, yet I picked this scheming vixen!"

In the dimly lit room, Dominic's breathing slowly steadied. Evelyn reached out, her fingers brushing against his forehead. Though he was still unconscious, his temperature felt normal. Worried he might wake up thirsty, she slipped out of bed and poured a glass of water, placing it carefully on the nightstand.

When dawn broke, Evelyn found the space beside her empty. She grabbed her phone to check the time—8:17 AM.

A message from Dominic glowed on her screen, sent at 6:03 AM: Slept better last night than I have in months. Had to leave early for a meeting.

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks. Why did a simple text make her feel like this? She quickly turned off the heater with the remote. After freshening up, she joined Clara in the kitchen for breakfast.

"So," Clara slid a plate of scrambled eggs toward her, "what's really going on between you two now?"

Evelyn feigned ignorance. "What do you mean?"

Clara leveled her with a look. "Don't play dumb. You’ve been talking about divorce, yet here he is, sleeping under your roof. That man isn’t letting you go anytime soon. And if you ask me? He’s utterly smitten."

Evelyn stabbed a fork into her toast. "Mom, his feelings don’t define my worth."

Clara sighed. "Then what’s your plan if he refuses to sign the papers?"

"I’ll leave. Study abroad if I have to."

"Good!"

"Let’s just eat. The eggs are getting cold."

Dominic emerged from his shower, a towel slung low around his hips. He dressed swiftly in his walk-in closet before heading downstairs.

Mrs. Wilkins paused mid-step when she noticed his lighter attire. "Master Dominic, aren’t you freezing?"

"Never felt better," he replied, pouring himself coffee.

The housekeeper gaped. Yesterday, he’d looked like death warmed over. Now? Vibrant. Had all those medications been less effective than a single night near Evelyn?

At Blackwood Group, whispers trailed Dominic to his office. Executives hovered at his door.

"Mr. Blackwood, you’re... recovered?"

Nathan intercepted their stares. "A minor cold, gentlemen. Hardly worth the dramatics."

Dominic ignored them. "Get Bianca here."

The moment Nathan dialed, the crowd dispersed.

Bianca arrived breathless. "Dominic, you shouldn’t be here! What if you relapse?"

"Your father’s birthday is this weekend, correct?"

Her eyes lit up. "You remembered? I didn’t mention it because—"

"I’ll attend."

Her smile faltered as he continued, "Because your brother invited my wife. Let’s be clear, Bianca—this changes nothing between us."

The words hung like a guillotine.

###Chapter 104

Bianca's smile vanished. "You've never looked at me that way, have you?"

Dominic's reply was ice-cold. "Find someone who will."

Without another word, Bianca turned on her heel and walked away.

That evening, drowning in frustration, Bianca called Tristan out for drinks.

Tristan took one look at her miserable expression and scoffed. "No man would want you looking like that."

Bianca's eyes burned with unshed tears. "I have to pretend all day in public! Can't I just be myself at home?!"

Tristan poured her a generous glass of wine, his voice deceptively soft. "Bianca, we still don't see eye to eye as siblings. But if you'd just listen to me, you could have everything."

She downed the wine in one gulp, her bloodshot eyes locking onto his. "Can I have Dominic?"

Tristan's lips curled into a dangerous smile as he pulled her close, his breath hot against her ear. "Not alive. But if he's dead... I can give you his ashes. That way, you'll have him—indirectly. How's that sound?"

Bianca recoiled as if burned, shoving him away with a force that sent him crashing into the table behind him.

"Tristan! Are you out of your damn mind?! If you lay a finger on Dominic, I swear to God, you're dead to me!"

A sharp crack echoed as Tristan's back hit the edge of the table. He doubled over, his face contorted in pain.

"Tristan! I—I didn't mean to!" Bianca rushed to help him up, guilt twisting her features. "I just... Dominic is my line. Don't cross it."

Gritting his teeth, Tristan straightened slowly. "He's already crossed mine. Three hundred million—he's pouring it into Thornfield Industries. Tell me, Bianca, is that company even worth half that? This is a direct challenge."

Bianca froze.

"What? Since when? Why haven't I heard about this?"

"Because he doesn’t trust you." Tristan winced as he lowered himself onto the sofa. "And he made sure I found out. My guess? He and Evelyn had a little private chat." He gestured toward the medicine cabinet. "Get me something for the pain."

As Bianca rummaged through the cabinet, her mind raced. Maybe Dominic and Evelyn would never divorce. The way he looked at her, the way he fought for her—Bianca had never seen him like this with anyone. Not in ten years.

She had lost. Utterly.

The Chamberlain family’s hillside villa in Ravenshore City’s St. Elric District was alive with celebration for Tristan’s father’s birthday. Since Ravenswood was just a short drive away, Evelyn could have made it in under an hour.

Tristan called her early that morning, offering to pick her and Clara up.

Evelyn declined politely. "My mother isn’t coming, and I have to stop by the university first. Don’t wait for me—go ahead."

She had no real plans, and Tristan knew it. She just didn’t want to ride with him.

"Fine," he said, his voice tight. "But get there early. There’s something I need to discuss with you."

Evelyn hesitated. "Actually... there’s something I need to tell you too."

After hanging up, she collapsed back into bed. She’d stayed up all night finishing her thesis, and exhaustion weighed heavy on her.

By noon, the Chamberlain villa’s sprawling parking lot was packed with luxury cars.

Dominic strode into the ballroom, his gaze sweeping the crowd.

"Evelyn’s not here yet," Bianca said, appearing at his side. "Did you two make up? I thought you’d come together."

Dominic took a sip of water, his expression unreadable. "Maybe tomorrow."

Bianca led him to his seat, her tone carefully neutral.

"I heard about the three hundred million investment in Thornfield Industries. Dominic, as a friend, I have to say—that’s reckless."

Dominic’s fingers tightened around the glass. "What I give her is between us. Stay out of my family matters."

Bianca’s face paled.

Family matters.

He could dismiss three hundred million like it was nothing.

"Fine," she snapped. "I won’t say another word about you and Evelyn."

Dominic smirked. "See that you don’t."

###Chapter 105

Bianca was utterly speechless.

She had spent the entire morning mentally preparing herself, determined not to feel a shred of jealousy when she saw Evelyn with Dominic.

Yet, the moment she laid eyes on them, her carefully constructed defenses crumbled.

The pain was unbearable.

Without another word, Bianca turned and fled the banquet hall.

From a distance, Tristan watched as his sister was once again dismissed by Dominic.

What stung more was that it happened in their own home.

Tristan would be lying if he said it didn’t hurt.

He would also be lying if he claimed it wasn’t humiliating.

A decade of Bianca’s youth, wasted on Dominic.

Tristan clenched his fists.

He wanted Dominic to pay.

After lunch, Dominic retreated to the guest room to rest.

Evelyn wasn’t supposed to arrive yet.

Hadn’t she claimed she was comfortable with Tristan?

Was she lying to him?

Dominic didn’t bother lying down.

He wasn’t sleepy—just avoiding the crowd.

Instead, he sent a quick text to his bodyguard.

Call me when Evelyn arrives.

After setting his phone aside, he pulled a book from the nearby shelf.

Around four in the afternoon, hushed voices drifted in from outside the door.

“Do you know Evelyn Thorne?”

“Of course! That’s the woman Young Master Tristan is obsessed with!”

“Exactly. He just ordered me to prepare women’s essentials and deliver them to his room. Looks like she’s staying the night.”

“When it comes to seduction, Young Master Tristan never fails. Want to know his secret?”

“What is it?”

“He has a way of making women obey him. By—”

The voices abruptly lowered, then faded as footsteps retreated.

Dominic’s jaw tightened.

He strode toward the door—just as his phone rang.

He turned back and answered.

“Mr. Blackwood, Evelyn’s here. Tristan met her at the entrance. He’s taking her to the south wing now,” the bodyguard reported.

“Follow her.”

“Sir, the Chamberlain family’s guards are blocking the south wing. Outsiders aren’t permitted. I asked around—that’s where Tristan’s father resides.”

Dominic hung up.

He scrolled through his contacts and dialed Evelyn’s number.

“Evelyn, my father prefers silence. Loud noises trigger his migraines,” Tristan explained as they walked.

Evelyn nodded. “I’ll mute my phone.”

“No need. There’s no signal here anyway. The entire area is shielded.”

Evelyn blinked. “His condition is that severe?”

Tristan sighed. “We’ve consulted countless specialists. Nothing worked. Isolation is the only relief.”

“Then why host a birthday party?”

Tristan chuckled. “He didn’t always despise crowds. Before his illness, he thrived in them.”

Evelyn’s fingers twisted nervously.

“Why does your father want to see me alone?”

Tristan gave her a reassuring smile. “Relax. He just wants to talk.”

Dinner came and went with no sign of Evelyn or Tristan.

Dominic had called repeatedly—no answer.

Not from Evelyn.

Not from Tristan.

His chest tightened.

Without hesitation, he stormed out of the banquet hall and headed straight for the south wing.

###Chapter 106

Dominic was intercepted by the Chamberlain family's security team as he approached the southern wing of Mooncrest Manor.

"Access is restricted, Mr. Blackwood."

"Move aside!" Dominic's voice was a thunderous growl, his eyes blazing with barely restrained fury. "My wife is in there!"

"You mean Miss Thorne?" The guard hesitated before adding, "She left for a hike with Mr. Chamberlain just moments ago."

Dominic's jaw tightened, his gaze turning glacial—colder than the darkest depths of winter.

The guard gestured toward a nearby hillside. "They went that way, but it's already dark, and the terrain is treacherous. If you're unfamiliar with the path, I'd advise waiting inside. They should return shortly."

Dominic's fists clenched. Without another word, he turned and stalked toward the hill.

Inside the south wing's grand living room, Evelyn had just endured two excruciating hours of Tristan Chamberlain's father recounting the founding of Veritas Capital and his unsolicited opinions on Thornfield Industries. She was desperate for an escape.

"Thank you for your time, Mr. Chamberlain," she said, forcing a polite smile. "Since tonight is your celebration, I'll discuss business matters with Tristan another day."

Had the elder Chamberlain not been the guest of honor, she doubted she could have tolerated his rambling any longer.

Tristan checked his watch and smoothly intervened. "Father, you should rest. Evelyn and I are going to grab a bite."

As they stepped outside, Evelyn inhaled the crisp night air—but instead of relief, an unsettling weight settled in her chest.

The unfamiliar estate stretched endlessly around her, its sprawling grounds amplifying her unease.

"Tristan," she finally said, steeling herself, "I can't accept your investment."

He halted mid-step, his charming demeanor slipping. "Why not? Give me one good reason."

"Because you're Bianca's brother," Evelyn stated plainly. "I can't separate business from personal history."

"Did Dominic Blackwood influence this decision?" Tristan's voice sharpened. "Are you taking his money instead?"

Though he'd anticipated her refusal, the rejection still stung.

"I won't be accepting his investment either," Evelyn replied, her tone resolute. "I need to catch the last train home, so I'll have to skip dinner."

She'd come solely to deliver her answer.

Now that it was done, there was no reason to stay.

Tristan hadn't expected such cold finality.

Her bluntness reminded him painfully of Dominic.

Was that why they were drawn to each other?

He seized her wrist. "At least stay for dinner. Dominic's here—he can drive you back. I won't let you leave alone this late."

Evelyn pulled free. "I already called a cab. It'll be here soon."

"Evelyn." His voice turned uncharacteristically harsh. "Just because we're not business partners doesn't mean we're enemies. Stay."

She exhaled slowly.

She hadn't intended to burn bridges.

Friendship was impossible, but she didn't need more adversaries.

When Tristan guided her back to the banquet hall, Bianca stormed toward them, eyes blazing.

Without a word, she yanked Tristan outside.

Their abrupt exit killed Evelyn's appetite.

Bianca's expression had been unnervingly venomous—like storm clouds before a lightning strike.

Evelyn scanned the room nervously.

No one else seemed to notice the siblings' tension.

Tristan had mentioned Dominic was present... so where was he?

Outside, Bianca whirled on her brother. "Where is he, Tristan? Where the hell is Dominic?!"

###Chapter 107

Tristan smoothed his crumpled shirt with a sharp flick of his wrist, his voice icy. "I'm not his babysitter, Bianca! I don't have time to track his every move. Find him yourself!"

Bianca's fist collided with his chest in a burst of fury. "His phone's dead, and no one's seen him! Even his own bodyguard has no clue where he is! Stop lying—you planted that signal jammer on purpose! This is all part of your twisted plan!"

Tristan clamped a hand over her mouth and hoisted her over his shoulder effortlessly.

"Listen carefully, Bianca," he growled. "You're staying in your room tonight. After this, you won’t have to suffer anymore."

Back in the banquet hall, Evelyn shot up from her seat.

Her pulse quickened as she scanned the sea of unfamiliar faces.

She pulled out her phone—missed calls and a single text from Dominic: [Come find me when you see this. I’ll be in the banquet hall.]

But Evelyn was already there. Where was he?

She dialed his number, only for the call to drop instantly.

Was the south wing not the only dead zone?

A shadowy figure in black rushed toward her, panic etched across his face.

"Have you seen Mr. Blackwood?" Dominic’s bodyguard demanded, his voice strained.

"No! Wasn’t he with you?" Evelyn’s chest tightened as paranoia clawed at her thoughts. "I tried calling—no signal here!"

"That bastard Tristan must’ve used a jammer! I lost track of him—didn’t even realize he was gone until Miss Bianca came screaming at me!"

Evelyn’s fists clenched as she remembered the venom in Bianca’s eyes when she’d confronted Tristan earlier.

"Tristan… I’m going after Tristan!" she declared.

"I’m coming with you!"

When they reached the south wing of Mooncrest Manor, Dominic’s bodyguard lunged at one of Tristan’s guards, fingers digging into his throat.

"Where the hell is Tristan Chamberlain?! Take me to him—now!"

Evelyn shoved the bodyguard back. "He can’t talk if you’re choking him!"

The guard gasped for air, coughing violently. "I—I don’t know where Mr. Chamberlain is! I’m just stationed here—I swear!"

"Did you see Dominic Blackwood pass through?" Evelyn pressed.

A cold dread settled in her stomach.

Dominic had been calling her all afternoon. He’d waited for her.

He must have known where she was and come looking.

Noticing the flicker in the guard’s expression, Dominic’s bodyguard kicked him to the ground.

"Where. Is. He?" he snarled, pressing his boot against the man’s skull. "Three seconds. Three… two…"

"He went up the hill!" the guard wheezed, pointing into the darkness. "That way!"

"Bullshit! Why the hell would he go up there in the dark?" The bodyguard ground his heel harder. "Talk!"

Evelyn’s heart hammered against her ribs, tears stinging her eyes.

Dominic had only just stopped using his wheelchair.

He wasn’t strong enough for that climb—not in this darkness.

The guard’s voice was barely a whisper. "He… went… to find… Miss Thorne…"

Then his body went limp.

###Chapter 108 
The Mooncrest Manor stood perched midway up the mountainside.

A serpentine but well-paved road wound its way from the base of the mountain directly to the manor gates.

Beyond that point, no proper trails led to the summit.

Darkness had already fallen when Dominic began his treacherous ascent from Mooncrest Manor.

Using his phone's flashlight, he pressed forward with urgent steps.

Fear for Evelyn's safety gnawed at him.

Tristan's malicious intentions toward Evelyn were clear, and Dominic dreaded what might be happening to her if he arrived too late.

Had he known about Tristan's vile schemes, he would never have let Evelyn out of his sight.

Thirty minutes later, Dominic's breathing came in ragged gasps, though that discomfort paled in comparison to the agony in his legs.

His physician had strictly forbidden any strenuous activity for six months.

Only gentle walking was permitted, and even that in limited durations.

Mountain climbing—with its brutal impact on knees—was absolutely prohibited and carried severe risks.

The night wind whispered through the trees, rustling leaves in the darkness.

Dominic staggered to a stop as searing pain shot through his lower body.

He tried calling his security detail again, but his phone still showed no signal.

He could turn back. The remnants of his strength might carry him down safely.

The thought flickered and died instantly.

Gritting his teeth, he forced himself onward.

Finding Evelyn and bringing her to safety was all that mattered.

Then disaster struck.

His battered legs finally gave out, sending him tumbling backward.

As he fell, fear for himself never crossed his mind—only Evelyn's face.

Her radiant smile, her sorrowful tears, the way her brows knitted in anger, her composed dignity...

Only Evelyn.

True terror struck at the last moment—visions of what Tristan Chamberlain might be doing to her!

He plunged into endless blackness.

The sickening thuds echoing in his skull marked each impact with jagged rocks and broken branches.

He didn't know where he was falling, or if this would be his end.

"Dominic! Can you hear me? Dominic Blackwood!" Evelyn's desperate cries pierced the night. "I never went up there! Dominic! I'm right here!"

"We're searching for you, sir!" his bodyguard shouted. "Make a sound if you can hear us! Just one sound! We'll find you!"

Only the mournful wind answered their calls.

With each step upward, Evelyn's dread grew.

The mountainside path was treacherously steep!

She could only ascend by clinging to the bodyguard's arm.

With Dominic's legs still healing, why would he attempt this madness?

How could he dare?

How could he be so reckless?

Hot tears streaked down Evelyn's cheeks.

"Dominic!" she sobbed between gasps.

The bodyguard, impatient with Evelyn slowing their progress, shook her off. "Wait here. I'll find him!"

He continued alone up the treacherous slope.

Evelyn wiped her tears and pressed forward.

She couldn't just wait helplessly!

She had to find Dominic herself!

She needed to tell him she'd never ascended this cursed mountain! Needed to scream that even if she had, he shouldn't have risked everything to follow!

Where was the brilliant strategist she knew?

What happened to his famous intellect?

His reason?

Had it all vanished like smoke? Through blurred vision, Evelyn pushed deeper into the unknown darkness.
###Chapter 109

A faint shimmer in the distance suddenly caught Evelyn's eye.

She raised her phone, directing its beam toward the mysterious glint.

There, at the base of the steep ravine, lay the unmistakable outline of a motionless figure.

"Dominic!"

Evelyn's piercing scream echoed through the night as she dropped to her knees, scrambling toward the edge.

"I'm coming, Dominic! Hold on! You're going to be alright... Just stay with me!"

Her desperate cries alerted the security detail. "Did you locate him?" shouted one guard from above.

"Yes! He's down there! Bleeding badly!" Evelyn choked back a sob as she shouted. "Hurry!"

Without hesitation, she leaped into the ravine.

Her ankle twisted upon landing, sending sharp pain shooting up her leg.

Brushing away tears, she crawled toward Dominic's prone form and gathered him into her arms.

"Dominic! Open your eyes! Don't you dare close them!"

His skin felt like ice against her fingertips. She pressed her warm cheek against his, breathing warmth onto his face.

The mountaintop offered no cell reception.

No possibility of calling reinforcements.

As the Blackwood family guard hoisted Dominic onto his back, Evelyn limped behind, using a broken branch as a crutch. Silent tears carved paths through the dirt on her face.

How had things gone so wrong?

Who had told Dominic she was on this godforsaken mountain?

This wasn't an accident - it was premeditated murder!

Had Dominic fallen into one of the deeper crevices, no one would have found him before hypothermia set in.

The realization that she'd nearly lost him - because of her - made fresh tears burn her eyes.

After Dominic's rescue, two Veritas Capital security personnel entered Tristan's suite at Mooncrest Manor.

"We waited at the summit as instructed," reported one guard. "But he collapsed before reaching us."

Tristan slammed his fist against the antique desk. "Pathetic! Can't even climb a fucking hill! Why couldn't he just die in that ravine?!"

"Pure luck, sir. We checked the drop zone - had it been one of the narrower ravines, his body might never have been recovered."

Rubbing his temples, Tristan growled, "What happens on this mountain stays on this mountain. Now get out!"

Once alone, Tristan retrieved his key and entered Bianca's locked chambers.

Bianca's swollen, bloodshot eyes burned with hatred.

"You murdered him, didn't you? Is this your idea of setting me free?" Her voice cracked. "Did you think for one second I wouldn't follow him into death?"

A kitchen knife trembled in her white-knuckled grip.

One word confirming Dominic's death, and that blade would find her own heart.

"He lives. Against all odds." Tristan's expression darkened. "When he wakes, I'll be his first target. You need to leave, Bianca."

The knife clattered to the floor.

"Why couldn't you stop? Listen to me, Tristan - you'll never win against Dominic Blackwood. Some battles aren't meant to be fought."

With a bitter laugh, Bianca snatched her purse and stormed out.

One week later, Thornfield Industries officially declared bankruptcy, commencing liquidation proceedings.

Having never accepted her father's inheritance, Evelyn remained untouched by Richard's debts.

When the news broke, Vincent's text arrived: [Rot in hell for this.]

She powered off her phone without responding.

Some battles weren't worth fighting.

She had neither the time nor energy for petty vengeance.

Dominic's leg injuries proved severe.

Doctors confirmed he'd require the wheelchair again after discharge.

Evelyn never visited.

Not by choice - the Blackwood security detail barred all visitors at his hospital door.

Updates came only through Mrs. Wilkins, who reported Dominic's worsening temperament upon waking.

He refused all conversation and visitors.

All Evelyn could do was wait - wait for the day he'd be ready to see her again.
###Chapter 110

Evelyn found herself tucked away in the quiet corner of Ravenswood University's library after grabbing a quick dinner at the campus cafe.

A sudden burst of excited chatter made her glance up from her medical textbook.

"It's snowing! First snowfall this winter! And it's coming down hard! Let's go make snow angels!"

"Wait for me! I need to capture this for Instagram!"

Within minutes, half the library emptied out.

Curious, Evelyn walked to the frost-kissed window, watching delicate snowflakes pirouette from the heavens.

The scene was breathtakingly beautiful.

No wonder there was that romantic saying about confessions during first snowfall being destined to succeed.

Beautiful things did have a way of lifting spirits.

"Your phone's vibrating," a soft voice interrupted as someone tapped Evelyn's shoulder gently.

She blinked, snapping out of her reverie. "Oh! Thank you."

Hobbling slightly, she made her way back to her study carrel.

Evelyn had stubbornly delayed getting proper treatment for her swollen ankle.

Now the stubborn injury was taking its sweet time healing.

Still, she refused to let it slow her down.

She grabbed her buzzing phone, her breath catching when she saw the caller ID.

After the brief conversation, Evelyn's face transformed - eyes sparkling, lips stretching into an incredulous smile.

The radiant expression remained even after she ended the call.

Could this be her lucky break?

Maybe someone up there was finally looking out for her.

With trembling hands, Evelyn shoved her books into her bag and hurried toward the exit as fast as her injured foot allowed.

Her phone rang again just as she pushed through the heavy library doors.

"Evelyn! Tell me you're not still buried in books during the first snow!" Sophie's cheerful voice chimed through the phone.

"Sophie! I'm going to grad school!" Evelyn blurted out.

"What?! Since when?" Sophie's shocked squeal made Evelyn hold the phone away from her ear. "You swore you weren't continuing! What changed overnight?"

"Do you know Professor Sebastian Whitmore?"

"Should I?" Sophie asked. "Some hotshot researcher?"

"The hottest! He's my academic idol! His assistant just called... said the professor wants me in his program..." Evelyn's voice cracked with emotion. "This is everything I've ever wanted... I can't believe he chose me..."

Sophie practically vibrated with excitement for her best friend.

"I've always told you you were destined for greatness! Finally believing me now? Where are you? We're celebrating tonight!"

Evelyn's head spun with exhilaration. Wiping happy tears, she laughed. "All I want right now is my bed. I'm exhausted. Rain check on celebrations?"

"Still not sleeping well?" Sophie's tone softened. "Adrian mentioned Dominic was discharged today. Don't worry about him - with his army of helpers, he'll be back to his brooding self in no time."

"I know," Evelyn murmured.

It wasn't his recovery that weighed on her, but the crushing guilt.

If not for her, he never would have been on that hill.

After hanging up, Sophie turned to Adrian with a sigh. "Evelyn's continuing her studies. Probably overseas. That professor she mentioned teaches at an international med school..."

"Good for her," Adrian said simply. "I'm sure Dominic would approve."

"Then why won't he see her?" Sophie huffed. "She's the one who found him after his fall... It's not like she pushed him. Why punish her?"

Adrian simply pulled Sophie closer as they continued their stroll through the swirling snowflakes.
###Chapter 111

"I don't believe Dominic is avoiding Evelyn because he's upset," Adrian said thoughtfully. "His bodyguard mentioned his face is covered in scratches from the fall. A man as proud as him wouldn't want anyone seeing him like that."

Sophie's eyes widened. "That makes sense! I should tell Evelyn before she spirals into overthinking." She quickly sent Evelyn a text, relaying what Adrian had shared.

Evelyn replied with a simple heart emoji.

Sophie: [Dominic's birthday is in two weeks. Any gift ideas?]

Evelyn: [Not yet. I'm clueless.]

Sophie: [Since winter's here, why not knit him a sweater?]

Evelyn: [Seriously? Who even wears handmade sweaters anymore?]

Sophie: [Trust me, men love that kind of thing.]

Evelyn: [Problem is, I don’t know how to knit!]

Sophie: [The yarn shop will teach you! Or just watch tutorials. You're smart—you'll figure it out.]

Evelyn: [Why are you so insistent on this?]

Sophie: [Because it works! Adrian still cherishes a sweater his first love made him years ago. Drives me crazy, but I refuse to knit him one myself!]

Evelyn stood frozen in the snow, staring at her phone in disbelief.

A cab pulled up, snapping her back to reality.

An hour later, she arrived at Clara’s apartment, clutching a bag of yarn.

Clara raised an eyebrow. "Knitting a scarf?"

Evelyn’s cheeks flushed. "Actually… a sweater."

Clara smirked. "For whom? Don’t tell me it’s for Dominic?"

"It’s for you, Mom," Evelyn lied, then quickly added, "But since his birthday’s first, I’ll practice on his. Yours will be better."

Clara laughed. "I’m teasing! I didn’t know knitting sweaters was still a thing. Thought that trend died with my generation."

"Sophie swears by it."

"Guess old trends really do come back," Clara mused. "Need help? It’s time-consuming."

Evelyn shook her head. "I’ve got two weeks. I’ll manage."

Dominic sat in his wheelchair on the balcony, watching the snow fall.

His mind had been numb for days, his heart hollow.

The pain that once consumed him had dulled into silence.

He didn’t want visitors. Didn’t want noise.

The only thought that pierced the fog was when his aching body reminded him of how close he’d come to death.

And the realization that nothing would have changed.

The world would keep turning.

Those who mourned him would move on.

No one was irreplaceable.

Yet, there was still one thing he couldn’t release.

He had to stay alive.

His grip tightened on the wheelchair, knuckles whitening.

A single tear slipped free, tracing a cold path down his cheek.

Eleanor sat in the living room, the doctor standing beside her.

"I’m afraid the accident has triggered a relapse of Dominic’s depression," the doctor said quietly.

Eleanor sighed. "I suspected as much. He won’t speak to anyone. He’s shut himself away completely."
###Chapter 112

"I've prescribed medication, but he refuses to take it," the doctor said with a deep frown. "His condition won't improve if he keeps rejecting treatment."

"I'll speak with him tomorrow," Eleanor replied sharply.

"I heard Miss Thorne has influence over him. Perhaps we should—"

"Out of the question!" Eleanor snapped, her voice laced with fury. "She's the reason my son is in this state. That woman is nothing but a curse!"

The doctor wisely chose not to argue further.

His sole concern was Dominic's health.

"I know you didn't mean to side with her..." Eleanor added, forcing a conciliatory tone. "Let's see if he listens to me tomorrow."

All she wanted was her son's swift recovery.

Everything else could wait.

After her shower, Evelyn stood by the window, gazing at the winter landscape outside.

The freshly fallen snow glittered like crushed diamonds under the moonlight.

An inexplicable urge surged within her.

She reached for her phone, fingers itching to call Dominic.

She longed to hear his voice.

But hesitation won. Fearing he might ignore her call, she opted for a voice message instead.

Even if she couldn't hear him, she wanted him to know she was thinking of him.

The message sent, Evelyn moved to the living room, retrieving her knitting supplies.

Silence enveloped her as she lost herself in the rhythmic motion of the needles.

Dominic jolted awake, drenched in cold sweat.

His breathing came in ragged gasps, eyes wild with lingering terror.

The nightmares had become relentless—visions of his own decaying corpse, flesh peeling away to reveal grotesque ruin.

Each night, he watched himself rot, swarmed by insects feasting on his remains.

The self-loathing deepened with every waking.

Blindly groping for his phone, he checked the time.

His thumb accidentally brushed a notification—Evelyn's profile photo glowing on the screen.

Hands trembling, he opened the message and pressed play.

"It's snowing, Dominic. Have you seen? I heard you're home now. Get well soon! I wanted to call, but didn't want to disturb you. Here's how it looks from my window!"

The attached photo showed a pristine snowscape, moonlight dancing across crystalline drifts.

Something in his chest tightened. For a fleeting moment, the revulsion faded.

He replayed her message obsessively, letting her voice—soft as falling snow—chase away the demons.

One week later, Dominic arrived at Blackwood Group headquarters.

Seated in his wheelchair, a cashmere throw draped over his lap, he radiate icy authority.

Only the wheelchair hinted at his recent brush with death.

Nathan Cross, his assistant, immediately launched into the day's agenda.

Once briefed, Nathan asked, "Your usual coffee, sir? Or perhaps something lighter?"

"Coffee," Dominic replied. Then, eyes darkening: "Send Bianca to my office."

###Chapter 113

"Yes, sir," Nathan responded.

Moments later, a steaming cup of coffee was placed before Dominic.

As Nathan stepped out, he nearly collided with Bianca approaching the office.

Her face was bare of makeup, her usual polished appearance replaced by exhaustion.

Nathan hesitated, opening his mouth as if to speak, but ultimately remained silent.

Bianca entered Dominic's office and closed the door firmly behind her.

"I'm sorry, Dominic," she rasped, standing before his desk. "This was all my brother's doing. He knew you were still recovering, yet he deliberately sent you up that treacherous hill. We never go there ourselves—he wanted you dead."

Dominic studied her pale features before replying, "I know."

"He won't apologize. He's already fled the country," Bianca continued, voice thick with emotion. "Please... spare my family. My father is aging, and I fear the backlash would destroy him. If punishment is necessary, take it out on me. I'll accept whatever you decide without protest."

Dominic regarded her with an unfamiliar intensity.

This was a side of Bianca he'd never seen before—no flawless makeup, no carefully curated perfection.

"I acknowledge your years of loyalty," he finally said, his tone detached. "Resign from Blackwood Group and disappear from my life. Do this, and your family remains untouched."

Tears spilled down Bianca's cheeks as the finality of his words sank in.

It was over.

Everything between them—finished.

She inhaled sharply, attempting to compose herself, but the tears refused to stop.

One last, lingering look at Dominic, then she turned and fled the office.

Once Bianca's footsteps faded, Lucas entered.

Knowing Dominic wouldn't tolerate any mention of Bianca, he cut straight to business.

"Your birthday's next week. If you don't want a hotel event, we could arrange something intimate at home."

Dominic took a slow sip of coffee. "Unnecessary."

He despised crowds and never celebrated his birthday.

"But Evelyn already prepared your gift," Lucas countered. "How will she give it to you without a gathering? And it's not something money can buy." He watched Dominic's reaction carefully.

Dominic tried to maintain indifference, but his eyes betrayed interest.

"She knitted you a sweater! Worked day and night to finish it in time," Lucas pressed. "When has any woman ever handmade you clothing? Don't you want to see it?"

Dominic typically avoided sweaters—found them cumbersome.

The laborious process of knitting one seemed downright absurd.

Yet he'd never call Evelyn absurd.

If she gifted him a sweater, he'd wear it.

"I know you hate crowds," Lucas amended. "Just lunch with a few close friends."

Dominic frowned, and Lucas quickly added, "Evelyn will be there, of course. She made the gift—she'll definitely come. Your place or a restaurant?"

"Restaurant."

"Consider it done. Should I inform Evelyn, or will you?"

"You handle it."

Lucas stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Haven't you two spoken at all? Adrian mentioned she kept asking to visit you—"

"She never came." Dominic's voice turned rough with suppressed emotion.

Lucas hadn't realized Dominic had been waiting for Evelyn to reach out first.

"She was probably consumed with knitting your sweater! It's her first attempt at knitting, and not an easy task..." Lucas mused before adding impulsively, "Since you hate sweaters, maybe I could—"

"You're mistaken," Dominic interrupted smoothly. "I adore sweaters."
###Chapter 114

Dominic was clearly lying, yet Lucas had no rebuttal.

In all their years of acquaintance, Lucas had never once witnessed Dominic wearing a knitted sweater.

Though perhaps a sweater handcrafted by Evelyn carried far more sentimental value than any store-bought luxury.

"Your mother called," Lucas mentioned casually. "She said your nephew was released from St. Elizabeth Medical Center. She's expecting you for dinner tonight."

"She could've told me herself," Dominic replied tersely.

"Did something happen between you two? She sounded unusually cautious earlier." Lucas studied his friend's stony expression. "Don't be too hard on Eleanor, Dominic. A mother's love is irreplaceable."

"Enough."

Lucas chuckled at his friend's irritation.

"Shall I inform Evelyn about dinner at Mooncrest Manor?"

Dominic considered this briefly. "Didn't you say she's preoccupied with her knitting project?"

"Right! Only seven days left now. I wonder how that sweater's coming along."

When Dominic arrived at the family estate that evening, Eleanor practically glowed with delight.

The other occupants, however, wore varying degrees of wariness.

Dominic's icy stare landed squarely on Victoria.

"This is Evelyn's sister, Victoria Thorne," Eleanor hastily explained under her son's piercing gaze. "I wasn't fond of her initially, but she's been tending to Julian since his injury..."

Victoria squirmed beneath Dominic's unrelenting scrutiny.

Summoning courage, she offered a tentative smile. "Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Blackwood. I'm Evelyn's half-sister. I assumed you'd bring her tonight."

Dominic ignored her completely, shifting his attention to Julian's gaunt, lethargic features.

His hospital stay had clearly been torturous.

"I ended things with Evelyn six months ago, Uncle Dominic," Julian rushed to explain. "She despises me after discovering my relationship with Victoria. I'd never scheme to manipulate her into staying with you."

"Obviously," Dominic replied dryly. After a beat, he added, "You lack the capability to control Evelyn Thorne."

Evelyn's fiercely independent nature made her ungovernable by anyone.

"Mock me all you like. Whatever makes you happy," Julian said meekly.

"I'd be happier if you stopped speaking," Dominic retorted.

Julian fell silent.

Though his finger reattachment surgery succeeded, full recovery remained distant. He still required Victoria's assistance to eat.

The dinner progressed with palpable tension.

Attempting to diffuse the atmosphere, Victoria ventured, "We once consulted a renowned fortune teller about Evelyn's future. They predicted she'd bring misfortune to her husband... Your recent accident was probably—"

Dominic's glacial glare cut through her words like shards of ice.

"I possess some divination skills myself," he said softly. "Allow me to predict your future... It will be brief."

Victoria's fork clattered against the fine china.

Recognizing her son's dangerous mood, Eleanor summoned security. "Remove her from the premises!"

Julian protested his companion's ejection. "Grandmother—"

"Quiet! Feed yourself or go hungry! I never approved of that girl! She'll only bring you ruin!"

Julian wordlessly struggled with his injured hand to grasp his utensils.

Dominic produced a check from his jacket, sliding it across the table to Gregory. "For Mother's expenses."

Since Eleanor resided with Gregory, Dominic regularly provided financial support.

Gregory hesitated.

While needing the funds, accepting them stung his pride. Caring for their mother should be duty, not transaction.

###Chapter 115

The scars from Julian’s past dealings with loan sharks had left Gregory Blackwood no choice but to pay an exorbitant sum to settle the debts.

"Since Dominic is offering, just take it!" Beatrice Thorne interjected sharply. "We're family, after all. There's no need for formalities with him."

Gregory’s face flushed with embarrassment. He picked up the check with stiff fingers and muttered, "You don’t have to do this again, Dominic."

"I'm finished eating," Dominic said coolly. "I'll take my leave now."

Eleanor Blackwood stood and walked him out.

The moment the door closed behind them, Julian’s fork clattered loudly against the floor.

"Father! How could you accept his money?!"

Humiliation burned through him.

He despised being pitied—treated like some charity case.

"You ungrateful brat!" Gregory roared, veins bulging in his neck. "If you’re so proud, pay back every cent I spent clearing your debts!"

Beatrice joined in, her voice dripping with scorn. "Your uncle may look down on us, but that’s no reason to turn down free money! Do you even realize how much he just handed us? Eight hundred thousand dollars! Your father’s company wouldn’t earn that in a year!"

Julian’s bloodshot eyes widened. "Are things really that bad?"

"What did you expect?" Beatrice sighed. "Most of our clients only worked with us as favors to Dominic. They pulled out months ago…" Her lips twisted bitterly. "At least Victoria has no idea about our situation. I doubt she’d be so eager to take care of you if she knew we’re barely scraping by."

The revelation hit Julian like a physical blow.

His injured hand clenched into a fist, but the pain was nothing compared to the crushing weight of reality.

He had been living in a delusion—one that was now shattering around him.

The morning of Dominic’s birthday arrived swiftly.

Evelyn Thorne woke early, double-checked the gift she had prepared, and began getting ready.

Across the city, Dominic stood before his closet, deliberating.

A sweater over a dress shirt wouldn’t do.

What if the one Evelyn made was fitted?

By ten, they both arrived at the restaurant—early, thanks to Lucas Grant’s urgent calls insisting the other guests had already arrived.

Except there were no other guests.

Evelyn stole a glance at Dominic.

The bruises on his face had faded, leaving only the sharp angles of his striking features.

His legs remained hidden beneath the wheelchair, but his attire—just a simple t-shirt and light jacket—made him look unexpectedly approachable.

As she studied him, Dominic’s gaze swept over her.

The light makeup didn’t quite conceal the shadows under her eyes.

She had truly poured herself into knitting that sweater.

"I made this for you…" Evelyn hesitated, then held out the paper bag. "I wasn’t sure about your size, so I made it a little loose."

Dominic took the bag, his fingers brushing against the thick, cream-colored fabric as he pulled it out.

The weight of the yarn promised warmth.

Without a word, he shrugged off his jacket and pulled the sweater on right there.

Evelyn’s cheeks warmed.

Not only had he not mocked her gift—he was wearing it immediately.

"Happy birthday, Dominic Blackwood."

###Chapter 116

Dominic gazed up at Evelyn’s face, his voice rough with emotion. "Thank you."

The sweater was softer than he’d imagined, wrapping him in unexpected warmth.

Evelyn couldn’t tear her eyes away.

Was it the craftsmanship of the knit, or was it simply him? She reached for the paper bag and pulled out another gift.

"Just in case you didn’t like the sweater," she said, offering the small box.

Dominic studied it, silent.

"It’s a lighter," she explained. "I wasn’t sure what else to get you, but this seemed practical. Though you really shouldn’t smoke so much. It’s terrible for you."

She pressed the box into his hands.

He flicked it open, drew out the silver lighter, and sparked a flame.

"I don’t smoke often," he murmured, his voice low. "Only when I’m stressed."

Evelyn arched a brow. "You smoked constantly when I lived with you."

"That’s because you were constantly driving me insane," he countered.

She had no retort for that.

"Let’s get some air," Dominic suggested.

The restaurant’s heat was stifling, beads of sweat forming at his temples.

"Of course. Let me help." She moved behind his wheelchair.

"It’s electric," he said, pressing a button to glide forward effortlessly.

Evelyn kept pace beside him. "You always had your bodyguards push you before."

"No reason to when they were there to do it."

"I could help too—"

"It’s fine."

"I want to," she insisted, gripping the handles and steering him outside.

The cold night air rushed over them.

"How are your legs? What did the doctors say?"

"Right one’s bruised. Left one’s broken."

Her chest tightened.

"Did it hurt badly?"

"Manageable."

She wheeled him to the sidewalk, then draped her coat over his legs.

"Why didn’t you reply to my message?" she finally asked, the words spilling out.

She’d lost sleep over his silence.

Their faces were close, breaths mingling in the frosty air.

Dominic didn’t want to admit he’d spiraled into a relapse, that antidepressants had only recently stabilized him.

When Lucas mentioned Evelyn was knitting him a sweater, he hadn’t wanted to disturb her.

"Never mind," she said quickly. "It was just an impulsive text—first snow of the year and all."

She stood abruptly, repositioning herself behind the wheelchair to push him down the street.

"Why didn’t you visit me?" Dominic asked suddenly.

"Adrian said you were too proud. I thought you wouldn’t want me seeing you until your face healed."

"You only texted once."

"You didn’t answer. I assumed you didn’t want to hear from me."

"I did," he rasped.

Evelyn’s pulse jumped. "What? Dominic, what did you—"

He cut her off, pointing ahead. "There’s a bakery. I want cake."

The diversion worked.

"Oh! Let’s get some," she agreed, then hesitated. "But you hate sweets."

"It’s my birthday. Exceptions are allowed."

"True. Birthdays should be special."

Inside, the shop assistant greeted them warmly. Dominic glanced at Evelyn. "You choose."

"How about mousse? Buttercream might be too heavy."

Dominic turned to the assistant. "Mousse, please."

"Of course, sir. What size?"

He looked back at Evelyn. "How many people are coming to the party?"
###Chapter 117

"I'm not sure," Dominic murmured, his deep voice barely above a whisper. "Don't concern yourself with them."

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Then let's get a massive one! Twelve inches perhaps?"

Dominic turned to the bakery assistant without hesitation. "Twelve inches."

"Absolutely! Are you two celebrating something special? You make such a lovely couple," the assistant gushed, her smile widening.

A rosy flush crept up Evelyn's neck, painting her porcelain cheeks crimson.

Meanwhile, Dominic's attention drifted to the pastry display. "Would you like to select something additional to take home?"

"That's alright..." Evelyn began.

"Choose something for your mother." Dominic's ears turned pink as he spoke.

Noticing his rare display of shyness, Evelyn suppressed a giggle. "Alright then! I'll pick something."

They departed the bakery an hour later.

Dominic carried the oversized cake box with visible discomfort.

The streets were nearly deserted.

Though winter's chill hung in the air, an inexplicable warmth enveloped them both.

Upon entering Villa Serenade's private dining room, all conversation ceased abruptly.

Dominic's cream cashmere sweater softened his usual imposing presence.

The cake box in his arms seemed utterly foreign to his image.

Everyone knew Dominic Blackwood never indulged in sweets.

Lucas cleared his throat dramatically as he approached. "You went cake shopping? I brought one too, though not nearly as grand."

Under the weight of curious stares, Evelyn shifted uncomfortably. "He suddenly craved cake, so we made a stop."

Lucas choked on air. "Dominic wanted cake?"

"Indeed," Evelyn confirmed. "Is everyone present? I'll prepare the cake then."

As Evelyn moved away, Lucas reached for Dominic's sweater. "Incredibly soft. Miss Thorne has excellent taste. Aren't you overheating? Let me help you—"

Dominic swatted Lucas' hand away with a glare. "Don't."

Undeterred, Lucas grinned and guided Dominic to his seat.

After Evelyn positioned the cake, Lucas signaled the waitstaff to begin service.

Dominic methodically arranged candles atop the frosting.

The room held its collective breath.

Since when did Dominic Blackwood participate in birthday rituals?

Hadn't he famously declared birthdays pointless?

Yet here he was, meticulously placing each candle with unexpected enthusiasm.

Once satisfied, Dominic produced a silver lighter.

The flickering flame held everyone mesmerized.

"Isn't this usually done after dark?" Evelyn whispered.

Lucas strode to the windows, drawing the heavy drapes. "Nonsense! Any time is perfect when Dominic desires it!"

Darkness swallowed the room instantly.

Lucas, ever attuned to Dominic's moods, observed the lighter with interest. "Is that new? Might I borrow it?"

Dominic pocketed the item protectively. "Evelyn gave it to me."

"Two gifts, Miss Thorne? How thoughtful," Lucas teased.

Evelyn's cheeks burned.

"Shall we sing?" she suggested hastily.

Her clear voice began the familiar melody, soon joined by others.

As the song concluded, Dominic closed his eyes to make his wish.

Evelyn studied his chiseled features illuminated by candlelight, wondering what secret desire filled his heart.

###Chapter 118

Moments later, Dominic's eyelids fluttered open as he blew out the flickering candles on the birthday cake.

The heavy drapes were suddenly drawn aside, flooding the dim room with golden afternoon light.

"What did you wish for, Dominic?" Lucas asked with an impish grin, leaning forward eagerly.

"Do you make a habit of sharing birthday wishes with everyone?" Dominic countered smoothly.

The room erupted in good-natured laughter.

Dominic carefully sliced a generous portion of cake and placed it before Evelyn with deliberate care.

"You should have the first piece," Evelyn protested, gently pushing the plate back toward him.

His lips curved slightly. "I couldn't possibly eat all that."

Picking up a silver fork, he took a small bite before sliding the plate back to her with an intimate gesture that didn't go unnoticed.

They might as well have been alone in that crowded room, so absorbed were they in their private moment.

The gathered executives immediately began catcalling and teasing.

"Should we start addressing Miss Thorne as Mrs. Blackwood now?"

"Go ahead and try! I don't think our CEO would object!"

Exclusive material by NovelDrama.Org.

Laughter rippled through the group. "Miss Thorne wouldn't mind either, would she?"

Evelyn's pale skin flushed crimson from her neck to the tips of her ears, the heat of embarrassment radiating off her.

"That's enough," Dominic commanded, though his tone lacked its usual sharpness.

"Right, right... Let's have some cake!" someone quickly amended.

The elaborate cake was whisked away to be portioned and distributed among the guests.

As the last crumbs disappeared, servers began bringing in the main courses for lunch.

"Care for some wine, Miss Thorne?" Lucas offered, holding up an expensive-looking bottle.

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "Just water for me, thank you."

"Nonsense! At least have some juice or milk?"

"Water is perfect," she insisted, pressing fingers to her temples.

A wave of dizziness washed over her - likely from waking before dawn that morning.

The cloying scent of alcohol permeating the room from multiple open bottles wasn't helping matters.

After pouring Evelyn a crystal glass of ice water, Lucas noticed her untouched plate.

"Feeling uncomfortable, Miss Thorne? Don't be. We've all known Dominic for years - we're practically family!" he said warmly, trying to put her at ease.

Evelyn lifted heavy-lidded eyes. "It's not that. I'm just a bit tired after all the excitement."

Lucas immediately stood. "Let me show you to a guest room where you can rest."

Before Evelyn could respond, Dominic's hand closed over hers on the table. His piercing gaze locked onto Lucas. "I'll take her."

Someone promptly yanked Lucas back into his seat amid raucous laughter.

"Don't forget to come back!" Lucas called after them, half-laughing. "I still plan to drink you under the table, Dominic!"

Evelyn gently extracted her hand from Dominic's warm grasp. "A server can escort me. You should stay with your guests."

"I'm taking you," Dominic stated in that tone that brooked no argument.

There was something different about him since the accident, Evelyn realized.

Where she once bristled at his controlling nature, she now found herself unable - perhaps unwilling - to refuse him.

Somehow she knew that no matter how intimidating he appeared, he would never harm her.

Pushing his wheelchair through the doorway, they left the boisterous gathering behind.

"Who knew our ice-cold CEO could be so attentive?" someone marveled once they'd gone.

"He just hadn't met the right woman before Evelyn Thorne came along. She's got him completely bewitched!"

"Or perhaps it's the other way around? How many women these days would hand-knit a sweater for a man?"

Lucas interrupted the speculation with a dramatic sigh. "They're clearly smitten with each other. Dominic's fallen hard, and Evelyn's starting to return his feelings... Though if she were truly selfish, Thornfield Industries wouldn't have collapsed. Dominic offered her three hundred million to save it, and she refused. Could any of you turn down that kind of money?"

A chorus of emphatic headshakes answered him.

"No wonder the boss is so taken with her. Where else would he find a woman who treats money like it's worthless?"

"Watch your language! We're eating here!"

Lucas grinned mischievously. "Let's place bets on whether Dominic returns to lunch. I say he won't!"

The unanimous agreement made betting pointless - no one would take the opposite position.
###Chapter 119

At the threshold of the guest suite, Evelyn murmured, "I'll escort you back first. I need to rest for a while myself. I'll come find you after I wake."

Dominic wheeled into the room, his voice weary. "I'm exhausted too."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

"You haven't eaten anything! You should go have dinner—"

"Forget it. Just rest."

How could Evelyn possibly forget?

Letting him go hungry on his birthday twisted her stomach with guilt.

She dashed back to the private dining area to prepare a plate for Dominic.

The gathered guests eagerly assisted her.

"Take more meat, Miss Thorne! Make sure he finishes every bite! He's become so thin lately."

"We're counting on you to look after our boss, Miss Thorne!"

"Rest well after your meal. We won't disturb you at all!"

Cheeks burning, Evelyn carried the laden tray back to their suite.

Dominic was engrossed in his phone when she entered.

She set the food before him with careful precision.

"Aren't you going to remove that sweater? You're perspiring," she observed, fingers twisting nervously. "I shouldn't have chosen such heavy yarn."

Dominic locked his phone and peeled off the knitted garment.

"It'll serve as an overcoat."

Evelyn took the sweater, her fingers brushing against his briefly, before hanging it in the closet.

"I brought you plenty of food," she said, perching on the edge of the bed. "Please eat as much as you can."

Her gaze traced the sharp angles of his back through his dress shirt.

He had indeed lost considerable weight, while her own curves had grown more pronounced with each passing week.

Five months pregnant now.

Her appetite had become insatiable. Though she monitored her diet carefully, the twins growing within her demanded constant nourishment.

Evelyn had intended to help Dominic settle after his meal, but exhaustion claimed her before he finished.

When Dominic finally joined her, he found her deep in slumber.

For long moments, he simply watched the rhythmic rise and fall of her breathing, unable to resist tracing the curve of her cheek with featherlight fingertips.

Evelyn awoke to darkness pressing against the windows.

She bolted upright, finding Dominic's obsidian eyes watching her intently from his wheelchair.

Heat flooded her face. "You...you weren't watching me sleep this whole time, were you?"

A faint pink tinged Dominic's ears.

"Are you hungry?" he deflected. "It's seven. I told them to proceed with dinner without us. We'll dine elsewhere."

Evelyn agreed, slipping into the bathroom to splash cool water on her face.

Night had descended upon Ravenswood with a biting chill.

The cold seeped into Evelyn's bones as she guided Dominic's wheelchair through the quiet streets.

"Let's get ribs!" she suggested brightly.

"Whatever you wish," Dominic acquiesced.

Though the sidewalks stood nearly empty, the glow of restaurant windows promised warmth and sustenance.

Evelyn's stomach growled loudly—she'd missed lunch entirely.

"Oh! Cotton candy!" she exclaimed, spotting a vendor's cart. "Wait here—I haven't had any in ages!"

Dominic's lips curved at her childlike enthusiasm.

Moments later, Evelyn returned triumphant, clutching the pink cloud of sugar.

Then—movement.

A sleek black sedan accelerating dangerously.

Aiming directly for Dominic.

The cotton candy tumbled forgotten to the pavement as Evelyn launched herself forward, her scream slicing through the frosty air—

"DOMINIC! MOVE!"

###Chapter 120

The deafening crack of gunfire shattered the night's silence, instantly followed by the ear-splitting screech of tires.

Evelyn clutched Dominic's arm so tightly her knuckles turned white. Her entire body trembled uncontrollably as hot tears streaked down her pale cheeks.

The black sedan's tires had been blown out.

It veered violently before smashing into the cotton candy stall where Evelyn had made her purchase moments earlier.

Dominic's protective embrace tightened around her as his sharp gaze tracked the wrecked vehicle.

Someone had tried to assassinate him—and failed spectacularly.

Another gunshot rang out.

This bullet found its mark in the driver's seat.

Screams erupted around them as panicked bystanders scrambled for cover. The festive atmosphere had turned to chaos in seconds.

Evelyn's skin felt icy beneath Dominic's touch.

Cradling her face between his hands, he rasped, "Look at me. It's over." His thumbs brushed away her tears.

Her chest heaved with ragged breaths. Fear and confusion swirled in her wide eyes, but she couldn't tear her gaze from his face.

"Dominic... Dominic..."

A thousand words lodged in her throat, but only his name escaped her quivering lips.

"Still breathing, sweetheart."

He pressed her trembling palm against his cheek. "Feel that? Warm. Alive."

She nodded mutely, fresh tears spilling over.

"I thought—" Her voice broke. "I couldn't bear it if—"

"Death needs an engraved invitation to claim me." His fingers intertwined with hers. "Now let's get those ribs before the kitchen closes."

Evelyn gripped his wheelchair handles and propelled them into the nearest restaurant at record speed.

They'd barely settled at their table when Lucas burst in with security detail.

"Christ, Blackwood!" Lucas dropped into the adjacent chair. "When I heard those shots—"

"Save the dramatics." Dominic speared a juicy rib and placed it on Evelyn's plate. "Eat."

Color was slowly returning to her cheeks.

"Who...?" She glanced between the men.

That sedan would've plowed through them if not for the timely tire explosion.

"Enhanced security protocol after last month's incident," Lucas explained. "We had snipers positioned on surrounding rooftops."

"Oh."

"You must be shaken, Miss Thorne." Lucas pushed a steaming bowl toward her. "Chicken soup for the nerves."

"My appetite's gone."

The delicious aromas that had made her stomach growl earlier now turned it sour.

"Figured as much." Lucas chuckled. "Car's outside when you're ready."

Dominic's intense gaze locked onto Evelyn.

"What?" She fidgeted under his scrutiny.

Instead of answering, he pulled out his phone and began typing.

Evelyn's phone vibrated seconds later.

Her breath hitched as she read:

[Curious about my birthday wish?]

The device practically burned her fingertips. They were sitting three feet apart!

She dared not look up, hyperaware of their audience.

Evelyn: [Depends on the wish.]

Dominic: [I wished you'd come home with me.]

Her brows knitted in confusion.

Dominic: [Not for dinner. For good.]

The message glowed on her screen like a live wire.

###Chapter 121 

Evelyn placed her phone face down on the marble tabletop.

Her throat tightened unexpectedly. She reached for the bowl of soup Lucas had handed her earlier. Lucas rapped his knuckles against the wood surface.

"Seriously?" His voice carried across the dining table. "You two think we don't notice your secret texting?"

Evelyn's pulse quickened. Dominic had that dangerous glint in his eyes - the one that usually preceded some outrageous declaration. "We're finished eating," she blurted out. "We should be going."

Lucas smirked. "Yeah, we're stuffed too. Stuffed from watching your little lovefest."

Eleanor Blackwood arrived at the Blackwood estate in a flurry of panic after hearing about the assassination attempt on her son.

Her expression hardened when she saw Evelyn standing in the foyer.

"Miss Thorne threw herself in front of Mr. Blackwood when that car came at them," the security detail reported. "Wrapped her whole body around him like a human shield."

The bodyguard shifted his weight. "If we hadn't disabled the vehicle, it would've plowed right through them both. Miss Thorne would've taken the full impact. Might've given Mr. Blackwood a fighting chance though."

Eleanor's knuckles turned white as gruesome scenarios played across her mind.

"We haven't eaten yet, Mother," Dominic interjected smoothly. "We were just about to have dinner."

Eleanor blinked. "Of course. You should eat. I'll... I'll be on my way soon."

The icy resentment she'd harbored toward Evelyn began to thaw.

True character reveals itself in moments of crisis.

Evelyn hadn't hesitated to put herself between Dominic and certain death.

If that wasn't love, Eleanor didn't know what was.

After dinner, Dominic and Evelyn stepped into the grand hallway.

Evelyn was calculating her escape route when Eleanor's voice stopped her.

"I know how to judge a person's character, Evelyn." Eleanor rose from the velvet settee. "Thank you. For tonight." She took an uncharacteristic step forward. "Let's put the past behind us. Treat my son well, and we'll have no problems. He's my only concern."

Evelyn stiffened at the unexpected olive branch.

After an awkward beat, she managed, "You should... you should get some rest."

Eleanor nodded. "Both of you should retire as well."

The heavy front door clicked shut behind Eleanor, leaving oppressive silence in its wake.

Evelyn's ballet flats suddenly felt glued to the Persian rug.

Going upstairs with Dominic now would be... problematic. But what plausible excuse could she give?

He'd made his birthday wish perfectly clear - her presence in his home tonight.

Would leaving now crush him?

"I took everything with me last time," she began hesitantly.

Dominic cut her off. "Wear something of mine." His tone brooked no argument. "We'll have your clothes cleaned by morning."

Evelyn chewed her lower lip.

"Unless you'd rather leave?" Dominic's gaze turned challenging. "I can have the car brought around."

Evelyn swallowed hard. His calm delivery somehow made the words cut deeper.

Just then, Mrs. Wilkins materialized from the shadows. "Actually, Miss Thorne, we found some of your belongings in the laundry. Let me fetch them for you."

Evelyn's last escape route evaporated.

As Mrs. Wilkins disappeared down the corridor, Evelyn moved behind Dominic's wheelchair. "Birthday boys shouldn't pout," she teased, pushing him toward the elevator.

"I'm not pouting." His voice remained even. "I won't force you to stay."

"It's not that I don't want to..."

"Then what?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I made such a dramatic exit last week. Coming back so soon feels... humiliating."

Dominic's lips twitched. "I wasn't there for your grand departure. If anything, your return is my humiliation, not yours."

The tension in Evelyn's shoulders eased slightly. "Who... who helps you with your nighttime routine now? Still that nurse from before?"

The elevator doors slid open on the second floor. Dominic tilted his head up, his eyes glinting with something unreadable.
###Chapter 122

"I'll handle it myself," Dominic responded calmly. "Though if you're concerned, you may assist."

Evelyn felt like she'd just stepped into her own trap.

Naturally she'd worry if Dominic tried to manage his hygiene needs alone, but was there really any difference between helping him shower and showering with him?

They entered the master suite, Evelyn closing the door behind them.

"Could you hand me the cane?" Dominic's deep voice rumbled.

Evelyn was about to ask its location when she spotted the polished mahogany cane and passed it to him.

Gripping the handle, Dominic used it for support as he rose unsteadily from the wheelchair.

"Are you alright?" Evelyn gasped, hands fluttering nervously.

"Perfectly fine. I've been showering independently for days," Dominic replied, amusement coloring his tone. "Did I frighten you?"

A flush crept up Evelyn's neck. "Were you teasing me deliberately?"

"Merely observing your reaction," he said before making his way toward the ensuite bathroom.

Unable to quell her concern, Evelyn found herself following.

Dominic paused at the threshold. "Planning to supervise?"

Evelyn shook her head, then quickly nodded. "I'm just... concerned. Can you manage your trousers without aggravating your injuries?"

"These are designed for ease," Dominic explained, fingers already at his belt.

Evelyn made a noncommittal sound.

As if to demonstrate, Dominic unbuckled his belt with deliberate slowness, his gaze locked with hers.

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks.

"I—I'll wait outside!" she stammered, backing away. "Call if you need anything."

She fled, shutting the bathroom door with more force than intended.

Exhaling sharply, she considered leaving but feared he might require assistance. Just then, Mrs. Wilkins knocked and entered with freshly laundered clothing.

"Is Master Dominic bathing, Madam?"

Evelyn nodded, accepting the garments.

"Does he usually... manage alone?"

"Always. Refuses any help."

"Stubborn man," Evelyn muttered.

"Indeed," Mrs. Wilkins agreed. "Master Dominic has always been that way. No matter the difficulty, he insists on handling everything himself."

Evelyn sighed. "It's one of his most frustrating qualities."

"Don't judge him harshly," Mrs. Wilkins said, her smile fading. "I don't know what he endured in his past, but beneath that exterior lies remarkable kindness."

Kindness?

An unexpected descriptor for Dominic Blackwood.

Yet not entirely inaccurate.

Mrs. Wilkins continued softly, "The doctor once told me the kindest souls often battle the darkest demons."

"He struggled with depression?" Evelyn's brows lifted.

Mrs. Wilkins nodded. "Required medication for nearly a fortnight."

A weight settled in Evelyn's chest. How little she truly knew of the complex man Dominic was - cruel yet fragile, ruthless yet tenacious.

When Dominic emerged later, his damp hair curled against the collar of his white robe as he leaned on the cane.

Evelyn moved to assist, noticing his wet locks. "How did you wash your hair?"

"Seated."

"Let me dry it," she offered, retrieving the hair dryer from the marble countertop.

As warm air flowed through his dark strands, Dominic sat motionless, his stillness almost peaceful.

Evelyn wished this moment could linger.

Suddenly, Dominic's hand encircled her wrist.

"Enough," he said.

"Oh! Right." Evelyn switched off the dryer, blinking away her reverie.

Her gaze caught on fresh blood blooming through his bandages.

"Your wounds need redressing. I'll fetch the medical kit."

After replacing the dryer, Evelyn hurried downstairs to request supplies from Mrs. Wilkins, her mind swirling with unanswered questions about the enigmatic man awaiting her return.
###Chapter 123

Evelyn stepped back into the bedroom clutching the first aid kit tightly in her hands.

Her knees hit the carpet as she knelt beside Dominic's injured legs, fingers trembling slightly as she began unwrapping the bloodied bandages.

The wounds were far worse than she'd anticipated.

A chunk of flesh was completely torn away from his thigh, exposing raw muscle tissue that glistened crimson under the lamplight...

The pain must have been excruciating.

Dominic barely flinched as Evelyn cleaned and redressed his injuries.

She noticed his jaw clenching when the antiseptic touched the open wound.

"It's just a surface wound. Doesn't hurt," he lied through gritted teeth, breaking the tense silence.

His attempt at reassurance only made her angrier.

Evelyn deliberately pressed a cotton swab against the deepest part of the wound, making Dominic suck in a sharp breath.

"Say that again," she challenged, her amber eyes glistening with unshed tears as she glared at him.

Dominic leaned back on his palms, his stormy gray eyes locking onto hers. "I said it doesn't hurt."

He was gambling that her soft heart wouldn't let her hurt him again.

The way her lower lip trembled betrayed how much his pain affected her.

"Get in bed! Doctor said you need complete bed rest for ten days minimum," Evelyn snapped, slamming the first aid kit shut before storming into the ensuite bathroom.

Dominic propped himself against the carved mahogany headboard and grabbed his phone from the nightstand.

One quick dial later, his voice turned icy. "Report."

The bullet had grazed his thigh but missed all major arteries. A calculated shot meant to maim, not kill.

His men were currently extracting information from the would-be assassin.

"Bastard's got an iron will. We'll need to escalate interrogation methods. Have answers by sunrise," the voice on the line reported.

"Keep him alive until he talks."

Dominic needed to know exactly which snake in his garden had dared to strike at him.

The car bombing six months ago had left him in a coma for weeks.

He wouldn't be caught off guard again.

Ending the call, Dominic retrieved his medication from the drawer - an assortment of painkillers, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatories.

He dry-swallowed the handful of pills before reaching for the water glass.

Just as he set it down, the bathroom door swung open.

Evelyn emerged wearing one of his oversized dress shirts, her damp hair clinging to her shoulders.

"After careful consideration, I think it's best if I sleep in the guest room tonight," she announced, avoiding his gaze. "Wouldn't want to accidentally hurt you in my sleep."

Dominic's gaze darkened. "Is that really your concern?" His voice dropped an octave. "Or are you looking for an excuse to escape me?"

Cheeks flushing, Evelyn huffed and climbed into the king-sized bed, perching stiffly on the edge.

"Happy now?" She shot him a defiant look that didn't reach her eyes.

"In your current state, it's not like you could do anything even if you wanted to," she added with false bravado.

The challenge in her eyes ignited something primal in Dominic.

In one swift motion, he tangled his fingers in her damp hair and tilted her face up.

His lips crashed against hers in a searing kiss that left them both breathless.

At 3:17 AM, Dominic reached across the bed and hauled Evelyn's sleeping form against his chest.

She'd been curled on the very edge all night, as if afraid to touch him.

Earlier attempts to pull her closer had resulted in her sleepily wriggling back to her spot.

This time, he kept his arm firmly around her waist.

Evelyn's tense body gradually melted against his.

The sudden glow of his phone screen cut through the darkness.

Dominic answered the muted call without moving his arm from around Evelyn.

"We cracked him, sir. The shooter confessed Victoria Thorne hired him. That's Miss Evelyn's half-sister."

Dominic's grip tightened imperceptibly around Evelyn.

"Your orders regarding Victoria Thorne?" The voice asked. "Prison or permanent disposal?"

Dominic pressed a featherlight kiss to Evelyn's temple before growling his response into the phone.

"Make her disappear."
###Chapter 124

The news of Victoria's suicide broke at dawn, spreading through Ravenshore City like wildfire.

She had plunged from the twentieth floor of the Oceanview Grand Hotel, her body shattering upon impact with the concrete below.

Police found Evelyn's contact information in the hotel room where Victoria had been staying.

With Richard deceased and Margaret traveling overseas, Evelyn became the only relative available to identify the remains.

The phone call jolted Evelyn awake at 7:03 a.m. Her fingers trembled as she answered.

Even after ending the call, she lay paralyzed in bed, convinced this must be some cruel nightmare.

Only when she pinched her arm hard enough to leave bruises did reality sink in.

She dressed in a frenzy, forgetting breakfast, forgetting everything except the urgent need to reach the crime scene.

Meanwhile, in his penthouse office, Dominic Blackwood received his own briefing.

"Sir, witnesses confirm she jumped voluntarily," reported Nathan Cross, his voice clinical. "The moment officers entered, she sprinted to the window. No hesitation. Pure guilt drove her over the edge."

Dominic's coffee cup paused mid-air. His eyes darkened like gathering storm clouds. "Triple surveillance on Julian Whitmore," he commanded. "Immediately."

Victoria and Julian had been inseparable.

If Victoria wanted Dominic dead, Julian certainly shared that desire.

The assassination attempt might have deeper roots than a scorned woman's revenge.

Victoria could have been merely a pawn - but a dead pawn told no tales.

Police barricades surrounded the Oceanview Grand when Evelyn arrived.

An officer escorted her past yellow tape, up the elevator, toward room V906.

"Miss Thorne," the detective said gently, "we've tentatively identified the victim as your half-sister Victoria Thorne. But we require formal confirmation." His pen tapped the notepad. "Time of death approximately 5:17 a.m."

Evelyn's throat constricted. Each breath felt like swallowing broken glass.

The metallic tang of blood hit her nostrils before they even turned the corridor.

Her stomach lurched at the crimson streaks painting the carpet.

When the coroner lifted the white sheet, Evelyn's world tilted violently.

The face staring back bore no resemblance to the beautiful, cruel sister she remembered.

Only pulped flesh and splintered bone remained.

Evelyn barely made it to the wastebasket before vomiting.

Four years of medical school hadn't prepared her for this.

Dissecting cadavers in sterile labs was nothing like confronting butchered family.

"Miss Thorne?" The officer steadied her swaying body. "Should we get you water?"

Evelyn's pulse thundered in her ears. "I...can't... Just run DNA tests. Please."

"That requires days, maybe weeks—"

"Then do it!" Her scream echoed off the walls. "That...that thing isn't Victoria!"

Tears carved hot paths down her cheeks.

This wasn't grief - not exactly.

Their relationship had been poison since childhood.

But hatred and death existed in different universes entirely.

As attendants wheeled the body away, Evelyn collapsed into a patrol car's backseat.

Her mind raced with terrible questions:

Why would Victoria choose suicide?

What final argument had she had with Julian?

And most chilling of all - was this truly a suicide at all?

###Chapter 125

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she pulled out her phone and dialed Julian's number.

The line connected after three rings.

"Evelyn? Is everything alright?" Julian's voice came through, laced with concern.

"Victoria's dead. Did you have any part in this?" Evelyn demanded, her voice sharper than intended.

A sharp intake of breath. "What the hell are you talking about? I'm at St. Elizabeth's for my annual physical... She was perfectly fine when we spoke yesterday evening!"

"Did you two argue?" Evelyn pressed.

"Of course not!" Julian snapped.

Then, after a weighted pause, his tone shifted. "Actually... I just remembered something. Victoria was here when Dominic came over for dinner last week. It was... tense. He told her she wouldn't live to see next month. She's been paranoid ever since—"

"That's absurd! I was with Dominic all night. He couldn't have—"

"God, Evelyn!" Julian interrupted with a bitter laugh. "You lose all rationality when it comes to Dominic, don't you? I'm just telling you what I witnessed. You're the only person I'd share this with. The police won't hear a word of it from me."

"Listen carefully, Julian Whitmore," Evelyn hissed. "If I find out you're involved in Victoria's death in any way—"

"It wasn't me!" Julian's voice turned icy. "What possible motive would I have? Even if we fought, murder isn't my style." A beat. Then softer: "Ever since Dominic came into your life, I've meant nothing to you."

"Spare me the victim act!" Evelyn shot back. "What exactly did I mean to you when you were screwing Victoria behind my back?" She ended the call with violent jab of her thumb.

The officer raised an eyebrow. "Who was that?"

"Julian Whitmore. Victoria Thorne's boyfriend." Evelyn recited Julian's number mechanically. "They've been inseparable lately. He must know why she..." Her voice cracked.

That afternoon, Evelyn left the police station in a daze and hailed a cab to Clara's apartment.

After breaking the news, Evelyn whispered, "I barely recognized her, Mom... There was so much blood... Her face was..." She shuddered.

Clara pulled her daughter into a fierce embrace. "Don't think about it, darling. Her choices were her own. We have our own lives to live."

"Julian implied Dominic was involved," Evelyn murmured. "But that's impossible. Dominic would never—"

"Have you asked him?" Clara interrupted gently. "Even if he was, I'm sure he had his reasons."

"Mom! There's never justification for murder! If Victoria broke the law, the authorities should—"

"And how well did that work with your uncle?" Clara countered, squeezing Evelyn's hands. "I'm not condoning murder. I'm just saying Julian might be lying."

Evelyn took a steadying breath. "I just came to tell you... I need to go. I have to see Dominic."

"Let me drive you," Clara insisted. "You're in no state—"

"I'm fine." Evelyn was already moving toward the door.

Dominic had been ordered to bed rest after last night's incident. When Evelyn arrived at Blackwood Manor at two, she found him propped up in bed, reading financial reports.

His sharp gaze took in her pallor and the shadows under her eyes. "Evelyn?"

"We need to talk." She sat stiffly beside him.

Dominic's large hand enveloped hers—a lion claiming its mate. The warmth of his touch was almost painful.

Evelyn jerked her hand away instinctively.

After a charged silence, she blurted, "Victoria's dead. Did you kill her?"

Dominic's expression darkened instantly. "How interesting. You're more concerned about Victoria than the person who tried to murder me last night. Is her life worth more than mine?"

The reminder hit Evelyn like a physical blow. In her distress over Victoria, she'd nearly forgotten the assassination attempt.

"Who was it?" she demanded, eyes blazing. "Did you identify them?"

"Would you still mourn her if I told you it was Victoria?" Dominic's gaze pinned her in place.

Evelyn watched as shock morphed into dawning horror. "So... you did have her killed." Her throat constricted. "Was there no other way? Did it have to be so... final?"

The tenderness vanished from Dominic's face. "Don't look at me like that, Evelyn." His voice turned glacial. "I send all my enemies to hell. You know this about me."

###Chapter 126 

The air between them crackled with unspoken fury.

Though seated mere inches apart, Evelyn Thorne and Dominic Blackwood might as well have been on opposite sides of a battlefield.

Mrs. Wilkins hurried over with a tray of sliced fruits, her hands trembling slightly. "Madam, would you care for some refreshments? I've kept lunch warm for you."

Evelyn stood abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor. Without a word, she marched toward the dining area.

Dominic's piercing gaze followed her retreating figure. The woman was an enigma wrapped in fury.

If she truly despised him, she wouldn't bother eating under his roof.

Yet the fire in her emerald eyes betrayed the storm raging within.

Her empty stomach growled in protest, reminding Evelyn she'd skipped two meals. She ate slowly, knowing haste would only worsen the ache.

Nearly forty minutes later, she emerged to find the living room deserted.

"Strong emotions cloud judgment, Madam," Mrs. Wilkins murmured. "Perhaps some rest would help."

Evelyn massaged her throbbing temples and nodded. She turned toward the staircase.

The housekeeper hesitated. "I assumed you'd be using the master suite now. I've already prepared fresh linens there."

"I have no intention of sharing his bed," Evelyn stated coldly.

"But Mr. Blackwood's injuries—"

"He manages perfectly fine with that cane," Evelyn cut in.

"You don't mean that."

"I mean every word."

"Last night when you tended his wounds—"

"Enough." Evelyn pivoted sharply and ascended to the second floor.

The master bedroom lay in semi-darkness, curtains drawn against the afternoon sun. Dominic appeared asleep, his chiseled features relaxed.

Evelyn's breath caught. All her anger suddenly had nowhere to go.

She'd been raised to value restraint, to never succumb to the wild impulses that drove Dominic.

Perching gingerly on the mattress edge, she studied his face.

Without warning, a strong arm encircled her waist, pulling her down.

Dominic's stormy eyes met hers. He'd been awake the whole time.

From the moment she entered, his resolve had crumbled.

"She chose the window herself," he rasped.

Explanations didn't come easily to him. Pride had always been his armor.

Yet for Evelyn, he'd tear it off piece by piece.

"Even if she hadn't jumped, I wouldn't have spared her."

This was the unvarnished truth of Dominic Blackwood.

"Surviving last night means nothing. My enemies won't stop coming." His fingers traced her jawline. "Mercy would only get me killed. Do you truly believe any of them would change?"

Evelyn searched his face - the sharp angles, the shadows beneath his eyes. Her chest constricted.

He was right. No man was immortal. Not even Dominic Blackwood.

###Chapter 127

If Dominic had been killed last night, would justice truly be served?

Even if the murderer faced punishment, would it bring him back?

No.

Never.

"I'm not blaming you, Dominic… I just need time to process everything," Evelyn murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

"You don't have to accept it," he replied, his tone firm yet gentle. "But you should know—I would never harm an innocent person."

"Okay."

"Rest now," Dominic said, his fingers tracing soothing circles along her back until she finally drifted off.

Enveloped in his warmth, surrounded by the familiar scent of sandalwood and spice, Evelyn fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.

At five in the evening, her phone buzzed violently on the nightstand.

The police station.

They needed her—immediately.

Without waking Dominic, she slipped out of bed, dressed quickly, and left.

When she arrived, the first thing she saw was Margaret Thorne's bloodshot eyes—filled with hatred the moment they landed on her.

The officer led them into a private room.

"The DNA results confirm the victim was Victoria Thorne."

Margaret let out a choked sob.

"My daughter was murdered! She was bright, full of life—how could this happen?!"

"From our investigation, Victoria was responsible for the car crash on Hawthorne Avenue last night," the officer stated. "She also orchestrated the assassination attempt on Dominic Blackwood. Here's the evidence."

A stack of documents and a phone slid across the table.

Evelyn barely glanced at them.

"Lies!" Margaret shrieked, slamming her hands on the table. "She was just a college student! She would never do something like this!"

"She hired a hitman," the officer countered. "If Mr. Blackwood’s security hadn’t acted fast, he’d be dead. Given his contributions to Ravenswood, this was a serious crime. If she hadn’t taken her own life, she would’ve faced severe consequences."

"You're saying she killed herself?!"

Margaret looked like she was about to collapse.

"Yes. Surveillance footage shows her jumping from the hotel window—no one forced her."

The officer played the video.

Even in the dim lighting, the terror on Victoria’s face was unmistakable as she ran—then leaped.

The entire ordeal lasted less than ten minutes.

"This is bullshit!" Margaret screamed. "She was scared! Someone made her do it!"

"Our investigation found that the hotel staff opened the door. The hitman admitted Victoria hired him. When Mr. Blackwood’s men confronted her, she couldn’t handle the guilt and jumped."

"It was Dominic Blackwood!" Margaret snarled. "He killed my baby!"

The officer sighed. "Your daughter hired an assassin. That kind of behavior reflects poorly on her upbringing."

"Shut your mouth!" Margaret lunged forward, but the officer held her back. "You’re protecting a murderer! I won’t let this go!"

With that, she stormed out.

Evelyn stayed to sign the paperwork.

The case was closed.

Outside, Evelyn barely had time to hail a cab before Margaret grabbed her arm, nails digging into her skin.

"I know it was you and Dominic! You killed Victoria to punish me!" Her voice was raw with fury. "You heartless witch, Evelyn Thorne! Your father would be disgusted by what you’ve become!"

If she’d had a weapon, Evelyn had no doubt Margaret would have used it.

Then—

A sharp honk cut through the air.

A sleek black Rolls-Royce screeched to a halt inches from them.
###Chapter 128

Evelyn forcefully wrenched her arm free from Margaret's grasp.

She recognized the sleek black car immediately—Dominic's. Without hesitation, she marched toward it.

The driver's side door swung open, and the towering bodyguard stepped out, his glare locked onto Margaret as he advanced.

Evelyn's pulse spiked. She darted forward, blocking his path.

"Don't!" she commanded, pressing a hand against his chest. "Her daughter just died. She's grieving."

Margaret scoffed, her lips curling into a sneer. "Still clinging to the Blackwoods, I see. You always did have a talent for wrapping men around your finger."

The bodyguard's arm tensed, ready to strike.

Evelyn grabbed his wrist. "Get back in the car," she ordered firmly. "I'll handle this."

With one last warning glare at Margaret, the bodyguard retreated.

Margaret shivered under his icy stare but forced herself to stand tall.

Victoria was gone. But she was still here—and she would make sure Evelyn paid.

Once the car door shut, Evelyn turned on Margaret, her voice low and lethal. "Say whatever you want about me. But don’t you dare drag my father into this."

Her eyes burned with fury. "You funneled three hundred million dollars to your brother while my father was alive. Every cent—you will pay it back."

Margaret's face twisted. "That was James’s doing! What does that have to do with me? Do you think I wanted Thornfield Industries to collapse?"

Evelyn laughed coldly. "Yet you fled abroad with that stolen money. You wouldn’t even be here now if Victoria hadn’t died."

Margaret's face flushed crimson.

"Vincent told me everything!" she spat. "You stole your father’s Cerebra System! He invested hundreds of millions into that project. Who are you to judge me?"

Evelyn's smile was razor-sharp. "The difference is, my father gave me what was rightfully mine. You? You’re nothing but a thief. And I’ll make sure your brother rots in prison for what he took."

Margaret’s hands trembled, her retort dying in her throat.

All she could do was watch as Evelyn slid into the car and sped away.

The moment the door closed, Evelyn exhaled sharply, her shoulders sagging.

She glanced at Dominic. "What are you doing here?"

He handed her a chilled water bottle. "I knew Margaret was coming. I didn’t trust her not to start trouble."

Evelyn took a sip, arching a brow. "You think I can’t handle her?"

"You’re only tough with me," he murmured, amused.

She rolled her eyes. "I’m starving. No energy to argue."

"Want to eat out?" he asked. "What are you craving?"

Evelyn hesitated. "…I miss my mom’s cooking."

Dominic reached for his phone. "We can go to her place."

She glanced at his legs, frowning. "Her building doesn’t have wheelchair access. It’s not practical."

"We can grab the cane from home first."

Evelyn sighed. "If we’re going home, we might as well just eat there."

Dominic studied her for a moment, then dialed a number.

Evelyn blinked as Clara’s voice came through the speaker. "Dominic? Is everything alright?"

###Chapter 129

"Yes, Mom. It's me," Dominic answered.

Evelyn choked on her water, coughing violently.

He actually called her mother Mom!

"Here's the situation. Evelyn mentioned she's craving your cooking, but it's not convenient for me to bring her to your place. I was thinking of reserving a private dining room nearby. Would you be able to come and prepare a meal there?" Dominic's voice was smooth, almost tender.

"Of course! Just send me the address, and I'll be there," Clara replied without hesitation.

"Thank you," Dominic said before ending the call and forwarding the location.

Evelyn stared at him, utterly stunned.

"Are you out of your mind? I was just making an offhand comment! And you actually summoned my mother to cook for me?" Her voice rose in disbelief. "Since when do you take anything I say seriously? What's gotten into you?"

"From now on, I will," Dominic said, his gaze intense, voice firm.

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks, her pulse hammering so loudly she was sure he could hear it.

"Don't!" she protested. "What if, next time we argue, I say I want you dead? Are you just going to hand me a knife?"

"Must you always assume we'll be fighting?"

"Because we always disagree! That's normal, isn't it? Show me two people who see eye-to-eye on everything."

"Maybe they exist. We just haven't met them."

Evelyn scoffed. "I wouldn’t want someone who agrees with everything I say. Where’s the fun in that?" Her fingers fidgeted, her ears turning pink. "A little friction keeps things interesting."

Dominic studied her, his dark eyes unreadable.

"If you prefer someone more agreeable, go find them. I won’t stop you," she added, suddenly defensive under his scrutiny.

"There are more important things in my life than relationships," she muttered.

"I didn’t say anything. Stop putting words in my mouth," Dominic snapped, frustration lacing his tone.

Evelyn took another sip of water, avoiding his gaze.

"You went too far, dragging my mother into this. She’s not your personal chef. If I were her, I’d be furious."

"You’ve never been a mother, Evelyn. You don’t understand how she feels."

What he meant was simple—Clara wouldn’t mind.

What mother wouldn’t want to cook for her own child? It wasn’t as if he was demanding it every day.

But his words struck deeper than he realized.

"You think I don’t want to be a mother?" Evelyn’s voice cracked. "You’re the one who took that choice from me!"

Dominic froze when he saw the tears glistening in her eyes.

His lips parted, but no words came.

After a heavy silence, Evelyn whispered, "Is your depression why you refuse to have children?"

"Depression doesn’t automatically mean the child will suffer. Doctors monitor for risks. You don’t get to decide whether a life is worth living."

Dominic turned toward the window, jaw clenched.

He was holding back—something dark, something raw.

When he finally spoke, his voice was ice. "Never bring up children again. Ask for anything else, and it’s yours."

"And if all I want is a child?"

Evelyn reached for his hand, her throat tight. "What if I begged you?"

Before she could finish, Dominic pulled away.

His answer was clear.

###Chapter 130

The aroma of home-cooked meals filled the air as Clara arranged the dishes on the table. "Evelyn, come with me for a moment," she called out softly.

Evelyn followed her mother toward the restroom, her steps measured.

"Did something happen between you and Dominic?" Clara asked, her voice laced with concern.

Evelyn exhaled, her expression unreadable. "Is it that obvious?"

Perhaps years of disappointment had dulled the sting, leaving her numb.

"It is. You two look like a couple on the brink of separation," Clara murmured. "The way you glare at each other—it's exactly how your father and I looked before signing the divorce papers."

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn’s lips.

"We didn’t discuss divorce. It’s just… about children. We can’t seem to agree."

Clara’s brows furrowed. "He still refuses? Did he give a reason?"

Evelyn shook her head. "He’s battling depression. Every time I think about it, I remind myself not to push."

"That poor man," Clara sighed. "What’s the point of all that wealth if he’s suffering? In some ways, we’re richer—health is priceless."

Evelyn smirked. "You have no idea just how wealthy he is." She squeezed her mother’s hand. "Thanks for cooking, Mom."

Clara waved her off. "I’d cook for you every day if I could, though I’m sure the chefs at Mooncrest Manor put my meals to shame."

"Nothing compares to your cooking," Evelyn said warmly. "Let’s eat before it gets cold."

"I already ate before coming. Besides, the tension between you two killed my appetite," Clara teased. "I’ll head home now. Try not to provoke him—we can’t afford to make an enemy of the Blackwoods."

Evelyn grinned. "Don’t worry. I’ll handle him."

After seeing Clara off, Evelyn returned to the table.

A plate of meticulously peeled shrimp awaited her.

Dominic had prepared them.

"You’re quite the charmer, aren’t you?" Evelyn remarked, popping one into her mouth.

"I’m usually the one being pursued," Dominic replied matter-of-factly.

Evelyn nearly choked.

"Consider me honored to eat shrimp peeled by your hands."

"It’d be nice if you were always this agreeable, Evelyn."

She inhaled deeply, pushing down her frustration.

"I’ll try not to pick fights," she said softly. Then, after a pause, "I’m performing at the university’s Christmas concert next week. Will you be busy with work?"

"I am, but I won’t attend."

"Right. You should rest your legs."

Evelyn picked up a shrimp, dipped it in sauce, and held it out to him.

Dominic hesitated before accepting it, his lips brushing her fingers.

A strange warmth bloomed in his chest as he chewed.

The earlier tension dissolved into quiet harmony.

"Are you performing?" he asked.

"Of course. It’s my last Christmas concert before graduation."

Dominic’s gaze flickered. "I’d like to go."

Evelyn blinked. "How? Family isn’t even allowed."

"I have my ways."

She studied his impassive face and felt an unexpected relief.

"Right. With your influence, a donation would get you in. They’d probably let you tour the girls’ dormitory too."

Dominic’s eyes narrowed.

She had just promised not to provoke him.

Christmas arrived swiftly.

Evelyn left for campus at dawn, and Dominic rose only after she was gone.
###Chapter 131

Dominic’s recovery was progressing better than expected. With the help of his walking stick, he could move around with surprising ease.

He rose from bed and made his way to his walk-in closet, scanning the rows of tailored suits and dress shirts.

Nearly everything was in deep, muted tones—charcoal, navy, black.

His lips pressed into a thin line as he took in the monochromatic gloom.

After a moment of hesitation, he abandoned the task and reached for his phone, dialing Nathan.

"Nathan, I need a light-colored suit."

"Certainly, sir. Casual or formal?"

"Casual."

"Understood. I'll arrange it immediately," Nathan replied smoothly. "Also, the jeweler you commissioned has finalized the design sketches. I've sent them to your email. They can begin production as soon as you approve."

"Good."

Dominic ended the call and strode into his study, powering up his laptop.

New Year’s Eve was approaching—the first one he would spend with Evelyn. He wanted it to be unforgettable.

He clicked open Nathan’s email and examined the intricate sketch of the custom diamond ring.

The design was inspired by a snowflake—delicate, unique, and breathtaking. Just like Evelyn.

At Ravenswood University, Evelyn and Sophie sat in the bustling cafeteria after morning rehearsals.

"Why did you drop out of the dance performance?" Sophie asked, stirring her iced tea.

"Too much work. I’d rather focus on my song," Evelyn answered absently, glancing at her phone. "Is Adrian coming to the concert?"

"He wanted to, but he’s not a student. No way they’d let him in."

Evelyn nodded.

"Is your husband coming? Rumor has it you two have been inseparable lately. True? You’ve been ignoring my texts about it," Sophie accused, narrowing her eyes.

"Did Adrian tell you that?" Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Since when did he become such a gossip? You should remind him to focus on his career instead."

Sophie smirked. "All I care about right now is romance! Speaking of which—have you told Dominic about grad school abroad? I made Adrian swear not to mention it, so I doubt he knows."

Evelyn’s expression flickered.

Sophie didn’t miss it.

"You haven’t told him? Worried he’ll stop you?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of water. "I’ll tell him after the holidays."

"Fine! So—is he coming to the concert or not? If he is, tell him to bring Adrian along!"

"He’s coming."

Sophie sighed dramatically. "And yet you still refuse to admit things are going well! He’s skipping his company’s gala for our concert. That means you’re more important than work! Meanwhile, Adrian wouldn’t miss that gala for anything. So no, your husband won’t have to babysit my Adrian."

Evelyn shuddered.

"Please stop saying ‘your husband’ and ‘my Adrian.’ Since when did you get so cringey?"

Sophie grinned. "Am I wrong? Dominic Blackwood is your husband. Adrian might not be mine yet, but pet names are normal, aren’t they?"

Evelyn flagged down a waiter and ordered, handing the menu back without another word.

"Do you think he’ll go onstage and give you flowers after your performance?" Sophie asked, eyes sparkling with anticipation.

Evelyn scoffed. "How? With his cane?"

Sophie deflated. "What a waste! I was hoping to see you two go public in front of the whole school!"

"Stop watching so many rom-coms," Evelyn deadpanned.

Sophie groaned. "What kind of relationship is this? You’re so boring! Where’s the passion?"

###Chapter 132 Evelyn remained impassive.

It was undeniable that her relationship with Dominic lacked the excitement others seemed to have.

Just last weekend, they'd spent every moment inside his penthouse.

Dominic alternated between working in his private study and reading in the sunlit lounge.

Evelyn divided her time between drafting her research paper and reading alongside him in companionable silence.

The book in Dominic's hands was written in some obscure European language Evelyn couldn't decipher.

She was engrossed in Professor Sebastian Whitmore's groundbreaking neurology publication.

Certain Dominic wouldn't comprehend a single term either, she felt no intellectual disadvantage.

"Don't you love my new bracelet?" Sophie suddenly removed the delicate chain from her wrist, thrusting it toward Evelyn.

"It's lovely. A gift from your beau?"

"Exactly! My Christmas present." Sophie's eyes sparkled. "Look - it's even got my initials engraved!"

"You can find jewelry stores offering free engraving for under twenty dollars," Evelyn said matter-of-factly. "Don't let commercial gimmicks cloud your judgment."

Sophie merely laughed.

"Darling, it's not about the engraving. I'm touched he remembered! The day he stops making my heart flutter is the day I walk away."

Evelyn had no rebuttal.

"You're being unusually cynical. Has Dominic never given you anything?" Sophie probed. "He might be older and more reserved, but you're young! Must you act like a jaded widow? If he won't initiate romance, you should!"

Evelyn ignored her and focused on her salad.

The evening concert commenced promptly at seven.

Backstage in the dressing room, Evelyn and Sophie made final preparations.

"Evelyn! Is your husb—"

"Mind your surroundings!" Evelyn hissed, glancing meaningfully at nearby performers.

Sophie lowered her voice. "Has Dominic arrived? Any calls? I peeked at the audience - it's packed. Where's he sitting?"

Evelyn checked her phone. No new notifications.

An unexpected pang struck her.

Had he changed his mind?

Perhaps he wouldn't come after all.

"No contact. I've no idea if he's here or where he might be seated." Evelyn straightened her dress. "Even if he attends, he'll likely maintain his anonymity. We might pretend not to know each other if our paths cross."

Sophie's jaw dropped, Evelyn's pragmatic words dousing her enthusiasm for romantic drama.

Dominic arrived on campus at eight sharp.

Evelyn's performance was thirteenth in the lineup, approximately an hour after commencement.

His timing was impeccable.

Entering the auditorium flanked by discreet security, Dominic commanded immediate attention.

Dressed in a powder-blue button-down beneath a tailored white blazer with matching slacks, he moved with deliberate grace.

No wheelchair. No cane.

Though not fully recovered, his measured steps exuded quiet strength.

He looked every inch the aristocratic lead from a period romance.

Whispers rippled through the crowd as Dominic took his front-row seat.

Backstage, Sophie spotted him instantly.

"Oh. My. God!" She gasped, rushing to Evelyn. "That ivory ensemble! He's devastating! He came! Definitely for you! Front and center! I might faint!"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Edging toward the stage curtains, she stole a glance.

There Dominic sat, his luminous presence piercing her composure like sunlight through stained glass.

"Evelyn! You're on! Knock 'em dead! Show that husband of yours what he's been missing!" Sophie gave an encouraging shoulder squeeze.

Evelyn blinked back unexpected moisture.

"Must you be so theatrical, Sophie Mercer?"

"Next, the Ravenswood Conservatory's brightest star, Miss Evelyn Thorne, performing 'Tim McGraw' on acoustic guitar. Let's welcome her with applause!" Following the announcer's introduction, Evelyn stepped into the spotlight.
###Chapter 133

Evelyn's chestnut hair was tied in a loose braid, cascading over one shoulder as she adjusted the strap of her guitar. She wore a fitted leather jacket over a flowing ivory chiffon dress that swayed with her movements.

Taking her position on the elevated stool center stage, she tested the microphone with a soft hum. The auditorium plunged into darkness, leaving only the golden spotlight tracing her silhouette.

Her fingers danced across the guitar strings, weaving a haunting melody that filled the concert hall. Evelyn's crystalline voice rose effortlessly, though her eyes remained half-lidded, lost in the music.

Yet she could sense him. That familiar, intense gaze burning through her performance from somewhere in the sea of faces.

A sudden gasp rippled through the audience as thousands of crimson rose petals began raining from the ceiling. The stage lights flared to life, casting the falling petals in a dreamlike glow.

Evelyn's dark lashes fluttered open in surprise. No one had mentioned this elaborate production during rehearsal!

Her cheeks flushed pink beneath the spotlight as she continued singing, though her pulse raced at the unexpected romantic gesture.

Then came the whisper of mechanical wings. A sleek black drone emerged from the shadows, carrying a lavish bouquet of midnight-blue orchids - her favorite.

The crowd erupted in delighted screams and applause.

Evelyn's heart hammered against her ribs as she carefully retrieved the flowers. Their intoxicating scent wrapped around her like an embrace.

"Happy holidays, everyone!" she called out, her voice trembling slightly. Her eyes instinctively sought the front row, where a familiar broad-shouldered figure had been seated moments ago.

Backstage, Sophie clutched her chest dramatically. "I take back everything I said about Dominic being predictable!" she sniffed, wiping imaginary tears. "That man just redefined romance!"

As Evelyn exited the stage, the swarm of curious classmates descended.

"Who sent the flowers? That drone delivery was insane!"
"Tell us about your mystery man, Evelyn! We saw you looking at someone special in the audience!"

Sophie materialized like a guardian angel, steering Evelyn through the throng. "Back off, vultures! Can't you see she's—"

Their escape was blocked by a lanky senior nervously shifting his weight. "E-Evelyn? I've admired you since freshman orientation. Since we're graduating soon, I thought—"

"Sorry, champ," Sophie cut in, patting his shoulder. "The flower rain? The drone? That wasn't Santa's handiwork. She's very much taken."

As if summoned, the sound of polished dress shoes echoed down the hallway. Dominic emerged from the shadows, his tailored overcoat dusted with stray petals, his piercing gaze locked on Evelyn.

The student blinked. "Oh! Are you... her father?"

Dominic's jaw tightened imperceptibly as he came to stand beside Evelyn, his hand finding the small of her back in a possessive gesture that answered all unspoken questions.

Under the flickering hallway lights, the contrast between them was striking - the youthful musician still buzzing with performance adrenaline, and the powerful businessman whose very presence commanded the space around them.

Evelyn bit back a smile as she inhaled the lingering scent of orchids mingled with Dominic's distinctive cologne - sandalwood and something dangerously intoxicating.

This was no dream. The petals in her hair and the warmth of his hand against her back proved it.

###Chapter 134 Evelyn felt Dominic's body tense beside her.

The tailored suit made him look younger, yet people still treated him with the deference reserved for someone older.

It clearly irritated him.

"I'm Evelyn's—"

Dominic started to speak, but Evelyn cut him off by grasping his hand firmly. "I don't know this guy," she said quickly. "It's freezing out here. Let's get to the car!"

Sophie smoothly maneuvered the persistent student out of their path.

Evelyn shot her friend a grateful glance before guiding Dominic back to the waiting Rolls-Royce.

"You shouldn't be walking so much when your legs haven't fully healed," she chided gently, her voice laced with concern.

"The pain's gone," Dominic insisted.

His gaze dropped to the floral arrangement in Evelyn's arms.

"There's something hidden in the bouquet," he mentioned casually.

"What?" Evelyn's eyes widened as she stared at him. "You got me a present? But I didn't get you anything."

An awkward silence settled between them.

They'd spent the entire week confined to the house.

When had he possibly arranged this?

Dominic opened the car door, ushering Evelyn inside first.

"I didn't expect anything in return."

The rich timbre of his voice sent an unexpected flutter through Evelyn's chest.

Inside the vehicle, she carefully parted the blooms to discover a petite rose-gold jewelry box.

The diamond ring inside took her breath away.

Though elegantly simple in design, the center stone was... substantial.

When Dominic settled beside her, she couldn't resist teasing him.

"I never pegged you as the flashy type. Since when do you have such... bold taste?"

"You don't like it?" Dominic's intense gaze locked onto hers. "What style would you prefer?"

He'd assumed all women adored diamonds—the more impressive, the better.

Evelyn lifted the ring, letting it catch the light. "Don't you think it's slightly... excessive? A stone this size might make my hand look disproportionate."

Dominic studied her delicate fingers and vehemently disagreed.

Everything looked exquisite on her.

"I couldn't bring myself to give you anything less," he said simply.

"Fine, forget I mentioned it," Evelyn conceded, carefully replacing the ring. "Thank you for coming to the recital."

"You have an exceptional voice," Dominic murmured.

Her angelic tones still echoed in his mind.

"Why did you choose art history?" he asked suddenly.

Evelyn's grip tightened around the flowers. "You want to know why I picked that major?"

Dominic shook his head.

"My stepmother chose it for me. She convinced my father it was an easy degree." Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Not exactly the most practical field unless you come from money."

"Your father left you Thornfield Industries. He ensured your future," Dominic pointed out.

"He never mentioned it before he died." Bitterness crept into her voice. "After cheating on my mother, he barely acknowledged me. I hated him."

"Perhaps he felt he'd failed your mother and didn't want to repeat that mistake."

"How would you know? Is that how all men think?"

"We're discussing your father."

"Yet you sound like you understand him perfectly."

Evelyn caught herself before the conversation escalated further.

"Did you coordinate your outfit with mine tonight?" she asked instead.

Her navy jacket over white blouse mirrored Dominic's white shirt beneath a sapphire waistcoat—close enough to appear intentional.

The question visibly flustered him.

Why did she have to call attention to it?

"Yes," Dominic admitted bluntly, leaving Evelyn momentarily speechless.

Upon returning home, Evelyn showered first.

As Dominic took his turn, she lounged in bed scrolling through her phone when his device suddenly illuminated.

She glanced over to see a message notification from Lucas.

###Chapter 135

Evelyn couldn't resist the temptation. Her fingers hovered over the text message from Lucas before tapping it open.

(Your wife’s got a great voice! It’s a shame she’s not a singer!)

She hadn’t expected to stumble upon Dominic’s phone.

If he had set a passcode, she wouldn’t have been able to access it, but luck—or carelessness—was on her side.

After Lucas’s message, a video of Evelyn’s performance followed.

Sophie had already sent her the same clip earlier, gushing about how it was blowing up on the university’s online forum.

Evelyn quickly exited the message and placed the phone back where she’d found it.

But then—her finger slipped.

The screen flickered, and suddenly, Dominic’s photo gallery was open, images flashing before her eyes.

When Dominic stepped out of the bathroom, towel slung low on his hips, Evelyn gestured for him to sit beside her on the bed.

"I suddenly feel like cooking," she announced, tilting her head. "Should I make meals for you from now on?"

Dominic blinked, his damp hair tousled. "Are you serious?"

"I am!" Her voice was bright with enthusiasm. "No promises on quality, though. I’ve never really cooked before."

"You could try tomorrow," he suggested, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

"Deal!" She grinned, then let her gaze drift over his gray bathrobe. "You look good in light colors. You should wear them more often."

"I still got called your uncle, though."

Evelyn laughed, reaching up to cradle his face in her hands. "Maybe he was just teasing you. You looked incredibly handsome tonight."

Dominic’s large hand covered hers, his dark eyes narrowing slightly. "Why the sudden affection?"

Heat rushed to her cheeks under his intense gaze.

She buried her face against his neck, murmuring, "No reason. I just wanted to hold you."

A warmth spread through Dominic’s chest at her words. Without hesitation, he wrapped his arms around her, pulling her close.

Time slipped away after Christmas.

Dominic spent his days either buried in work in his study or leaning against the kitchen counter, watching Evelyn attempt to master cooking.

Evelyn, meanwhile, poured all her energy into perfecting her culinary skills.

On New Year’s Eve, Eleanor called first thing in the morning, reminding them to visit the family estate.

They took their time with breakfast before heading out, hands entwined.

"Should we have lunch with your mother first?" Dominic asked as they walked.

Evelyn had refused his suggestion to bring Clara along.

Even if she had agreed, Clara wouldn’t have come.

Evelyn smiled softly. "It’s fine. I just want today to be about us. It’s our first New Year’s Eve together, after all."

"There will be many more," he promised.

Her eyes flickered to the window. "Look at the snow! It’s perfect for building a snowman. Let’s do it!"

Dominic almost teased her for the childish idea, but he held back.

He wouldn’t ruin her excitement.

After lunch, Evelyn dragged him outside, their laughter ringing through the crisp winter air as they shaped snow into a lopsided figure.

The rest of the Blackwood family watched from a distance, murmuring among themselves.

It had been years since they’d seen Dominic laugh so freely—carefree, almost boyish.

"Are you happy, Dominic?" Evelyn asked suddenly, staring at their finished snowman.

"I am."

I’m happy as long as I’m with you, he thought, but kept the words to himself.
###Chapter 136

The afternoon sun cast golden rays through the curtains as Evelyn and Dominic returned home to rest, knowing they’d be staying up late to welcome the new year.

Once Dominic had drifted off, Evelyn opened her eyes, her gaze lingering on his face.

She could never tire of looking at him.

If only time would freeze.

This moment—perfect, serene—was everything she wanted to last forever.

When Dominic stirred awake around four, the space beside him was empty.

He rose and descended the stairs, finding Evelyn in the kitchen, already preparing dinner.

"You're awake!" she greeted, flashing him a warm smile.

"I was thinking of making steak tonight. What do you think?"

Dominic leaned against the doorway, watching her move with effortless grace.

"Let me cook instead," he offered.

Evelyn’s brows shot up in surprise. "You cook?" She untied her apron with a playful smirk. "By all means! I’ve never tasted your culinary skills before."

"I’ve never tried, but I can follow instructions," Dominic admitted, taking the apron from her. "Go relax in the living room."

"Can I stay and watch?" she asked, eyes gleaming with curiosity.

Dominic pulled out a chair for her without protest.

Evelyn sat, thoroughly entertained as he worked with surprising precision.

Everything he did carried an air of effortless mastery.

When she took her first bite of the steak that evening, she couldn’t help but gush.

"This is better than any five-star restaurant."

"Maybe you haven’t dined at the right places," he teased.

"Can’t you just accept the compliment?"

"Fine. I’ll admit—I’m a natural."

Evelyn laughed, shaking her head.

She picked the broccoli from her plate and dropped it onto his, then stole a cherry tomato from his in return, popping it into her mouth.

"Don’t be picky, Evelyn," Dominic chided, though his tone was light as he ate the rejected greens.

"I’m not! I just prefer my vegetables roasted, not steamed."

After dinner, they took a leisurely walk outside before settling in the living room with the TV humming softly.

Evelyn rested her head against Dominic’s shoulder, her eyelids growing heavy.

He nudged her awake at half past eleven.

"Time for fireworks. The new year’s almost here."

A bright smile curved her lips, though something wistful flickered in her eyes.

They bundled up and stepped outside, where their bodyguard was setting up the display.

Soon, the night sky erupted in a dazzling array of colors.

Evelyn tilted her head back, the cool breeze brushing against her skin.

"I have something for you," Dominic murmured near her ear.

She turned, surprised. "A gift? We agreed not to exchange anything."

Once again, she had nothing for him.

"I ordered this in advance," he said, pulling a small velvet box from his pocket.

Evelyn didn’t need to open it to guess what was inside.

"We’ve been married over half a year. Consider this your belated wedding ring."

He lifted the lid, revealing a stunning diamond ring nestled within.

Tears welled in Evelyn’s eyes.

Dominic slid the ring onto her finger with deliberate care.

"It’s perfect," she whispered, her voice thick with emotion.

"I’m glad you like it," he replied, his fingers tightening around hers.

Above them, the fireworks painted the sky in brilliant hues.

As the countdown began, Evelyn rose onto her toes and pressed her lips to his.

Dominic felt the dampness on her cheeks before he saw her tears.

He wanted to ask why she was crying, but the clock struck midnight.

"Happy New Year, Dominic Blackwood," she whispered, her grip on him loosening.
###Chapter 137

"Happy New Year, Evelyn," Dominic murmured, his fingers brushing away the tears staining her porcelain cheeks.

Evelyn recoiled as if burned, putting deliberate distance between them.

"I'm done with this, Dominic," she stated, her voice brittle as winter frost.

Before he could respond, she twisted the diamond engagement ring from her finger with trembling hands.

"I can't keep this." The words tasted like ash as she thrust the glittering stone into his coat pocket.

Her breath hitched. "I love you... but I can't keep loving you like this."

Moonlight caught in the tear tracks on her face as she lifted her chin defiantly.

"Those photos of her - on your computer, your phone..." Evelyn's voice cracked. "She's in your heart too, isn't she? You treat me well, Dominic, but she owns you. I won't beg for explanations or demand you choose. Because we both know how that would end."

She swallowed hard. "It's over."

This wasn't a negotiation.

This was her final decree.

Dominic stood paralyzed, shock carving lines into his handsome face.

Everything had been perfect mere hours ago.

Her homemade meals waiting when he returned late from work. The way she curled against him each night...

He'd believed they had forever.

When had she made this decision?

The realization struck like a physical blow - she'd been withdrawing for weeks.

Maybe since the holidays. Maybe longer.

"My lawyer will contact yours after New Year's," Evelyn said, swiping angrily at fresh tears. "I'm leaving Ravenshore tonight."

She took another step backward, her voice breaking. "Don't follow me, Dominic. Don't call. Let's pretend... let's pretend none of this ever happened."

Her nails bit into her palms as she fought to steady her breathing.

That first glimpse of the mysterious woman's photos on Dominic's laptop had planted the seed of doubt.

Finding them again on his phone - carefully preserved among zero other images - had been the final betrayal.

The truth was undeniable now.

However much Dominic cared for her, his heart belonged to another.

A yellow cab materialized at Evelyn's raised hand.

Against her better judgment, she glanced back one final time.

Only empty pavement greeted her, the winter wind howling through the abandoned street.

Dominic hadn't chased her.

Just as she'd known he wouldn.

However many nights she'd lain awake waiting for him to explain, to choose her - he never would.

The dam broke. Sobs wracked her body as she collapsed into the taxi's vinyl seat.

"Airport," she choked out to the driver.

Clara would be waiting there with their packed suitcases. Their flight departed in two hours.

Buildings blurred past the window as the cab accelerated, each familiar landmark twisting the knife deeper.

Every memory with Dominic played behind her eyelids - so vivid they hurt.

Her stomach contracted sharply as the twins kicked in protest.

Seven months along now. Their father would never hold them.

Four Years Later

3:17 AM

A sudden glow pierced the darkness of the Blackwood mansion's master suite.

Dominic jerked awake, fumbling for his buzzing phone.

Professor Whitmore's name flashed on the screen. He answered instantly.

"Dominic..." The voice was thready, strained. "I... don't have much time. That project we discussed... I'm entrusting it to... my student..."

A muffled thud.

Then silence.

Dominic was already on his feet, dread pooling in his gut.

"Sebastian?" No response. "Professor Whitmore!"

The line stayed dead.

Nearly an hour passed before his phone rang again - the professor's assistant this time.

"Mr. Blackwood," came the somber voice. "I'm sorry to inform you Professor Whitmore has passed. His chronic condition... When I saw you were his last call..."
###Chapter 138

The afternoon sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Mooncrest Manor's sales office. Evelyn Thorne studied the miniature property models with careful precision, her fingers tracing the contours of each tiny house.

A well-dressed sales associate approached, eyeing her youthful appearance with mild skepticism. "What type of residence are you considering, Miss? We have single-family homes, luxury townhouses, and duplexes available."

"Do you still have any single-family homes?" Evelyn asked without looking up.

The associate's demeanor instantly brightened. "We have one remaining estate home - over three thousand square feet with premium finishes. Naturally, the price reflects its exclusivity..."

"Can we take immediate occupancy with full payment today?"

"Absolutely!" The associate beamed. "All our properties come turnkey ready with designer furnishings. You'd only need to bring your personal effects."

Evelyn finally met the woman's gaze. "The price?"

"Four point five million. It's our last estate lot in this community, so-"

Evelyn's attention drifted across the room where Clara cradled a sleeping Lily. Little Henry stood protectively beside them, his obsidian eyes scanning the space with quiet intensity.

"Show me the property," Evelyn decided.

As Evelyn followed the saleswoman, Henry remained vigilant. Dressed in a crisp white tee and dark jeans, the boy's delicate features belied his serious nature. A sales associate offered him chocolates with a practiced smile.

"How old are you, sweetheart?"
"What's your name?"
"Is that your baby sister with grandma?"

Henry turned away silently. Clara offered an apologetic smile. "He's rather reserved with strangers."

The associate nodded understandingly, admiring Lily's peaceful face. "You have a beautiful family."

When Evelyn returned, her expression was decisive. "It's suitable. Shall we proceed?"

Clara frowned. "It's quite extravagant. Your father's first home cost less than half a million."

Evelyn chuckled. "That was decades ago, Mother." She produced a black credit card with effortless grace.

Within the hour, paperwork was complete. As the Thorne family departed, whispers followed them.

"Did you see? Full cash payment!"
"So young with two children... must be married to money."
"With that face? I'm not surprised."

At their new estate, Clara settled Lily in the master suite while Henry stood guard. "Henry darling," Clara said softly, "I'm going to market for supper. Watch your sister for me?"

The boy gave a solemn nod, his small frame radiating quiet responsibility as Clara departed.
###Chapter 139

"Evelyn, I'm going to pick up some groceries. You should rest if you're tired," Clara said, adjusting her scarf by the doorway.

Evelyn methodically unpacked their suitcases, carefully placing each item in its designated spot.

"Drive safely, Mom. I'm fine though - I'll finish organizing our things."

"Alright, I won't be long."

The moment the front door clicked shut, the house was enveloped in peaceful stillness.

Evelyn worked efficiently, quickly sorting through their belongings before moving to check on the children.

Lily lay curled up in deep slumber, her chest rising and falling rhythmically. Beside her, Henry's eyes were closed but his fingers twitched slightly - a sign he wasn't fully asleep.

As Evelyn quietly retreated from the room, an uncharacteristic shadow crossed her normally composed features.

Henry was physically healthy, yet fundamentally different from other children his age.

The boy maintained an impenetrable silence around anyone outside their small family circle.

At four years old, he'd never set foot in a classroom.

Evelyn had lost count of the medical specialists they'd consulted.

Every test result came back normal - remarkably so. Scans showed his cerebral cortex development far exceeded average levels.

The challenge wasn't physical, but psychological.

Even the most renowned child psychiatrists couldn't unravel the mystery of Henry's selective mutism.

At least Lily presented no such complications.

While reserved with strangers, she could express herself when needed.

The sudden vibration of her phone startled Evelyn from her thoughts.

"Have you settled in okay, Evelyn?" Wesley Ashford's familiar voice came through the receiver.

"We're all moved in. The kids are napping and Mom's out shopping," Evelyn replied, keeping her voice low. "When's your flight back? We should catch up when you return."

"I'll contact you as soon as I land," Wesley said before his tone shifted. "There's something you should know. Five years ago, Dominic Blackwood commissioned Professor Whitmore for a highly confidential project. Even I wasn't privy to the details. Three days ago, Dominic began investigating all of the professor's former students."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. "What exactly is he searching for?"

"When authorities reviewed the professor's final communications, they found a recorded call with Dominic. Professor Whitmore mentioned transferring the case to one of his students, but passed before specifying who." Wesley hesitated. "Evelyn... I believe that student was you."

A cold wave washed over Evelyn.

"There's no way I could solve something the professor couldn't crack in five years."

"Nobody is more qualified. The professor once told me your abilities had surpassed his own..." Wesley paused meaningfully. "Knowing you're avoiding Dominic, I excluded your name from the student list provided. I only submitted graduates who pursued medical degrees. No one knows you continued working with the professor post-graduation. You're safe."

"Thank you, Wesley." Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Dinner's on me when you're back!"

Her children's safety was non-negotiable.

Any connection to Dominic Blackwood was a risk she couldn't take.

"Just be careful. You're in his territory now."

Later that evening at 9 p.m., Henry and Lily sat cross-legged on their shared bed, their matching pajamas bathed in the soft glow of the bedside lamp.

"Did you find out about our dad, Henry?" Lily whispered eagerly.

Henry's expression remained impassive as he answered, "Julian Whitmore."

"Really? That's his name?" Lily grabbed her brother's arm, eyes shining with excitement. "How did you know? What's he look like?"

Henry's brow furrowed in a frown that eerily mirrored Dominic's signature expression.

Without a word, he slid off the bed with Lily close behind.

Henry opened his laptop to reveal a hospital record photo.

"That's Julian Whitmore. Our father."

Earlier that afternoon, he'd hacked into Ravenswood Medical Center's database, uncovering Evelyn's maternity records from four years ago. The documents clearly listed Julian Whitmore as the father of her children.

###Chapter 140

Lily's breath caught in her throat as she stared at Julian's photo glowing on the laptop screen.

"He's gorgeous!" she squealed, bouncing on the bed.

Henry slammed the laptop shut with a scowl. "Looks don't matter when you're a coward who abandoned us."

The twins had never heard a single harsh word about their father from Evelyn. Whenever Lily asked about him, their mother would simply say, "You don't have a father."

Henry flopped onto his pillow, glaring at the ceiling. "He won't care about us," he muttered darkly.

Lily's lower lip trembled. "But why? We don't want anything from him! I just want to meet him once!"

"Go to sleep."

"I can't!" She kicked the blankets in frustration. "I want Daddy!"

Henry's jaw tightened. The mere thought of their so-called father made his blood boil. "Enough!" he snapped.

Lily immediately stilled. Sensing her brother's anger, she wrapped her tiny arms around him. "I'm sorry, Henry. I won't talk about him anymore if it upsets you."

Henry sighed, gently pushing her away. "I'll figure something out," he conceded.

Lily's entire face lit up as she hugged him again. "You're the best brother ever! I'll listen to whatever you say!"

Meanwhile, Evelyn stood motionless before the floor-to-ceiling windows in her penthouse, watching the city lights twinkle below.

Four years.

It felt like both an eternity and the blink of an eye.

Though she'd severed all contact with Dominic, their legal bond remained unbroken. The divorce papers still bore only one signature.

Evelyn dialed her lawyer with steady fingers. "Try again tomorrow, Mr. Thornton. If he refuses, inform him I'm taking this to court."

Her voice didn't waver, though the memory of her tear-stained face at the airport four years ago flashed through her mind.

How naive she'd been.

While she'd been drowning in grief, Dominic had been photographed at galas and charity events, living his best life without her. That realization had hardened her resolve to move on.

"You're back in Eldermere, Miss Thorne?" Mr. Thornton asked.

"Yes."

"Perhaps you should meet him in person? He stopped taking my calls ages ago—probably blocked my number."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone.

"Of course, I can contact him from another line if you prefer," the lawyer continued. "But face-to-face discussions tend to yield better results."

"Use a new number," Evelyn said firmly.

"Very well."

After hanging up, she scrolled through her contacts. Rebuilding Thornfield Industries wasn't her only reason for returning.

She would restore her father's empire to its former glory—no, she'd make it greater than ever. Every stolen cent would be reclaimed, with interest.

Her finger hovered over the name of Thornfield's former HR manager before pressing call.

###Chapter 141

The phone rang several times before the call was finally picked up.

"Hello, Uncle Frederick. It's Evelyn Thorne. Do you remember me?"

"Evelyn Thorne? How could I forget you? Thornfield Industries wouldn't have collapsed if it weren't for you!" His voice was sharp with resentment. "What, did you lose all your money overseas and come crawling back for a handout? Let me make this clear—you won't get a single cent from me!"

Evelyn remained unfazed by the venom in his tone.

"That's not why I'm calling," she said calmly. "I was just wondering if you'd ever considered switching companies."

"Switching companies?" Frederick scoffed. "Are you a headhunter now?"

"I'm planning to rebuild Thornfield Industries. If possible, I'd like to bring back the original team. If you're willing to return, I can double your current salary."

Frederick Dawson nearly choked on his own breath.

"Are you serious?" he sputtered.

Evelyn's voice was steady. "Completely."

Frederick exhaled sharply. "Did you win the lottery or something? Do you have any idea how much doubling everyone's salary would cost?"

"I can afford it," she replied simply.

A beat of silence. Then—

"If you're really serious, then hell yes, I'll come back! I've got no problem with money!" He paused, then muttered under his breath, "You really hit the jackpot, didn't you?"

"Not exactly," Evelyn said, amused. "But rebuilding Thornfield Industries isn't an issue. By the way, I need you to find out who bought the old company building. I want to buy it back."

Frederick let out a low whistle. "Damn, you are serious. Alright, give me some time—I'll look into it right away. I'll call you as soon as I find anything."

Evelyn glanced at the clock. "It's late. Ask around tomorrow. I just called now because... I'm happy to be home."

No matter how well things had gone abroad, she had never truly felt like she belonged there.

The next morning, Evelyn took Lily to tour the private preschool in their upscale neighborhood.

The school was designed like a fairytale castle, complete with turrets and stained-glass windows.

It was exactly the kind of extravagant institution one would expect in Ravenswood’s elite district.

"Miss Thorne, if you're concerned about Lily adjusting, you're more than welcome to enroll her for a trial period," the director offered warmly.

She had taken an immediate liking to Lily, who looked every bit the part of a storybook princess.

Evelyn crouched down to meet her daughter’s gaze.

"What do you think, sweetheart? It would make things much easier for Grandma if you went to school here."

Lily clenched her tiny fists, her dark eyes searching Evelyn’s face.

"Are you sending Henry somewhere else, Mommy? Can I go with him?"

Evelyn smoothed a hand over her daughter’s hair. "I’m sorry, Lily. Your brother’s situation is different. But once he’s ready, I promise you two won’t be separated again, okay?"

Lily’s expression was solemn, but she nodded.

After leaving her daughter in the director’s care, Evelyn headed home.

Clara was in the kitchen washing dishes while Henry played quietly with his new toys.

Evelyn approached him. "Want to go check out a new school, Henry? We’ll just look around. If you don’t like it, we’ll come straight back."

Henry set his toys aside and stood up.

He was an obedient child—cooperative when it came to things like this.

But actual enrollment was another matter entirely.

Evelyn had tried public schools, private schools, even homeschooling with a private tutor.

Nothing had worked.

She didn’t want to send him to a special needs school, but she was running out of options.

Willowbrook Academy was the most prestigious institution of its kind in Ravenswood.

Its tuition was exorbitant—only the wealthiest families could afford it.

Admissions were strictly referral-based, and Evelyn had only secured a spot through connections.

Their cab pulled up to the academy’s grand gates.

Evelyn completed the registration at the front desk, then turned—just as a sleek black Rolls-Royce glided toward the school’s exit.
###Chapter 142

The sleek black Rolls-Royce glided to a halt before the wrought iron gates of Willowbrook Academy, its engine purring softly as it waited for entry.

Evelyn instinctively tightened her grip on little Henry's hand, pivoting them both away from the approaching vehicle.

Within moments, the luxury car disappeared down the tree-lined avenue in a whisper of polished steel.

Henry glanced up at his mother's suddenly pale face, curiosity sparking in his intelligent eyes.

He'd never seen fear flicker across his mother's features before - not like this. Whoever occupied that car clearly held significance.

As they stepped through the academy's arched entrance, a welcoming committee greeted them with warm smiles.

Willowbrook Academy lived up to its reputation as Ravenswood's premier institution for special needs education.

The sprawling campus boasted state-of-the-art facilities, from sensory gardens to cutting-edge therapy rooms, all staffed by world-renowned specialists.

Though the tuition made Evelyn's breath catch, she couldn't deny the exceptional quality of care offered.

Kneeling to meet Henry at eye level, she asked softly, "What do you think, sweetheart? Would you like to try coming here? I'll bring you every morning and pick you up each afternoon."

Her heart pounded as she waited, prepared to walk away if Henry showed the slightest hesitation.

Her son's differences didn't diminish his perfection in her eyes - she'd happily devote her life to his care.

Which made his firm nod all the more astonishing.

Evelyn's hands trembled as she repeated, "You're certain, darling?"

Henry's crystalline gaze held hers unwaveringly as he nodded again with deliberate emphasis.

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes as she gathered her son close, breathing in his familiar scent of sunshine and innocence.

This small gesture represented a seismic shift in their journey together.

Meanwhile, at precisely 10:03 AM, Mr. Thornton finally succeeded in reaching Dominic Blackwood after seventeen failed attempts.

"Mr. Blackwood, this is Evelyn Thorne's legal representative," the lawyer rushed out, anticipating the imminent disconnection. "I'm contacting you regarding Ms. Thorne's return to the country and her continued insistence on divorce proceedings."

The line remained ominously silent.

Mr. Thornton barreled forward, "My client demands you sign the papers immediately or she'll have no choice but to pursue litigation."

A sharp intake of breath crackled through the receiver.

"Sir, I must confess I don't understand your resistance," Thornton pressed. "Ms. Thorne isn't seeking alimony or assets. She simply wants dissolution of the marriage. You stand to lose nothing."

Dominic's voice emerged like tempered steel. "Tell her I'll consider it when she has the courage to ask me in person." The line went dead with surgical precision.

When Thornton relayed this response, Evelyn's lips thinned.

"Why not simply meet with him?" the lawyer urged. "He's practically handing you the divorce on a silver platter!"

Evelyn tapped a manicured nail against her phone case. "Legally speaking, what are the implications if we remain married?"

Thornton blinked. "Well, all income becomes marital property for starters—"

"He earns twenty times my salary," Evelyn interrupted with a dry laugh. "If he's not worried, why should I be?"

"Without a prenup, you're entitled to—"

"Let him try claiming a penny," she challenged, eyes flashing. "I'd like to see him explain that to the press."

Thornton adjusted his glasses. "Forgive me, but your relationship seems... complicated."

"Dead," Evelyn corrected. "Our relationship is dead."

The lawyer sighed. "Very well. Litigation remains an option, though considerably more tedious than a simple meeting."

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped brow. "I'll consider it."

"Best of luck with your... situation," Thornton offered awkwardly before adding, "Most women would kill to be in your position. Dominic Blackwood is—"

"A chapter I've closed," Evelyn finished, ending the call with a decisive tap. The beginnings of a tension headache pulsed at her temples.
###Chapter 143

Evelyn had no desire to see Dominic.

The Rolls-Royce she spotted at the school that morning wasn’t the same one from four years ago.

No man would drive the same car for that long.

But the driver was unmistakably the same.

What was Dominic doing at a special needs school?

Could he be an investor at Willowbrook Academy?

Even if he was, it was unlikely he’d personally oversee its operations.

The Blackwood Group alone consumed most of his time.

At lunch, Nathan noticed Dominic’s grim expression and attempted to lighten the mood.

"Sir, Professor Whitmore might have a lengthy roster of students, but we’ll track down the one we’re searching for soon enough."

"Evelyn is back," Dominic stated flatly.

His voice was hollow, stripped of emotion, yet beneath the surface, something darker simmered.

Nathan froze, then quickly recovered. "Did she reach out to you?"

"No. But she will," Dominic replied, finally picking up his fork. "She wants a divorce. I told her lawyer she’ll only get it if she faces me in person."

"What if she refuses? It’s not like the divorce affects either of you at this point."

Dominic shot him a glare sharp enough to silence him instantly.

Lucas ordered a bottle of wine, then turned to Dominic. "How do you feel about her now? If I were you, I’d despise her. But you don’t, do you? In fact, it seems like you want to see her…"

When the wine arrived, Dominic poured himself a glass.

He took a slow sip before answering. "Hate is too strong a word. But love? That’s long gone."

If Dominic still loved Evelyn, he would’ve signed the divorce papers years ago and set her free.

Four years ago, he had given her everything—his wealth, his heart, his soul. Unconditionally.

And in return, she had discarded him like he meant nothing.

It was the first time Dominic had ever felt his heart shatter.

Everyone deserved privacy, but Evelyn had dragged his deepest wounds into the light.

If he’d had the strength to open up, maybe he wouldn’t have drowned in depression.

She had whispered love into his ear, made him feel invincible, then ripped it all away.

Dominic vowed never to love another woman again. Especially not Evelyn Thorne.

"Good. I thought Evelyn was different," Lucas muttered, raising his glass. "But she hurt you worse than anyone. Nathan and I will always have your back."

As their glasses clinked, Nathan suddenly remembered something.

"Sir, your property manager mentioned someone’s interested in buying Thornfield Tower."

Dominic’s grip tightened around his glass, his knuckles turning white.

"Who?"

"I looked into it. The buyer is Thornfield Industries’ former HR manager."

Dominic scoffed. "Does he even have the funds?"

Nathan hesitated. "I haven’t verified his finances yet. I wanted to confirm if you’re willing to sell first. If you are, I can arrange a meeting. What’s your asking price?"

A flicker of suspicion crossed Dominic’s eyes.

Lucas caught it instantly. "You don’t think the real buyer is—"

"Did they reveal their identity?" Dominic cut in sharply.

Nathan shook his head. "No. The property manager only knows the intermediary."

"Have him demand proof of assets," Dominic ordered. "If the HR manager isn’t the real buyer, force the actual one to meet in person."

###Chapter 144 

Evelyn received a call from Frederick at two in the afternoon.

"Potential buyers want to meet regarding Thornfield Tower, Evelyn. When works for your schedule?"

Frederick's voice carried urgency. "Also, do you have your financial statements prepared? Current market valuation puts the property at eighty million dors minimum."

Evelyn nearly dropped her phone.

"Wasn't the purchase price half that amount originally?"

"Location determines everything," Frederick explained. "Prime real estate in Ravenshore's business district has appreciated significantly these past years."

"I'm tied up today. Schedule it for tomorrow."

"Consider it done. I'll notify them immediately."

Evelyn had promised Sophie their long-awaited reunion that afternoon.

Though separated by continents, their friendship never wavered.

Their bond remained unbroken despite infrequent contact.

Sophie arrived at Villa Serenade clutching a dozen crimson roses.

The moment their eyes met, both women rushed into a tearful embrace.

"Four years, Evelyn! I was about to disown you as my best friend!"

Only twice had they met during Evelyn's absence.

Both times, Sophie had flown overseas to visit.

Evelyn buried her face in the fragrant blooms. "These smell like true friendship."

"I almost pretended not to recognize you!" Sophie pulled her to their table. "Four years without visiting? Unforgivable! Tell me you're staying for good this time."

"Unless we're talking about vacation plans..."

"Still joking!" Sophie scanned the menu while studying her friend. "Where are you staying now?"

After ordering, she passed the menu to Evelyn who added nothing before dismissing the waiter.

"I bought at Mooncrest Manor."

Sophie's fork clattered against her water glass. "The gated community with those insane waterfront villas?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Had some success abroad."

"Holy hell! Those properties start at five million! What kind of 'some success' are we talking about?" Sophie fluttered her lashes dramatically. "Teach me your ways, oh wealthy one."

"Started a tech company. Exceeded projections." Evelyn sipped her sparkling water.

"Incredible! Adrian's startup hasn't cracked seven figures yet. My parents refuse our engagement until he 'gets serious' about finances." Sophie's shoulders slumped. "Five years together and still waiting..."

"Didn't they say they'd approve if he joined the family business?"

"That stubborn fool refuses! Claims he'll support me with his 'modest earnings'." Sophie mimed wiping tears. "At this rate, I'll die an old maid."

Evelyn leaned forward with a smirk. "Marry me instead. We'll relocate somewhere that recognizes same-sex unions."

Sophie choked on her drink, laughter bubbling over.

Her expression sobered as she grasped Evelyn's hand. "Truth time. Why divorce Dominic? Was there someone else? The tabloids never reported any affairs."

"Would you stay with Adrian if you knew his heart belonged to another, even if she never appeared?"

Sophie's jaw dropped. "Dominic was unfaithful?!"

"Ancient history." Evelyn swirled her water glass. "The divorce is just paperwork at this point."

"All his friends painted you as the villain! Called him the most devoted husband alive while branding you heartless." Sophie made a gagging motion. "Makes me sick."

"Not at the table, please." Evelyn's enigmatic smile never wavered.

"Enough about that bastard! What's next for Thornfield Industries' prodigal CEO?"

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with determination. "Rebuilding my father's legacy from the ground up."
###Chapter 145

Sophie stared at Evelyn in disbelief.

"How much exactly did you earn from your company?!"

"It's just my dream to rebuild Thornfield Industries. A dream, okay? I don't know if it'll ever happen."

Sophie exhaled in relief, then grinned mischievously. "Adrian and I look like complete amateurs compared to you. I better stay on your good side... How about I introduce you to someone? My younger cousin is absolutely adorable. Only seventeen but mature for his age—"

"Stop teasing me, Sophie," Evelyn groaned, massaging her temples.

"Not into younger guys? Prefer someone more experienced? Perfect! My gym trainer is turning forty this year, but his muscles make me weak in the knees... You could take him in, make him your house husband..."

Evelyn sighed deeply.

After ending things with Dominic, she'd lost all attraction to men, regardless of age.

After their tea session, Evelyn and Sophie headed to an upscale car dealership.

Sophie recommended a luxury sedan, but Evelyn's gaze kept drifting toward a sleek SUV.

"What about this model? It looks decent," Evelyn asked, pointing at the sporty vehicle.

Sophie's eyes widened at the price tag. "It's perfect if your bank account can handle it! At that price, it better come with a chauffeur!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn handed her platinum card to the salesman. "I'll take this one."

She needed to pick up Henry from school later, and taking taxis everywhere was becoming inconvenient.

That evening, Evelyn arrived at Willowbrook Academy in her new SUV.

Henry's teacher escorted him out, smiling warmly. "Henry had an excellent day. We're making wonderful progress getting to know each other."

Evelyn turned to her son with hopeful surprise.

"Is that true, sweetheart?"

Henry stuffed his hands in his pockets and gave a small nod.

Evelyn's eyes brimmed with tears of joy.

She never expected Henry would finally settle into a school.

Willowbrook Academy truly deserved its sterling reputation.

The six-figure tuition fees were proving worth every penny.

The next morning, Evelyn met Frederick at a downtown café before their meeting with Thornfield Tower's current owner.

"Didn't you bring the financial statements?" Frederick asked nervously, noticing Evelyn's empty hands.

"Let's hear their asking price first."

"They said market value when we scheduled this meeting."

Evelyn ordered an espresso as they waited.

Right at ten o'clock, as her coffee arrived, the café doors slid open.

Evelyn glanced up—and froze.

Two men walked in... and one face was painfully familiar.

###Chapter 146 

The shock on Nathan's face vanished the moment his gaze landed on Evelyn.

The potential buyer for Thornfield Tower turned out to be none other than Evelyn Thorne herself!

Evelyn's thoughts were spinning wildly.

What was Dominic's assistant doing here?

Could it possibly mean...

When Frederick noticed the two men approaching, he rose to greet the property manager.

"Good morning, Mr. Prescott," Frederick said politely, then glanced at Nathan and inquired, "And this gentleman is?"

"This is Mr. Dominic Blackwood's personal assistant, Nathan Cross," Mr. Prescott explained. "Mr. Blackwood was the one who originally arranged the building's purchase four years ago."

Frederick nodded in understanding before extending his hand. "A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Cross."

Nathan shook his hand firmly. "Likewise."

"Allow me to introduce Miss Evelyn Thorne," Frederick continued. "Miss Thorne is my former employer's eldest daughter. She's interested in acquiring Thornfield Tower. After Thornfield Industries collapsed, she went overseas for business and has now returned hoping to repurchase the family building and rebuild the company."

Evelyn felt like she'd been plunged into complete silence. Frederick's words barely registered in her overwhelmed mind.

The entire situation felt like some cruel cosmic joke.

Life was playing its twisted games with her again!

As if Dominic would ever sell Thornfield Tower if he knew she was the buyer!

From what Sophie had told her, Dominic probably loathed her very existence.

"Gentlemen, I'd like a private word with Miss Thorne. Would you mind giving us a moment?" Nathan requested with a professional smile.

Frederick immediately stood up.

"I'll wait outside," he told Evelyn before exiting with Mr. Prescott following close behind.

Suddenly, the café contained only Evelyn and Nathan.

An uncomfortable tension settled between them.

Evelyn lifted her coffee cup and took a slow sip.

Nathan ordered himself an espresso before turning to Evelyn with casual curiosity. "I thought you went abroad for graduate studies, Miss Thorne? How did you accumulate enough capital to purchase an entire skyscraper?"

"That's personal financial information I'd prefer to keep private," Evelyn replied coolly.

Nathan adjusted his glasses, then cut straight to the chase.

"Mr. Blackwood will finalize the divorce if you meet him in person. Similarly, I'm not authorized to discuss your interest in Thornfield Tower. You'll need to take that matter up directly with Mr. Blackwood."

"I have no desire to see him," Evelyn stated bluntly.

"Is guilt preventing you from facing him, Miss Thorne? All Mr. Blackwood wants is proper closure," Nathan said smoothly. "He holds no lingering affection for you, so you needn't worry about any unwanted advances."

Evelyn felt like an invisible blade had pierced her heart, but she maintained perfect composure. "Understood. I'll schedule a meeting when convenient. And for the record, I'm the last person who should feel guilt in this situation."

She stood abruptly and moved to pay the bill.

Nathan observed Evelyn's retreating figure - slender yet radiating quiet strength. Her final words lingered in his mind.

Indeed, her expression had shown not a flicker of remorse.

Was there more to the story between Evelyn and his boss than met the eye?

After Evelyn departed, Nathan returned to headquarters to brief Dominic.

When Dominic learned Evelyn was the prospective buyer for Thornfield Tower, his expression remained utterly impassive. He'd already deduced that possibility himself.
###Chapter 147

"She hasn't changed much. Still youthful, still stunning—but her aura is entirely different now."

Nathan relayed his encounter with Evelyn to Dominic, his tone thoughtful.

"She carries herself like someone who's conquered the world. I can’t fathom how she amassed such wealth in just a few years."

Lucas slid a stack of files across the desk. "I dug deeper. Three years ago, she co-founded Apex Innovations with a partner. Their primary product? Drones."

His fingers tapped the file. "My guess? She used her father’s unfinished program and found someone to refine it. Otherwise, their sales wouldn’t be skyrocketing like this."

Dominic remained silent, his gaze fixed on his laptop screen.

Nathan exhaled. "She’s not the same Evelyn Thorne we knew four years ago—the one who seemed so vulnerable."

Lucas smirked. "Vulnerable? Hardly. She was always sharp. Remember how she drove the boss mad?"

Nathan chuckled. "True. And now? She’s practically unstoppable. Even with a price tag of a hundred and fifty million, she won’t blink."

He glanced at Dominic. "So, are you selling? She’s clearly interested."

Dominic finally looked up, his voice icy. "I’ll wait for her to come to me."

That afternoon, Julian Whitmore sat across from a young woman at an upscale restaurant, sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows.

The woman—heiress to one of the city’s most prestigious financial dynasties—sipped her tea, her gaze assessing.

"My uncle is Dominic Blackwood," Julian boasted, leaning in. "We’re practically inseparable. If we start dating, I’ll introduce you."

She arched a brow. "Then why aren’t you working at Blackwood Group?"

Julian waved a hand. "I don’t need his help. I’m building my own legacy."

She smirked. "How many girlfriends have you had?"

"Just two," he lied smoothly. "College sweetheart, then one after graduation. Been too busy for romance since."

"Do you still talk to them?"

He scoffed. "No. Once it’s over, it’s over. Even if they crawled back begging, I wouldn’t spare them a glance."

The woman nodded, seemingly pleased—until a tiny hand tugged Julian’s sleeve.

"Daddy…" A little girl with wide, tear-filled eyes stared up at him. "Don’t you want Mommy and me anymore? This lady isn’t as pretty as Mommy… and Mommy’s younger. Do you only like her because she’s rich?"

Julian froze, his blood turning to ice.

Before he could react, the woman hurled her drink in his face. "You liar!" She snatched her purse and stormed out.

Julian wiped tea from his eyes, scrambling after her—but the girl’s wail stopped him cold.

"Daddy! Don’t leave me!" Her sobs echoed through the restaurant, drawing every patron’s stare.

Julian groaned. "I’m not your father! I’m not even married! How could I have a kid your age? Stop crying!"

The moment the heiress’s car screeched away, the girl’s tears vanished.

She sniffed. "You don’t look like Daddy anyway. He’d never leave me."

Julian gaped as she wiped her nose and held out a hand. "Can I borrow your phone, mister? I lost my daddy."

Grinding his teeth, Julian handed it over.

Five minutes later, the girl—Lily—skipped out of the restaurant, pressing a Bluetooth earpiece.

"Mission accomplished, Henry," she giggled. "The Trojan’s in his phone!"

###Chapter 148

The grand dining hall of the Blackwood estate was filled with the clinking of silverware and hushed conversations. Eleanor Blackwood turned her sharp gaze toward Julian Whitmore.

"How did your date with Jennifer Winslow go?" she inquired, her voice laced with expectation.

Julian kept his head down, his fingers tightening around his fork.

"Your grandmother asked you a question, Julian!" Beatrice snapped, shooting him a glare.

"Weren’t you just telling us how well your messages were going?"

"Everything was fine until some random little girl showed up," Julian muttered, his expression darkening. "She grabbed my shirt and started screaming that I was her daddy. It was humiliating. Jennifer misunderstood and blocked me. I haven’t been able to reach her since."

Gregory and Beatrice exchanged grim looks.

Their plans hinged on Julian marrying into the Winslow fortune to secure their standing among the elite.

After all, Dominic would never share a cent of his wealth with them, no matter how vast it was.

And now, their carefully laid scheme had been ruined by a four-year-old child.

"How could something so ridiculous happen?" Beatrice hissed. "Do you think the child did it on purpose?"

Julian shook his head. "She was lost and scared. She probably just mistook me for someone else."

The girl’s face flashed in his mind again—round cheeks, bright eyes—and a strange sense of familiarity tugged at him.

"Actually… she looked familiar," he mused.

Then it hit him.

"She looked like Evelyn Thorne!" he blurted. "The more I think about it, the more alike they are!"

Gregory choked on his wine, shooting Julian a warning glare.

Mentioning Evelyn Thorne in front of Dominic was forbidden.

Julian paled.

"Sorry, Uncle Dominic. I didn’t mean to, but that kid really did look like Evelyn—"

"Enough!" Gregory barked. "Finish your meal. We’re going to the Winslows later to fix this mess!"

Julian fell silent, stabbing at his food.

Meanwhile, in a cozy home across town, Evelyn sat at the dinner table with her family.

The children barely touched their food before rushing off to their room.

"They already ate at school," Clara said with a soft smile. "I’m just glad Henry finally found a school he likes."

Evelyn waited until the door was closed before lowering her voice.

"It’s a special needs school. There are no other students—just him and two teachers."

Clara sighed. "Classmates don’t matter. What matters is that he gets an education. If he can learn enough to take care of himself one day, that’s all I want."

"Don’t worry too much, Mom," Evelyn reassured her. "His health is what’s important."

Clara nodded, though her eyes remained heavy.

In the children’s room, Henry and Lily huddled by the window.

"Daddy’s a jerk," Lily huffed, her little cheeks puffing in anger. "I don’t want a jerk for a dad, Henry."

Henry’s fists clenched. "Jerk dads don’t deserve us."

"Exactly!" Lily crossed her arms. "I’d rather have no dad at all! We should teach him a lesson!"

Henry’s eyes gleamed with determination. "I’ll make him pay."

By 10 p.m., Evelyn was restless.

She had showered, changed, and now paced her room, her mind racing.

She didn’t want to see Dominic, but she had no choice.

Frederick Dawson had reached out to former Thornfield Industries employees—they were all willing to return.

She needed Thornfield Tower back.

If Dominic refused to sell, she’d have to find another location.

Her finger hovered over his contact, but she couldn’t bring herself to press call.

Why was she so nervous? She hadn’t been the one who wronged him.

Determined, she grabbed a bottle of wine from downstairs.

Halfway through, her cheeks flushed, her mind sharp despite the alcohol.

Finally, she dialed.

The call connected after ten tense seconds.
###Chapter 149

Evelyn Spoke First

"Tomorrow is Saturday. Are you free?"

"Morning or afternoon?" Dominic asked.

His voice was deep, rough—yet still carried that same magnetic pull that had drawn her in four years ago.

"Morning!" Evelyn answered.

The alcohol had dulled her inhibitions. She felt reckless, words tumbling out before she could stop them.

"Don’t forget your ID and our marriage certificate. If things go smoothly, we could sign the divorce papers right then and there!"

Dominic hadn’t expected her to be this bold.

This wasn’t at all what Nathan had described.

"You’ll regret this, Evelyn," Dominic said, his grip tightening around his phone, his Adam’s apple bobbing sharply.

"I won’t regret a damn thing!"

His words had struck a nerve.

"If we finalize the divorce tomorrow, I’m buying fireworks and setting them off for twenty-four hours straight!" She burst into laughter, the sound bright and unhinged.

Dominic listened, his jaw clenching. Something wasn’t right.

"Are you drunk, Evelyn?"

She never used to drink.

Not a single drop.

And now, here she was—slurring, laughing, completely wasted.

A storm of fury ignited inside him.

"What’s it to you?! I’ll drink if I want to. Nobody controls me!" she snapped, defiance dripping from every word.

"We’re getting divorced tomorrow," Dominic growled through gritted teeth.

And it was true—no one controlled Evelyn Thorne.

As CEO of Apex Innovations, she was worth billions.

Their marriage? A technicality.

No, not even that.

Everyone knew they were already over.

So why drag it out?

Evelyn clapped her hands together, mocking.

Dominic’s temper flared, and he ended the call before he said something he’d regret.

The moment the screen went dark, Evelyn let out a hollow laugh before collapsing back onto the bed.

"Finally free. Finally done."

She chuckled, staring at the ceiling as hot tears spilled from the corners of her eyes.

"Dominic… I do regret it… I regret ever meeting you. I regret marrying you. I regret loving you…"

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the windows as Evelyn stirred, rubbing her throbbing temples.

Her head pounded from last night’s reckless drinking.

She fumbled for her phone, squinting at a message from Dominic.

Sent at midnight—an address.

She dropped the phone and pressed her fingers to her temples, waiting for the pain to dull before dragging herself out of bed.

By ten, she arrived at the private café Dominic had reserved.

Dressed in a sleek black dress, hair pulled back, light makeup applied—but none of it could hide the exhaustion in her bloodshot eyes.

She ordered a black coffee.

Thirty minutes later, she finished it.

By eleven, she was on her second cup.

She didn’t order a third.

Instead, she pulled out her phone and dialed Dominic’s number.

They were supposed to meet at ten.

So where the hell was he?

Had he changed his mind?

Or was something wrong?

###Chapter 150

A sleek black car pulled up to the grand entrance of the Blackwood estate.

The moment the door opened, a strikingly beautiful face appeared.

"Long time no see, Miss Chamberlain," greeted Mrs. Wilkins warmly.

Bianca offered a practiced smile. "It's been too long, Mrs. Wilkins. Is Dominic home?"

Mrs. Wilkins nodded. "Master Dominic has been expecting you since your call this morning."

Bianca's lips curled in satisfaction.

Just then, another woman stepped out of the car.

"Careful, Miss Montgomery," Bianca said, extending a hand to assist her.

Zoe Montgomery appeared to be in her early thirties, exuding an air of quiet confidence. Her sharp gaze and poised demeanor suggested a woman of intellect—perhaps a scholar or a scientist.

She lifted her chin slightly, taking in the imposing mansion before her.

Her expression remained unreadable.

Mrs. Wilkins didn’t dare pry. Instead, she led the two women inside to the sitting room.

The moment they entered, Dominic rose from his seat.

Bianca had called him earlier that morning, claiming she had located the student Professor Whitmore had mentioned—the one who could assist him.

The news of Dominic being the last person to speak with the late Professor Whitmore had made headlines.

With enough money and influence, it hadn’t been difficult for Bianca to uncover the details of that conversation.

Tracking down Zoe Montgomery, however, had taken considerable effort.

Bianca had gone to great lengths to bring her here—not just to help Dominic, but to secure her own return to his side.

Five years.

That was how long it had been since she’d last seen him.

She had spent those years abroad, building her career, refining her skills—all in hopes of one day being worthy of standing beside him again.

Now, seeing him in person, she was struck by how much more commanding he seemed. His presence was magnetic, his sharp features even more striking than she remembered.

Her eyes stung with unshed emotion.

But Dominic barely spared her a glance. His focus was entirely on Zoe.

"Miss Montgomery," he said, extending his hand.

"Mr. Blackwood," Zoe replied, shaking it firmly.

Dominic gestured for her to sit.

"I’ve reviewed your credentials," he began, his voice measured. "You’re the youngest professor at Mercy Medical Center, correct?"

Bianca watched him intently, but he didn’t so much as glance her way.

Not that it mattered.

Just being near him again was enough.

Still, she couldn’t help but wonder—why was he so invested in finding Professor Whitmore’s student?

Dominic was in perfect health. Eleanor, his mother, was also well.

Who could he possibly be seeking medical expertise for?

Zoe inclined her head. "That’s correct. If you’ve read my file, you’ll know I entered medical school at fifteen. Medicine has been my life’s work."

Dominic nodded. "I’ve arranged accommodations for you. Rest for now. We’ll discuss matters further later."

"Of course," Zoe agreed.

Once she was escorted out, Bianca finally spoke.

"Dominic…"

He turned to her, his expression unreadable.

"Thank you, Bianca. Without your help, finding her would have taken much longer."

Professor Whitmore had countless students, each with impeccable credentials. Narrowing it down had been a challenge.

Bianca smiled. "It was my pleasure." She hesitated, then pressed on. "Dominic… would you consider letting me return to Blackwood Group? I haven’t been idle these past years. I studied abroad, worked in PR—"

She wanted to prove she was more than qualified for a leadership role.

Dominic disliked owing favors, and Bianca had done him a significant one.

He wasn’t thrilled by her request, but he could hardly refuse.

"Very well. But if you return, our relationship remains strictly professional."

The unspoken warning was clear: Keep your distance.

Bianca’s chest tightened, but she nodded.

Before leaving, she ventured one last question.

"Dominic… may I ask who you’re seeking medical help for?" She quickly added, "I don’t mean to pry. I’m just… concerned."
###Chapter 151

"Your concern is unnecessary," Dominic stated coldly.

Bianca's face fell at the blunt dismissal. Without another word, she turned on her heel and exited.

The sudden ringing of a phone shattered the heavy silence of the penthouse.

When Evelyn's name flashed across his screen, Dominic felt an unexpected twitch in his jaw.

It was nearly midday.

He'd promised to meet her this morning.

The call from Bianca had made him completely forget about their scheduled meeting.

Dominic answered with measured calm. "My apologies. An urgent matter arose. I'll have my attorney handle the divorce paperwork."

There was a brief pause before Evelyn responded, her voice steady. "Very well. Since it's the weekend, have your lawyer contact me Monday."

"Agreed," Dominic replied.

The conversation should have ended there, yet Dominic found himself continuing. "I'll sell Thornfield Tower to you."

His thirst for vengeance against Evelyn had evaporated.

Now, his sole focus was Sophia's treatment.

Sophia was his twin sister, born with cognitive impairments.

Their father had been ruthless with his children.

The shame of having a disabled child was unacceptable - he couldn't risk the Blackwood name becoming society's joke.

Sophia's existence had been carefully concealed.

No one outside the family knew Dominic had a sister named Sophia.

Memories flooded Dominic's mind - his father's drunken rages, Sophia's terrified whimpers, the bruises hidden beneath long sleeves.

His sister had endured too much...

There had been that one night when she'd nearly died.

Only their mother's intervention had saved Sophia, spiriting her away to safety.

The guilt still gnawed at Dominic.

Sophia represented both his deepest pain and greatest concern.

He would move heaven and earth for her recovery.

He dreamed of the day she might experience life as others did.

With modern medical advances, Dominic had scoured the globe for specialists who might help his sister.

Zoe Montgomery's emergence had kindled a fragile hope.

Evelyn felt an odd hollowness in her chest.

For four years Dominic had refused to sign the papers. Now, when she'd finally secured his agreement, he couldn't even be bothered to meet in person.

Instead, he delegated to his lawyer.

It was difficult not to interpret this as some final act of pettiness. Yet he'd agreed to sell Thornfield Tower without negotiation or inflated price.

This wasn't revenge.

This was apathy.

Dominic had simply stopped caring.

Stepping from the café into the sweltering noon heat, Evelyn barely registered the temperature.

Her car's interior was an oven, yet she felt nothing as she slid inside.

She sat motionless, her mind curiously blank, as if every memory of Dominic had been systematically erased.

The shrill ring of her phone jolted her back to reality. Drawing a steadying breath, she answered.

"Wesley. What is it?"

"Evelyn, remember Zoe Montgomery?" Wesley's voice held barely contained amusement. "When Professor Whitmore chose you over her as his protégé, she never quite measured up."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed. "Why bring this up now? We barely knew each other."

"Well, Dominic Blackwood just consulted her. He believes she's the expert Professor Whitmore referenced."

Wesley's derisive chuckle carried clearly. "That woman couldn't diagnose a headache, let alone treat whatever case he's brought her."

###Chapter 152 

The realization hit Evelyn like a bolt of lightning.

She was certain now—the person Dominic was desperate to save must be the woman who still held his heart.

There was no way she could ever wish them happiness.

Evelyn started the car, the engine humming to life. She cranked up the air conditioning, letting the icy breeze fill the space, matching the chill in her chest.

She needed to distract herself.

Taking the kids out seemed like the perfect solution.

Since returning to Eldermere, she hadn’t spent a proper day with them.

"Where are we going, Mommy?"

Lily and Henry were already buckled into their car seats, well-behaved as always.

Unlike other children their age, they were far more composed, almost too mature for their years.

Evelyn hadn’t decided yet.

"How about the amusement park? There’s one shaped like a castle!" she suggested, forcing enthusiasm into her voice.

Lily sighed dramatically, her tiny nose wrinkling. "It’s too hot, Mommy. Can we go somewhere cooler?"

"A water park, then?"

Lily scrunched her face. "I don’t like swimming with strangers. It’s gross. Let’s just get ice cream!"

Evelyn nearly laughed.

Of course.

Lily was always thinking about food.

"Let’s just drive around, Mommy! We can find something nice to eat and go home after," Lily suggested, noticing her mother’s hesitation.

Henry, ever the quiet one, simply nodded. "Agreed."

That settled it.

Her children had social anxiety—crowded places were a hard pass.

Evelyn drove aimlessly through Ravenswood, letting the city blur past the windows.

Two hours slipped by unnoticed.

By half past four, she parked in the city center and led the kids into an upscale restaurant.

The place was quiet, the kind of expensive establishment that kept the crowds at bay.

She chose a table by the window.

Lily and Henry sat across from her, perfectly in sync.

They rarely fought, and when they did, Lily was always the first to apologize.

Evelyn skimmed the menu—each dish accompanied by a glossy photo—then handed it to the kids.

"Mommy, if I eat all my food, can I have ice cream after?" Lily bargained, eyes wide. "Henry wants some too."

"I don’t," Henry muttered.

Evelyn smiled. "Eat first, then we’ll see."

Lily beamed.

The night before, Julian had visited the Winslow family with his father to apologize.

Jennifer Winslow, moved by their sincerity, had given him another chance.

Now, Julian sat across from her at dinner, his charm dialed up to ten.

"I’m sorry about yesterday, Jennifer. Out of all the men in that restaurant, that little girl had to mistake me for her father. Just my luck, right?" He flashed a self-deprecating smile. "I couldn’t sleep last night, thinking about how I embarrassed you. But then I realized—maybe I used up all my good luck just meeting you."

Julian was undeniably handsome, his tailored suit accentuating his lean frame.

His smooth words made Jennifer laugh, her earlier annoyance fading.

He slid a velvet box across the table.

"This is for you. Not just a gift—my sincerity."

###Chapter 153

Jennifer Winslow glanced at the velvet gift box, then sighed. "I'm not getting any younger, Julian. What I truly desire now is a family... children of my own."

His fingers tightened around the wineglass. "Funny you should say that, Jennifer. I've been craving the same thing lately." Julian leaned closer, his gaze intense. "Why don't we give this a proper chance? Date seriously. If things work out, we could build that life together."

Her manicured nails traced the tablecloth absently. "There's one condition from my father. Our firstborn—regardless of gender—must carry the Winslow name."

Julian's charming smile froze.

Jennifer reached for her clutch. "If that's unacceptable, we should end this now."

His hand shot out to stop her. "Wait! I'm perfectly fine with that arrangement." He forced a laugh. "The child would still be mine biologically, wouldn't they? Though..." His voice dropped conspiratorially. "Perhaps we could compromise? First child takes your name, second takes mine? That way everyone's happy."

Relief washed over Jennifer's features.

"Would your family agree?"

"Leave them to me." Julian's thumb brushed her wrist. "These past weeks with you have been... revelatory. Your grace, your poise—you're nothing like those frivolous twenty-somethings. You've utterly bewitched me."

A becoming blush colored Jennifer's cheeks as she accepted the diamond bracelet.

This is almost too easy, Julian mused, sipping his Bordeaux. Marrying into the Winslow dynasty would cement his social standing permanently.

Then movement caught his eye.

The same doe-eyed child from yesterday—the one who'd called him "Daddy"—was skipping toward the restrooms hand-in-hand with a dark-haired boy.

"Pardon me, darling. Nature calls." Julian excused himself with practiced charm before stalking after them.

Henry Thorne's spine stiffened moments before the footsteps reached them. In one fluid motion, he yanked his sister into the ladies' room.

"Henry! I don't need to—" Lily's protest died when her brother pressed a finger to her lips.

"Julian Whitmore. Twelve o'clock."

Lily's hands flew to her mouth. Her wide, onyx eyes darted toward the door. "Did he see me? Is he here to take me away?"

Without missing a beat, Henry unzipped his backpack and retrieved a sleek laptop. His small fingers flew across the keyboard.

"Lights out. Fire drill," he murmured.

Five seconds later, the restaurant plunged into darkness.

Ten seconds after that, ear-splitting alarms shattered the air. Patrons erupted into chaos, stampeding toward exits.

Evelyn Thorne fought against the current, screaming her children's names over the din.

She nearly collapsed with relief when two small figures emerged unscathed. A waiter shoved them toward safety. "Madam! Evacuate immediately!"

Scooping Lily into her arms and gripping Henry's hand, Evelyn fled into the night.

From his idling Mercedes, Julian squinted at the retreating figures. The woman's profile struck him—there was something hauntingly familiar about the way she cradled the girl while leading the boy.

He couldn't quite place it... but he intended to find out.
###Chapter 154

Julian couldn't shake the image of Evelyn from his mind.

Evelyn was overseas, so the woman he'd glimpsed couldn't possibly be her.

After dropping Jennifer off that evening, Julian returned to the ancestral estate in high spirits.

Beatrice noticed her son's unusually cheerful demeanor and inquired with a knowing smile, "Did your date go well today?"

"It's practically settled. She mentioned children and suggested our firstborn should carry the Winslow name. Naturally, I agreed."

Seeing his mother's expression shift, Julian quickly added, "Don't worry, Mother. Once we're married, I'll ensure she's completely devoted to me. She'll willingly transfer all the Winslow assets to us!"

Beatrice visibly relaxed before offering her counsel. "I have faith in you, Julian. To accomplish great things, one must learn to overlook such trivial matters!"

"Consider it done!" Julian declared confidently.

At precisely 10 p.m., Gregory's phone shattered the evening's peace.

The furious voice of Jennifer's father exploded through the receiver. "Gregory! What kind of monster have you raised?! How dare your son send those obscene photos to my daughter? My precious girl is so traumatized she's been crying nonstop! The engagement is off!"

Gregory stood frozen.

"What photos are you referring to?"

"Explicit nudes! Is your son mentally disturbed? I might have excused it as some bizarre kink if he had anything worth showing, but he's pathetically inadequate! The sheer audacity to share such humiliation!"

Gregory's face burned crimson as his lips twisted in disgust.

While he couldn't confirm his son's... endowments, sending such photos to a respectable young woman was beyond reprehensible!

How could Julian behave so indecently with someone he'd only recently met?

Clutching his phone with white-knuckled fury, Gregory stormed to Julian's bedroom, kicking the door open with a thunderous crash. "You disgraceful worm! You've destroyed everything! Explain yourself - why would you send Jennifer Winslow nude photographs?!"

Julian, mid-game on his phone, gaped at the accusations. His face paled before flushing scarlet.

Scrambling from bed, he confronted his father with frantic gestures. "Father! These are baseless accusations! I would never send such filth! I've never shared inappropriate photos with any woman!"

Gregory shoved his phone in Julian's face. "Mr. Winslow called me personally! Are you calling him a liar? The truth is plain - you've failed this family! I'm disgusted by your behavior!"

With that, Gregory stormed out, leaving Julian standing shell-shocked.

Trembling with rage, Julian exited his game and pulled up his message history with Jennifer.

"Look, Mother! The only texts I sent were to arrange today's meeting! There's nothing inappropriate here!"

Beatrice glanced at the screen but remained unconvinced. "You could have deleted the evidence. It's over, Julian. Reflect on your disgraceful actions!"

She too departed, leaving Julian seething.

Why was his own family accusing him of crimes he didn't commit?

Moreover, Jennifer had kissed him goodbye that very evening.

Logically, she wouldn't fabricate such claims.

Where had everything gone wrong?

Meanwhile, in the nursery of Mooncrest Manor, Lily and Henry were whispering beneath their blankets.

"Do you think the heiress will dump that scoundrel now?" Lily murmured.

"Undoubtedly," Henry replied.

"Was it too cruel, Henry? He is technically our father."

"Not unless I acknowledge him as such."

Lily sighed. "By the way, where did you find those... revealing photos?"

"His private cloud storage."

"I see... Why won't you let me see them?"

Henry's expression darkened. "They'd scar your retinas."

"But you saw them!" Lily pouted. "I'm a boy! You're a girl - you shouldn't be looking at such things!"

"Fine!"

After a brief sulk, Lily snuggled closer to her brother. "You're brilliant, Henry! Who needs a father when I have you protecting me?"
###Chapter 155

Dominic remained silent in response to Lily's words, but an unshakable determination crystallized in his thoughts.

He needed to become stronger. More formidable.

He had to shield his sister, his mother, and his grandmother from harm!

When Monday arrived, Evelyn met with her divorce attorney.

After finalizing the divorce documents, the lawyer slid another contract across the table. "Miss Thorne, I've prepared the purchase agreement for the building you wanted."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "He asked you to handle this?"

The lawyer nodded, tapping the document. "Please review it carefully. The price is the crucial detail here."

Evelyn's gaze immediately dropped to the purchase amount.

Forty million dollars.

The exact sum Dominic had originally paid for Thornfield Tower.

He'd be taking a massive loss selling it back at this price!

In four years, forty million could have earned substantial interest in any high-yield account.

"What's his game?" Evelyn demanded, suspicion lacing her voice.

The lawyer adjusted his glasses. "I believe Mr. Blackwood is offering this price out of consideration for your previous marital relationship."

"I don't need his charity. Current market value puts that building at one hundred twenty million," Evelyn countered sharply. "I won't let him take a loss. I'll pay one hundred million."

"Shall I consult Mr. Blackwood about this?"

"Unnecessary." Evelyn pushed the contract back. "Just amend the price. We'll sign separately. There are no ties between us anymore. He's a businessman - profit matters. He won't object."

After brief consideration, the lawyer agreed. "Very well. I'll contact you when the revised contract is ready."

Meanwhile, at Willowbrook Academy, a disturbing scene unfolded within its picturesque castle-like walls.

"Stop that sniveling! My patience is wearing thin!"

"Your parents died last month! They prepaid thirty years, but no one's coming for you! Keep crying and you'll skip meals today!"

Harsh reprimands mixed with a girl's sobs. Henry happened to pass by and peered through the doorway.

Inside, staff berated a teenage girl with cerebral palsy who'd spilled breakfast on herself.

Henry settled on the floor outside and flipped open his laptop.

His fingers flew across the keyboard with practiced precision.

Seconds later, panicked shrieks erupted from the room.

"Why is the roomba attacking me?!"

"What's wrong with the microwave?! It's turning on by itself!"

"This place is haunted! Aaaah!"

Both caretakers bolted from the room, pursued by the rogue cleaning device.

Henry stretched lazily and closed his computer.

As he stood, he found himself staring into the most innocent, luminous eyes he'd ever seen.

Their owner was a stunning woman.

Her hime-cut hair framed delicate features, and her pink tulle dress gave her an ethereal quality.

Like some woodland sprite who'd lost her way.

"You're amazing, Big Brother!" Sophia Blackwood blinked her enormous, tear-filled eyes. "Can you help me escape? They want to cut open my brain... It'll hurt so much... I'm terrified..."

Henry's brow furrowed.

This woman appeared at least thirty years old!

Yet she called him "Big Brother" with the mental capacity of a toddler.
###Chapter 156

Dominic Blackwood sat in his study at Mooncrest Manor, handing a stack of files to Zoe Montgomery. The morning light filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting long shadows across the mahogany desk.

"She's physically fragile and autistic, but otherwise healthy," Dominic stated, his fingers tapping impatiently on the armrest. "I just wish her IQ was slightly higher so she could better understand the world around her."

"Mr. Blackwood, is your sister currently enrolled at Willowbrook Academy?" Zoe asked, flipping through the medical reports.

Dominic nodded curtly. "Yes."

"I'd like to meet her first," Zoe said, closing the folder. "After our conversation, I'll conduct a comprehensive medical evaluation."

Dominic's piercing gaze met hers. "Fine."

Zoe checked her watch. "Let's go now."

"Miss Montgomery, we should discuss your fees first."

They hadn't touched on payment since Bianca Chamberlain had introduced them.

Zoe's lips curved into a confident smile. "No payment until results. If I can't help your sister, you won't owe me a cent. We'll settle the bill after she's cured."

Dominic's jaw tightened. In his experience, the most expensive services always came disguised as favors.

"I prefer transparent pricing upfront."

"And how do you manage Bianca? Doesn't her constant presence interfere with your work?"

Zoe adjusted her blazer. "I'm actually on vacation, Mr. Blackwood. Just wrapped up a major research project and taking two months off."

Dominic pulled out his checkbook. "At least let me pay a deposit."

Seeing his determination, Zoe finally relented. "Very well." She scribbled her account details on a notepad. "Do as you please."

The tension in Dominic's shoulders eased slightly.

At precisely 10:15 AM, their black sedan pulled out of the manor gates, heading toward Willowbrook Academy.

Meanwhile, chaos erupted at the special needs school.

Sophia Blackwood had vanished.

The caretaker Dominic had personally hired - a former Blackwood family nanny known for her loyalty - stood trembling in the headmaster's office.

"She never wanders off alone!" The distraught woman clutched her chest. "Something's terribly wrong!"

The moment she'd discovered Sophia missing, she'd alerted school authorities. Staff members now scoured every corner of the sprawling campus.

Security raced to review surveillance footage, only to find the system mysteriously offline.

"Maintenance was notified immediately," a flustered technician reported. "The system crashed thirty minutes ago. We've tried every reboot protocol."

The headmaster's face turned ashen. "Is the footage recoverable?"

The technician shook his head. "If it's just a glitch, the data should be intact. But this feels deliberate."

The nanny swayed on her feet. "A kidnapping? Oh God, I must call Mr. Blackwood!"

The headmaster steadied her. "Let's check with gate security first. No exit was reported, which means Miss Blackwood must still be on premises."

Relief flickered across the nanny's face.

A quick call to the front gate confirmed no one had seen Sophia leave.

What the guard failed to mention was their own twenty-minute system blackout.

As the headmaster mopped his brow, he assured the nanny, "We'll find her. She couldn't have gone far."

Outside, unnoticed by anyone, a maintenance worker slipped through a service entrance, his toolbag suspiciously heavy.

###Chapter 157

The nanny's heart sank like a stone. Tears welled up in her eyes as she choked out, "I'll find her, Mr. Blackwood!"

Thirty minutes later, Dominic's sleek black car screeched to a halt outside Willowbrook Academy.

His grip tightened on the steering wheel as he stepped out, his polished shoes hitting the pavement with sharp clicks. Beside him, Sophia walked silently toward the pastel-pink building where she lived.

Her quarters were isolated—a carefully curated space where staff handled her daily needs, from meals to medical care.

Dominic pushed the door open. The silence that greeted him was deafening.

His brows knitted together.

The nanny came rushing in, her face streaked with tears. "Mr. Blackwood! Miss Sophia—she's gone!" Her voice cracked. "We turned the whole campus upside down, but... she's nowhere. I called for her until my voice gave out. She would never ignore me like this."

Dominic's entire body tensed, his hands curling into fists.

"I told her last night about the brilliant doctor you hired," the nanny sobbed. "I said the surgery would help her get better. She asked... what kind of surgery it was. I shouldn’t have explained. It terrified her. She cried herself to sleep from nightmares. I think she ran because she’s scared." The nanny collapsed to her knees, wracked with guilt.

Dominic's chest ached, but anger wouldn’t fix this.

The nanny had dedicated years to Sophia’s care without a single misstep.

Sophia was hiding—out of fear.

"You searched everywhere on campus?" Dominic's voice was dangerously low. "Could she have left the grounds?"

The nanny shook her head frantically. "The gate guard swears he didn’t see her leave! Should we—should we drain the lake? What if she—"

Dominic's expression darkened like a storm.

Before he could speak, the headmaster was already barking orders into his phone. "Drain the lake immediately!"

Just then, the head of security burst in, panting.

"Sir! Mr. Blackwood! The security room had a blackout this morning around ten. The guard left his post for ten minutes to check the electrical vault. But we confirmed—Miss Sophia didn’t slip out during that time."

Dominic’s jaw clenched.

Sophia had the mind of a child. The outside world would chew her up and spit her out.

People wouldn’t see her innocence—only an adult who didn’t behave like one.

What if someone realized she was different?

Dominic’s head throbbed. He couldn’t bear to imagine what might happen to her.

He stormed out, barking orders to his entire team. "Turn the city inside out!"

Next, he called the police, demanding footage from every camera near the academy.

He had to find her.

Now.

Before something unthinkable happened.

Meanwhile, at Mooncrest Manor, Clara Thorne stared at the young woman her grandson Henry had dragged home. Her face remained composed, but shock pulsed through her veins.

"Grandma, they want to cut her head open," Henry explained solemnly. "I couldn’t let her die. She’s staying with us."

Clara pulled Henry close. "Sweetheart, she must have a family. We need to take her back before they panic!"

Henry turned to Sophia. "Do you have a family?"

Sophia blinked blankly and shook her head.

"See? She’s sick," Henry insisted, frowning. "Mom can fix her first, then we’ll send her home."

Clara sighed. "Henry, how did you even get home from school? Does your teacher know you left?"

Henry’s eyes widened. "Oh—right. I have to go back." He pointed at Sophia. "Be good!"

Sophia nodded obediently.

The moment Henry’s cab disappeared down the drive, Clara grabbed her phone.

"Evelyn! Drop everything and come home. Henry just brought a stranger into the house!"
###Chapter 158

Evelyn raced home after the call.

She couldn’t fathom how her son had brought a woman into their house.

Henry never interacted with strangers.

He would never invite someone home.

So who was this woman?

What had she done to sway Henry?

Evelyn arrived, her breath catching the moment she saw the woman.

"Evelyn, you're back!" Clara rushed to the door, noticing her daughter's pallor and ragged breathing. She gripped Evelyn’s arm. "What’s wrong? You look ill!"

Evelyn’s gaze locked onto Sophia as if piercing through her soul.

That woman—with her hime-cut hair and pink puffy dress—had haunted her thoughts for years.

She never expected to see her in the flesh.

And most shockingly, brought home by her son.

How?

What was her motive?

Was she here for Dominic?

Evelyn’s head throbbed.

She couldn’t make sense of it. She had divorced Dominic.

She wanted nothing to do with him.

This woman had no reason to appear now.

"Mom, go to your room. I need to speak with her alone," Evelyn ordered.

Clara hesitated, sensing the tension. She didn’t understand why her daughter held such hostility toward someone with a mental disability.

Was Evelyn truly that vindictive?

With a conflicted sigh, Clara retreated to her room, unsure whom to side with.

Once alone, Evelyn advanced toward Sophia, her anger simmering.

"Why did you approach my son? What do you want?" Her voice was sharp. "Dominic and I are divorced. I have no ties to him anymore. If you dare harm my child, I won’t hold back!"

As she spoke, Evelyn forced herself to calm down.

The woman before her trembled, tears welling in her eyes before she burst into loud, childlike sobs.

It wasn’t the restrained crying of an adult.

It was raw, unfiltered—like a frightened child.

Sophia clutched her chest, wailing as if the world had wronged her.

Evelyn frowned.

What was happening?

This wasn’t the reaction she’d expected.

She followed Sophia as the woman stumbled toward the bedroom.

"Why are you crying? Answer me!" Evelyn demanded, though her tone softened slightly. "Why are you here? Did you come to see me? Then speak!"

Clara cracked the door open.

"Evelyn, she doesn’t understand you!" she interjected. Sophia immediately hid behind Clara, peeking at Evelyn with wide, fearful eyes.

Evelyn scoffed. "Did I suddenly start speaking another language? Or is she… mentally impaired?"

"Yes! She doesn’t comprehend anything I say either. She just keeps shaking her head!" Clara sighed. "Henry said someone was trying to hurt her, so he brought her here. He wants you to help her."

Evelyn was stunned.

###Chapter 159

She had braced for every scenario—except this.

Her supposed rival was… disabled?

Was that why Dominic had never mentioned her?

Evelyn sank onto the sofa, burying her face in her hands. The revelation was too much to process.

"Evelyn, what’s going on?" Clara sat beside her. "You know her, don’t you? That conversation was strange."

"I have a headache, Mom. Just… leave me alone," Evelyn muttered.

Clara nodded. "I’ll prepare the guest room."

Evelyn grabbed her wrist. "No. She knew Dominic. Their relationship was… complicated. I’ll take her somewhere else."

At the mention of Dominic, Sophia flinched.

She shook her head violently, tears streaming anew.

Clara held her hand, soothing her. "Do you know Dominic?"

Sophia shook her head harder.

If she admitted it, they might send her back.

And if she went back—they would cut open her skull.

She’d rather stay with these strangers than face that horror.

Evelyn found her reaction absurd.

This woman didn’t remember Dominic Blackwood?

Meanwhile, at Willowbrook Academy, chaos reigned.

The power had been cut, and staff scoured the campus twice.

Henry slipped inside unnoticed, his baseball cap pulled low.

He weaved through the parking lot, pausing when he spotted a sleek black Rolls-Royce.

That car.

His mother had tensed when she saw it earlier.

Curious, he edged closer, examining the license plate.

Then Dominic, the academy officials, and a group of bodyguards emerged.

"Mr. Blackwood, our security system was hacked around ten this morning," the vice headmaster reported.

Dominic’s jaw tightened. "Find out who did this."

"We’ve contacted top cybersecurity experts. We’ll have answers soon," the man assured. "The hacker may be someone within the academy. Breaching our systems so effortlessly suggests prior infiltration."

Dominic’s voice was ice. "Lock down the entire campus."

"Yes. I’ll personally oversee the investigation."

Henry remained hidden, his fingers flying across his phone.

The license plate confirmed it—this was Dominic’s car.

Why did his mother fear him?

Henry dug deeper, unearthing news of a car crash five years ago.

Then—divorce records from that very day.

Wait.

Dominic Blackwood had just finalized his divorce.

His ex-wife was… Evelyn Thorne?

His mother had been married to Dominic?

Henry’s mind reeled.

His mother and Julian Whitmore had two children.

Yet she had married Dominic.

So… who did she truly love?

Lost in thought, Henry didn’t notice Dominic approaching—until the man stood right in front of him.

###Chapter 160

"Why are you hiding here?" Dominic's voice cut through the quiet of the parking lot, laced with irritation.

The boy in the black cap didn't flinch. If his driver hadn’t spotted him in time, the car would have backed right into him.

The vice principal quickly stepped forward. "Mr. Blackwood, this boy just enrolled last week. He... doesn’t interact well with strangers."

Every student at Willowbrook Academy had some form of cognitive difference—children and adults alike.

Dominic’s expression softened slightly. He remembered now. The boy was neurodivergent, like Sophia.

Henry shoved his notebook into his backpack with deliberate slowness. Swinging it over one shoulder, he stood up with an air of defiance.

As he passed Dominic, his foot came down hard on the man’s polished leather shoes.

Dominic’s jaw tightened.

That was intentional.

"I’m so sorry, Mr. Blackwood! He didn’t mean it!" The vice principal dropped to his knees, frantically wiping the scuff mark with a tissue.

Henry turned back just enough to smirk at him.

Dominic studied the boy’s face, but the cap shadowed his features. Still, there was something unsettlingly familiar about him.

That smirk confirmed it—this kid was trouble.

Definitely on purpose.

Fine. Nothing about this place was normal anyway.

He wasn’t about to hold a grudge against a child with special needs.

Clara arrived at Mooncrest Manor just past five, fresh from picking Lily up from preschool.

She’d warned Lily they had a special guest waiting at home.

Lily had nodded solemnly, prepared.

But nothing could have prepared her for the sight of Sophia.

The woman was breathtaking.

Her dress was like something out of a storybook, her hair styled in soft, intricate braids.

And her face—she looked like a princess.

"Hi, Miss!" Lily chirped, skipping toward her.

"Hi, Sis," Sophia whispered shyly.

Something in her posture relaxed at the sight of Lily.

A girl her own age—or so she believed.

She hadn’t spoken a word until now.

Lily clapped both hands over her mouth, eyes wide.

"Lily, remember what I told you? She’s our guest, and she’s unwell. She thinks she’s younger than you," Clara explained gently.

Lily’s eyes sparkled with fascination. "Oh... Can I pretend she’s my little sister? Can we play?"

Clara glanced at Evelyn, who gave a small nod.

With a delighted squeal, Lily grabbed Sophia’s hand and tugged her toward the bedroom.

Clara approached Evelyn, who hadn’t moved from the sofa since arriving home.

"Evelyn, should I go get Henry from school?" Clara prompted.

Evelyn blinked, as if surfacing from deep thought. "No, I’ll go. Is Lily back yet?"

Clara sighed. "She’s in her room. You should stay. You’re distracted, and I don’t trust you behind the wheel right now. There’s food on the table if you’re hungry."

Without waiting for a reply, Clara left.

Evelyn pressed her fingers to her temples, then pushed herself up.

The cold water from the bathroom sink helped, if only a little.

She moved to the children’s room and eased the door open.

"Sis, her eyes move!" Sophia held up a doll, grinning.

"And she talks! Pull her hand—listen!" Lily demonstrated.

Sophia tugged the doll’s arm.

A tinny voice chirped from its speaker.
###Chapter 161

Sophia's face instantly brightened with genuine joy. There wasn't a trace of deception in her expression.

This woman clearly wasn't more intelligent than Lily. Evelyn's resentment toward Sophia began to fade as she observed her.

Dominic loved this woman, yet the longer Evelyn watched her, the stronger her compassion grew.

After dinner, Henry approached his mother.

"Is there something on your mind?" Evelyn asked, gazing at her precious son.

Henry nodded, his large doe eyes filled with concern. "I feel sorry for her," he confessed.

Sorry.

That single word transported Evelyn back to the night she had left Dominic.

That evening had shattered her heart into fragments. She had felt like dying - all because of this woman who now evoked her pity.

She wouldn't burden Henry with those painful memories.

"Yes, she is someone to pity," Evelyn agreed. "But I can't promise I'll treat her condition."

Henry's eyes widened. "Why not?"

"Her illness requires surgery, which carries significant risks. I can't operate without her family's consent," Evelyn explained gently.

Though Henry desperately wanted to help Sophia, he understood his mother's position.

Curious, Evelyn asked, "Do you know her name?"

Henry shook his head and walked over to Sophia. "What's your name?" he inquired.

Sophia paused, deep in thought, before carefully pronouncing, "So-phia. Sophia."

"Sophia! We're sharing a room tonight, right?" Lily exclaimed excitedly, and Sophia nodded with equal enthusiasm.

Meanwhile, Dominic paced anxiously at the police station. His sister had been missing since afternoon.

"Mr. Blackwood, I suspect your sister was taken," the detective concluded. "We've reviewed all surveillance near Willowbrook Academy with no sign of her."

"If she'd left voluntarily, she would have appeared on camera somewhere along the routes."

Dominic's eyes burned with intensity. "I won't let anything happen to her! I must find her!"

"You could offer a substantial reward through missing person posters. With enough money, someone will come forward," the detective suggested.

That would be Dominic's last resort.

By eight o'clock, the city glittered under neon lights and stars.

Dominic left the police station and entered his black Rolls-Royce.

"Destination, sir?" his driver asked.

"Home."

As the engine purred to life, Dominic's phone rang.

He answered.

"Dominic, Evelyn just transferred over a hundred million dollars!" Lucas Grant's voice crackled through the line. "Straight into your account. Damn, that woman's loaded!"

"A hundred million?" Dominic's brow furrowed in confusion. "What's this payment for?"

"The Thornfield Tower sale finalized today!" Lucas abruptly changed subjects. "You don't sound pleased. Something wrong?"

"A hundred million?!" Dominic's veins pulsed visibly. "The agreed price was forty million!"

"Market value is eighty. Evelyn insisted on overpaying you," Lucas teased. "Who knew your pretty face could earn such a premium?"

Dominic ended the call. He scrolled to Evelyn's contact, his finger hovering over the dial button.

This woman never failed to infuriate him - then and now.

Evelyn stared at her ringing phone, Dominic's name flashing on the screen. Her pulse quickened, warmth spreading through her fingers gripping the device.

"Dominic must be frantic about Sophia," Evelyn realized. "Should I tell him she's safe with me?"

###Chapter 162

"Evelyn Thorne! What kind of game are you playing?" Dominic Blackwood's voice was ice-cold.

Evelyn froze. What did he mean by game?

Then it clicked. He was talking about Thornfield Tower.

"You're offering it to me for just forty million dors?" she shot back.

"I don’t need your pity!"

Dominic’s expression darkened, his brows knitting together in frustration.

It was clear now—their relationship was beyond repair.

Dominic had bought the tower intending to gift it to Evelyn back when they were inseparable.

He never planned to profit from Thornfield Industries.

Forty million dors was practically a steal. There was no reason to spoil her with gifts anymore.

And Evelyn would never accept one from him now.

"Fine. We’ll go by market price then," Dominic said, his throat tight. "You don’t need my sympathy, and I don’t need your charity!"

"Good! Transfer the difference back to me—now!" Evelyn gripped her phone so hard her knuckles turned white.

Dominic exhaled sharply. He had nothing left to say and ended the call.

Within minutes, twenty million dors appeared in Evelyn’s account.

Staring at the numbers on her screen, tears pricked her eyes. The clean break she thought they had was now a mess.

He was a rose with thorns—but so was she.

She had considered telling Dominic about Sophia. But this call proved exactly how little he trusted her.

Fine. Good luck finding Sophia on your own.

Evelyn collapsed onto the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.

She felt trapped—and it was all Henry’s fault. He just had to bring that woman home.

She thought she was finally free after the divorce, yet Sophia was now sleeping soundly in her daughter’s bed.

It was like she kept sinking deeper into the same quicksand.

Even if she sent Sophia back now, Dominic would probably accuse her of kidnapping.

Evelyn buried herself under the sheets, drowning in frustration.

A moment later, her phone rang, yanking her back to reality.

With a sigh, she grabbed it.

"Evelyn, I saw that woman Dominic was with!" Sophie Mercer’s voice was a mix of shock and fury. "Dominic Blackwood is heartless! How could he do this to you?"

"We finalized the divorce today." Evelyn rubbed her temples, exhaustion creeping in. "How did you even hear about this?"

"His company posted a missing person notice. They’re offering one hundred twenty million dors for any leads on a woman named Sophia."

Sophie was practically hyperventilating. "And if someone finds her? Two hundred forty million dors. The internet is losing it over this!"

She barely paused for breath. "Evelyn, no wonder you fell for him. I asked Adrian, and he’s never even heard of this Sophia person."

Evelyn’s heart was numb.

She felt nothing.

"Sophie, I’m furious," her friend ranted. "Two hundred forty million just to find her? She must mean everything to him."

Evelyn exhaled. "What time is it?"

"Almost midnight. That’s your response?" Sophie huffed.

Evelyn forced a weak laugh. "What else do you want me to say? We’re already divorced."

###Chapter 163

"That's absolutely right! What was I thinking? Best choice you've ever made, ditching that guy!" Sophie let out an exaggerated sigh of relief. "So what's your schedule looking like tomorrow? Dinner's on me. We're celebrating your newfound freedom!"

"My schedule? Jam-packed. I own Thornfield Tower now," Evelyn replied with a tired smirk.

"Oh, I know all about it from Adrian. Cost you a fortune, didn't it? My ridiculously wealthy best friend."

"Eighty million dors, actually," Evelyn corrected, her voice steady. "He returned the extra twenty million this evening."

Sophie snorted. "Honestly, what is this back-and-forth between you two? It's like watching children bicker over toys."

"I'm just drawing a line in the sand," Evelyn said firmly.

"And I fully support it. That man is ruthless. I told Adrian to steer clear of him!" Sophie's tone dripped with bitterness.

"It's late. I should get some rest—I can barely keep my eyes open." Exhaustion weighed heavily on Evelyn, her eyelids like lead.

Dominic had made his devotion to Sophia painfully clear. To the world, it was a grand, romantic gesture.

Good. This was the closure she needed.

Meanwhile, in a lavish penthouse across town, Bianca stared at the news broadcast about the million-dor reward. To her, it looked like Dominic had completely lost his mind.

"Sophia... who?" she muttered under her breath.

Where had this woman come from?

Bianca had managed Dominic's affairs for years. Never once had she heard of a Sophia.

Then she noticed the details—the short, boyish haircut, the frilly pink dress in the missing person's poster.

A memory flashed—Evelyn's cruel prank.

At the time, she couldn't fathom why Dominic had been so furious.

Now, staring at Sophia's photo, it clicked.

No one else had that haircut. No one else could be Sophia.

Tears spilled silently as Bianca drained her wine glass.

Drunk and desperate, she dialed her brother Tristan overseas.

"Tristan... you won't believe this... Dominic's been obsessed with someone else this whole time..." Her voice cracked.

"He's offering millions for Sophia! Have you ever heard of her?"

"No," Tristan replied sharply. "Bianca, I warned you not to go back there. What good has it done you?"

"Oh, Tristan, I feel like such a fool. Even more pathetic than Evelyn." Her sobs dissolved into hysterical laughter.

"Guess what? Evelyn bought Thornfield Tower for a hundred million dors. A hundred million! I could never pull that off. That woman's loaded beyond belief."

Four years ago, Bianca wouldn't have given Evelyn a second glance. Just some nobody clinging to Dominic's coattails.

Now? The name Evelyn Thorne made her stomach twist with envy.

Tristan whistled. "Since when did Evelyn Thorne have that kind of money?"

"Exactly. I'm the one falling behind. Dominic will never want me. Even without Sophia... Evelyn's younger, more successful... I'm a joke..."

"Bianca, snap out of it!"

Tristan's voice softened. "Dominic isn't who you think he is. He's greedy, selfish. He juggles you, Evelyn, and still pines for someone else."

"And let's not forget the rumors about his father's death. That's not just greed—that's dangerous. Stop wasting your life on him!"

Bianca tugged at her hair, whispering, "Fine... Tristan... I know what I have to do now."

At three in the morning, Lily jolted awake. Sophia was burning up.

She fumbled for the lamp, heart pounding.

Sophia's skin was flushed, her breathing shallow. Half-conscious, she whimpered, "Big Brother... hug me... please..."

In her feverish dreams, she was calling for Dominic.
###Chapter 164

Lily bolted upright in bed, her tiny voice piercing the silence of the night. "Mommy!"

Evelyn Thorne burst into her daughter’s room, clutching a medical kit, her hair wild from sleep. "Go to your brother’s room, Lily," she instructed, her voice tight with urgency.

Her fingers brushed Sophia’s forehead—burning. The fever was worse than she’d thought.

Lily nodded, her big eyes shimmering with worry. "Mommy, did Sophia catch a cold? Should I turn off the aircon?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Fevers can happen for all sorts of reasons. I don’t think it’s from the cold." The room temperature was fine—no way this was just a chill.

She ushered Lily toward Henry’s room before rushing back to Sophia.

The thermometer beeped—103 degrees.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. She had to bring the fever down. Fast.

She prepped a saline drip, then grabbed a basin of warm water from the bathroom, pressing cool cloths against Sophia’s flushed skin.

Three in the morning, and here she was—tending to the sister of the man who’d shattered her heart.

When she finally sat back, exhaustion weighed on her like lead.

Why was fate so cruel? How was she supposed to return Sophia to Dominic now?

She’d never wanted to hurt him.

Her head throbbed.

Meanwhile, in Henry’s room, Lily crawled into bed beside him, jostling him awake.

The moment Evelyn left, Henry turned to his sister. "What’s wrong?"

"Sophia’s sick," Lily whispered. "She kept calling for you in her sleep. I didn’t want to wake you, so I let her be." Her voice wobbled.

"Mom’s with her. She’ll be okay," Henry reassured her. Then, with a sigh, he added, "But if I went missing, Mom would lose her mind. You and Grandma too."

A thought struck him. "Mom had a husband."

Lily gasped. "What? Who? Julian Whitmore?"

Henry scoffed. "No. Mom’s husband was that scumbag dad’s uncle."

Lily shot up, yanking Henry with her. "Tell me everything," she demanded, eyes gleaming in the dim light.

"Dominic Blackwood," Henry said flatly. "Mom just divorced him."

Lily’s face lit up. "Is he hot?"

Henry rolled his eyes. "He’s old."

Lily wrinkled her nose—until Henry added, "But filthy rich."

"Brother, do you have a picture? Please?" she begged.

Henry hesitated. "He’s not Mom’s husband anymore."

Lily pouted. "I can’t sleep until I see him. Just once. Please?"

Grumbling, Henry slid out of bed, booted up his laptop, and pulled up a photo of Dominic.

Lily stared, transfixed. "...He’s gorgeous! Way hotter than that trash dad of ours!"

Henry shut the laptop with a snap. "Still a scumbag. Otherwise, why would Mom divorce him?"

Lily groaned. "We’re cursed, brother! First a deadbeat dad, now a trash ex-stepdad? The Whitmores are evil!"

Henry grabbed her hand, dragging her back under the covers. "Go to sleep."

By five a.m., Evelyn was still slumped beside Sophia’s bed.

Two IV bags later, the fever had broken.

Evelyn staggered to her room, collapsing onto the bed.

At seven, Lily and Henry tiptoed in to check on Sophia—now peacefully asleep.

###Chapter 165

Lily and Henry found Sophia in a restless state. She was murmuring incoherently under her breath.

"Brother... please..."

The twins exchanged worried glances and rushed to her side immediately.

Sophia's cheeks burned crimson, her skin radiating intense heat. "She's burning up! I'll get Mom!" Lily cried, darting out of the room.

Henry gripped Sophia's trembling hands, his small fingers barely able to contain hers. "Sophia, stay with me!" he urged, his voice cracking with concern.

At the sound of his voice, Sophia's eyelids fluttered open slightly.

In her feverish delirium, she mistook Henry for Dominic.

The scorching heat inside her felt unbearable.

"Brother... hold me..." Sophia sobbed pitifully. Henry's heart ached, but his tiny frame couldn't possibly embrace her properly.

He could only wait helplessly for his mother's arrival. "Brother... don't you love me anymore? Why won't you hold me?" Sophia wailed, tears streaming down her flushed face.

The resemblance between Henry and Dominic as a child was uncanny - no wonder Sophia had confused them.

Evelyn burst into the room moments later, her medical instincts kicking in immediately.

Her palm pressed against Sophia's forehead confirmed her worst fears. "Her fever's spiked dangerously high," Evelyn said through gritted teeth. "We need immediate hospital care."

Lily's wide eyes filled with tears. "Mommy, is she... is she going to—"

"Shh, sweetheart," Evelyn soothed while administering fever reducers. "We'll get her proper treatment."

Clara arrived just then, having heard the commotion. "Evelyn, should we call an ambulance?" she asked urgently.

Evelyn hesitated, her mind racing through the consequences.

An ambulance meant exposure. Exposure meant Dominic would find Sophia.

And if Dominic took Sophia back to Zoe Montgomery...

Sebastian's warning echoed in her mind - Zoe couldn't cure Sophia.

Would sending Sophia back to that gilded prison really help her?

Could Evelyn stand by and watch this innocent woman suffer?

"Mom... should I help her?" Evelyn's voice broke as she turned to Clara, her fists clenched so tight her nails dug into her palms.

Clara placed a comforting hand on her daughter's shoulder. "You owe them nothing, darling. There's no shame in walking away."

"But I'm not just Dominic Blackwood's ex-wife!" Evelyn cried, her professional ethics warring with personal resentment. "I took an oath as a doctor!"

Taking a shuddering breath, Evelyn wiped her tears and gently lifted Sophia from the bed.

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Group headquarters, whispers spread like wildfire.

"Have you heard about Sophia? What's her connection to Mr. Blackwood?"

"Must be his secret mistress! Can you blame him? That porcelain doll face could tempt any man."

"Absolutely! She's the most exquisite creature I've ever seen. No wonder he's offering millions for information."

The scandalous gossip reached every corner of the corporate empire.

Nathan sipped his espresso thoughtfully. "Our boss never mentioned her before."

Lucas took an angry gulp of his coffee. "I've known him since college, and he never breathed a word! Some best friend he turned out to be. This is downright humiliating."

Nathan attempted damage control. "Lucas, my sources say she disappeared near Willowbrook Academy. Did some digging - it's a special needs institution."

Lucas's expression darkened. "My research says the same. This woman's no ordinary affair. Never pegged Dominic for having... unconventional tastes."

Nathan nearly choked. "Are you implying our CEO is some sort of—"

"Exactly," Lucas cut in with a sardonic smirk. "Why else would he keep it so hush-hush?"

The pieces clicked into place for Nathan.

"Now Evelyn's divorce makes perfect sense," Lucas continued. "She must have discovered his dirty little secret. That's why she left him and those... special friends of his."

###Chapter 166 

Nathan desperately wanted to call Evelyn for confirmation, but fear held him back.

She had divorced their CEO. Would she even answer his call now?

"Lucas, have you contacted Mr. Blackwood yet?" Nathan asked hesitantly.

Lucas let out a bitter sigh. "If that woman Sophia hadn't disappeared, he'd probably keep this secret forever. It's clearly something he wants buried. Do you really think prying will improve his mood?"

Nathan frowned. "Well, Sophia still hasn't been found. I imagine his temper's worse than ever."

Meanwhile, Henry Thorne sat in Willowbrook Academy when the news broke about Dominic's massive reward for information on Sophia's whereabouts. Conflicting emotions churned within him.

"What exactly is Dominic's connection to Sophia?" he muttered to himself.

His fingers flew across the keyboard as he searched for "Sophia" in the browser.

The results yielded nothing substantial.

'Sophia' was just a first name. What was her full identity?

Henry's hacking skills granted him access to Willowbrook's database, but even there, only the single name 'Sophia' appeared.

Did she not have a last name?

Or was this deliberate protection from her powerful family?

Just who were her relatives?

Frustrated by the dead end, Henry redirected his investigation toward Dominic.

After compiling information on the Blackwood family tree, his brow furrowed.

No Sophia existed among the Blackwoods.

Dominic only had one older brother.

This left only one plausible explanation for Dominic's relationship with Sophia.

A romantic entanglement!

If Julian Whitmore was scum, then Dominic was the emperor of all scumbags!

How could he possibly be involved with a psychologically vulnerable woman?

Elsewhere, Bianca had tracked down Zoe Montgomery.

Zoe currently resided in Mooncrest Manor, a lavish estate Dominic had arranged for her, complete with round-the-clock staff and security.

When Bianca arrived, the opulent villa and army of servants twisted a knife in her heart.

"Dr. Montgomery, could we speak privately?" Bianca requested.

Zoe nodded indifferently.

With Sophia missing, Zoe found herself with unexpected free time.

They strolled through the manicured neighborhood, shadowed at a discreet distance by bodyguards.

"Dr. Montgomery, do you know what Sophia means to Dominic?" Bianca's bloodshot eyes betrayed her sleepless night. The questions had tormented her since sobering up.

Zoe shook her head. "Miss Chamberlain, I didn't ask, and he didn't volunteer that information."

"Could you ask him? I've been by his side for years and never heard of this woman. It's... unsettling!" Bianca's voice grew increasingly agitated.

Zoe studied her calmly. "Miss Chamberlain, that's his private affair. I won't pry, and if you're so curious, you should ask him directly."

"I already did! He refused to tell me anything."

"If he won't tell you, why would he tell me? We've only met twice," Zoe replied logically. "Didn't he just finalize his divorce yesterday? At least we know he and Sophia weren't married."

Bianca scoffed, "Obviously they weren't married. Can you imagine him wedding someone... like that? But he spent a billion dollars searching for her! It's incomprehensible."

"If you're jealous, perhaps you should find ways to make him spend on you instead."

Bianca's face contorted. "That's not what I meant! I don't want his money. I just want—" She bit her tongue before admitting she craved Dominic's love.

Zoe interrupted smoothly, "A man's willingness to spend money is the truest measure of his affection."

The words struck Bianca like lightning.

"I've already lost. First to Evelyn, now to some... some mentally challenged woman! What does that say about me?" Bianca whispered bitterly.

"How very noble of you," Zoe remarked dryly.

"Don't mock me! I'm humiliated enough—defeated by Evelyn Thorne, then upstaged by a... And now I'm questioning everything about myself."

Zoe observed Bianca's unraveling with detached interest. Suddenly, Evelyn Thorne seemed far more intriguing than she'd initially assumed.
###Chapter 167

Evelyn Thorne must have been truly remarkable to have remained married to Dominic Blackwood for over four years.

Zoe Montgomery had heard whispers about her while studying abroad.

Evelyn had also been a student of Professor Sebastian Whitmore, publishing several groundbreaking papers.

Yet, after graduation, Evelyn seemed to vanish from the medical world.

She never joined any prestigious hospitals or entered the industry.

How far could theoretical knowledge take her without hands-on experience?

Otherwise, why would Dominic entrust her with Sophia’s treatment?

As evening fell, Clara Thorne glanced at the two children before her. "Why aren’t you two eating?"

Lily Thorne puffed her cheeks. "When is Mommy coming back?"

Clara sighed. "She’ll return once she finishes her work. I can’t say exactly when."

Lily’s voice trembled. "Is she helping Sophia?"

"Yes, sweetheart. Don’t worry, Sophia will be fine."

Beside her, Henry Thorne scowled. "Sophia… bad woman!"

Clara’s brows furrowed. "What do you mean? You were the one who brought her home. Why say that now?"

His tiny fists clenched. "She’s with Dominic!"

Clara hadn’t expected him to know.

"Henry, these are grown-up matters. You don’t need to worry. Sophia isn’t as clever as you or Lily. What could she possibly do wrong? And even if she did, it’s Dominic’s fault." Clara couldn’t bring herself to blame Sophia.

To her, Sophia was still a child in mind.

Henry’s guilt deepened.

If he had known about Dominic’s past with his mother and his twisted connection to Sophia, he would never have brought her home.

Mom must be heartbroken.

When she returned, he would apologize.

At eight sharp, Dominic’s phone rang.

"Mr. Blackwood, we’ve located the hacker!" The voice on the other end was frantic. "The digital trail leads to your nephew, Julian Whitmore!"

Dominic froze.

Since when was Julian a hacker?

"Sir, we triple-checked the data. The IP address traces back to the Blackwood family’s old estate."

Dominic’s knuckles whitened, his eyes darkening with lethal intent.

The Rolls-Royce shot out of the driveway like an arrow.

Ten minutes later, it screeched to a halt outside the ancestral home.

Dominic stormed inside, his voice thunderous. "Where is Julian Whitmore?!"

Gregory and Beatrice Blackwood rushed to their son’s side.

Julian, hearing the commotion, bolted from his room.

"Uncle, you were looking for me?" His voice was weary. Forced into a divorce, he’d spent days drowning in video games.

A sickening crack echoed through the hall.

Dominic’s fist connected with Julian’s jaw, sending his phone clattering to the floor.

"You attacked Willowbrook Academy? How dare you!" Dominic’s roar shook the walls. "Hand Sophia over! If she’s harmed, I’ll make sure you rot in an unmarked grave!"

Julian staggered back, stunned.

"Dominic, have you lost your mind? Julian’s useless—he can’t even code!" Gregory grabbed Dominic’s arm, panic flaring.

Dominic ordered Julian’s devices seized for forensic analysis.

Two hours later, the verdict was in.

"Uncle, I swear, my phone was hacked! It’s always with me… except two days ago, when a little girl borrowed it!" Julian’s voice cracked. "She couldn’t have been older than five. There’s no way she planted malware, right?"

###Chapter 168

"Why did that child ask to use your phone?" Dominic questioned cautiously, his piercing gaze fixed on Julian.

The younger man winced as he touched his bruised face. "She was lost and needed to call her father. Ever since I met her, my life's been nothing but disasters! I swear she put a curse on me!"

Tears streaked down Julian's swollen cheeks, making him look utterly pathetic.

Dominic studied him with thinly veiled disdain. The man was a walking disaster. "Can you describe her?" His voice was clipped, lips pressed into a hard line.

"Of course! She was stunning—that's the only reason I handed over my phone!" Julian sniffled. "She looked exactly like Evelyn!"

At the mention of her name, Dominic's shoulders tensed almost imperceptibly. "Go clean yourself up."

"But Uncle—" Julian winced again. "My phone's been hacked! It sent all my private photos to my blind date and ruined everything! I think it's still compromised!"

He had no idea why he'd been targeted.

Who could possibly hold such a grudge against him?

"Julian, go to your room and let your mother tend to those bruises. I need to speak with your uncle alone," Gregory interjected firmly.

With a defeated sigh, Julian shuffled away.

Once they were alone, Gregory's expression darkened. "This hacker is relentless. First, they infiltrated Julian's phone, stole his data, then breached Willowbrook Academy's systems. This is a coordinated attack. But why kidnap Sophia? It's been twenty-four hours without a single ransom demand."

Dominic's jaw tightened.

Money wasn't the issue—he'd pay any sum.

His only fear was what they might do to her.

"Dominic, do you have any enemies?" Gregory pressed.

"It has to be someone from the academy," Dominic muttered. "A month ago, I had someone audit their personnel files."

Gregory exhaled sharply. "Your security is airtight. Even Mother and I haven't been able to see Sophia in years. For an outsider to get close..." He trailed off, then added bitterly, "If she hadn't wandered off, this never would've happened."

"Don't blame her." Dominic's knuckles whitened. "She was scared. She ran."

"I'm not blaming her. She's just a child." Gregory's eyes glistened. "I just pray she's still alive."

Morning light filtered through the curtains, but Evelyn still hadn't returned.

Lily's eyes were puffy from crying. "Grandma, I don't want to go to school today," she whispered, clutching her stuffed bunny. "I want Mommy."

Clara, equally strained, relented. "Alright, sweetheart. We'll wait until she comes home, okay?"

Henry, ever observant, leaned close to his sister. "Want to see Mom?" he murmured.

Lily's face lit up instantly.

"Grandma, we're going to play outside for a bit," Henry announced, already leading Lily toward the door.

Clara sighed. "Henry, shouldn't you be in school? Never mind—just be careful."

The siblings slipped into a waiting taxi.

Henry gave the driver an address.

"Is Mommy there?" Lily asked in a hushed voice.

Henry nodded.

Evelyn staggered out of the operating theater at St. Elizabeth Medical Center, her vision blurring from exhaustion.

"Mommy!"

Small arms suddenly wrapped around her legs.

Henry stood beside her, his tiny fingers gripping the edge of her coat.

Evelyn blinked in disbelief. "What are you two doing here? Who told you I was here? Where's Grandma?"

Her weariness evaporated at the sight of them.
###Chapter 169

Evelyn cradled Lily in her arms as the little girl pointed a chubby finger at her brother. "Henry brought me here."

"Oh... Henry, how did you know where I was?" Evelyn's lips curved into a soft smile, though exhaustion weighed heavily on her. She didn't scold him. "Did you ask Uncle Lucas to track my phone?"

Henry nodded.

Uncle Lucas had been the one to teach him how to hack.

Evelyn had no idea just how skilled he'd become.

"Let's go home," she murmured, her thoughts sluggish. "I'm so tired."

She stepped out of the hospital with both children in tow and hailed a cab. The moment she slid into the backseat, sleep claimed her.

At 11:20 a.m., Zoe Montgomery received a call from an unknown number. The voice on the other end instructed her to go to St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

When she arrived, she found Sophia.

The young woman lay motionless, her head wrapped in bandages, her face alarmingly pale.

Two hours later, Dominic Blackwood's phone rang.

"Mr. Blackwood, I found Sophia! She's at the hospital—I just performed brain surgery on her!" Zoe's voice trembled with excitement.

In those two hours, she had scanned Sophia's brain and discovered evidence of an incredibly precise operation.

When she questioned the nurses, none could name the surgeon.

Seizing the opportunity, Zoe commandeered the operating theater, pretending to be busy.

Once enough time had passed, she called Dominic and claimed full credit.

After all, if the real surgeon hadn't left a name, who could prove her wrong?

Dominic rushed to St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

The moment he saw Sophia, the frantic pounding of his heart eased.

"Dr. Montgomery, what happened?" He gripped Zoe's arm, his voice rough with emotion.

She placed a reassuring hand over his. "Sophia had collapsed. A Good Samaritan brought her in. I happened to know one of the directors here, and when he heard I was back in Eldermere working for you, he contacted me immediately."

Dominic didn't question her story, though something still nagged at him.

"Why did you operate on her so quickly?"

"Her condition was critical. A single second of delay could have been fatal. I had to act fast—that's why I didn't call you sooner." The lie slipped out smoothly, though guilt prickled beneath her skin.

"Thank you." His eyes glistened.

Finding Sophia alive—and stable—was nothing short of a miracle.

The past two days had been hell.

But now, she was safe.

"Mr. Blackwood, should we transfer her to a better facility? The conditions here aren't ideal for recovery," Zoe suggested.

Dominic nodded. "I'll arrange it now."

A satisfied smile touched her lips.

"Dr. Montgomery, I can't thank you enough." His gratitude was genuine. "Did you see the person who brought her in? I’d like to thank them personally."

"By the time I arrived, they were already gone. If they wanted recognition, they would have stayed."

Dominic exhaled. "You're right."

One hundred and fifty-five million.

Who in their right mind would walk away from that kind of reward?

He needed to find this mystery person.

After transferring Sophia to a private hospital, Dominic called his team. "Pull the surveillance footage from St. Elizabeth’s main entrance. I want every frame from this morning."

###Chapter 170

Dominic received a response to his inquiry within twenty minutes.

"Mr. Blackwood, I just contacted St. Elizabeth Medical Center. They informed me that their surveillance system was undergoing maintenance that day, so no footage is available."

His subordinate’s answer made Dominic’s brow furrow.

Was this truly a coincidence?

Or was someone deliberately preventing outsiders from accessing the recordings?

"Scrub all traces of this incident from the internet—every news article, every photo," Dominic commanded, his voice sharp.

"Understood, Mr. Blackwood. I’ll handle it immediately."

An hour later, every mention of Dominic’s search for Sophia—including the staggering $155 million reward—had vanished. Even the photos of her had been wiped clean.

Evelyn slept like the dead.

If not for her phone ringing incessantly, she wouldn’t have stirred at all.

Sophie had already called multiple times before Evelyn finally dragged herself to answer, letting it ring for a full minute before picking up.

"Hello…" Her voice was thick with sleep, followed by a yawn.

"Evelyn! Don’t tell me you’re still asleep! It’s only seven! Are you napping or officially calling it a night?!" Sophie’s voice was shrill enough to jolt Evelyn slightly more awake.

Rubbing her bleary eyes, Evelyn glanced out the window.

The sky was still bright, though dusk was creeping in.

"Sophie, is this important? If not, I’m going back to sleep. I’m exhausted," Evelyn mumbled, hugging her pillow tighter.

"Did you pull an all-nighter? Are you moonlighting as a burglar now? We agreed to celebrate your divorce today! I already booked the restaurant. If you don’t show up, I’ll have everything packed and delivered to your place—so send me your address!" Sophie, ever the force of nature, left no room for argument.

"No… Just send me the restaurant’s address. I’ll get dressed and meet you there."

With great effort, Evelyn pushed herself out of bed.

"Weren’t you just complaining about being sleepy? Let me just send the food to you! I swiped an excellent bottle of wine from my dad’s collection—I’ll stash it at your place for next time."

In an instant, Evelyn was wide awake.

If Sophie’s boyfriend wasn’t Adrian, she wouldn’t have been so paranoid about her finding out about the twins.

"Sophie! I’m awake now! Where are you? Send me your location—I’ll be there in no time!"

"Fine! I’ll send it! Is your mom with you? Bring her along!"

"She’s already eaten. It’s fine."

Hanging up, Evelyn gathered her tangled hair into a messy ponytail and shuffled to her closet, pulling out a sleek maxi dress.

After changing, she stepped out of her room.

The living room was dark.

They weren’t home.

She pulled out her phone and video-called her mother.

Clara answered immediately. "Evelyn, you’re awake? I left dinner in the kitchen for you."

"Sophie’s taking me out, so I won’t be eating here. Mom, where are you?" Evelyn grabbed her bag and headed for the door.

"We’re at the park! That drone from overseas arrived today. The kids were dying to test it out," Clara said, angling the camera toward the sky.

A vibrant drone, expertly controlled by Henry, darted through the air like a dragonfly.

Around it, other children flew kites, their laughter carrying through the screen.

Evelynted, amused. "Have fun. I’m heading out."

Half an hour later, she arrived at the upscale restaurant Sophie had chosen.

A grand piano stood on a small stage, where a handsome musician played a haunting melody.

"Sophie, you came alone?" Evelyn teased as she slid into the seat across from her. "I thought you’d bring your entourage."

###Chapter 171

"It's our girls' night. Why would I invite him?" Sophie poured a glass of wine and slid it across the table toward Evelyn. "What kept you up last night? Those dark circles could rival a raccoon's."

Evelyn lifted the glass and took a slow sip. "Just binge-watching dramas. Nothing serious."

"Please." Sophie rolled her eyes. "That smile is so forced it looks like it's glued on. Spill it. Still hung up on Dominic, aren't you?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her wine. "Sophie, do I really seem that naive?"

Sophie nodded without hesitation. "You may run a multi-million-dollar company, but when it comes to love? Absolutely."

Meanwhile, at a secluded corner table, Lucas was refilling Dominic’s glass.

This was the only upscale restaurant near St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

"Dom, I won’t pry about you and Sophia. Just wanted to grab a drink with you." Lucas swirled his wine thoughtfully. "By the way, is Dr. Montgomery really as brilliant as they say?"

Dominic took a measured sip. "She performed Sophia’s surgery. Still no change in her condition."

"Hmm… If it works, what’s your reward for her?" Lucas arched a brow, curiosity gleaming in his eyes.

"Whatever she asks."

"And if what she wants… is you?" Lucas smirked. "Evelyn couldn’t handle your heart belonging to Sophia, but some women don’t care. Take Bianca, for example. What if Zoe doesn’t either? What then?"

Dominic shot him a sharp look. "She lives overseas. This was just a temporary visit."

"If you offered her a ring, she’d drop everything in a heartbeat." Lucas chuckled. "Face it—you’re catnip to women."

"Dr. Montgomery isn’t like that," Dominic stated firmly.

Lucas shrugged and let the subject drop.

Then, his gaze snagged on a familiar figure. "Dom, isn’t that Sophie over there? And the woman with her… from the back, she looks just like Evelyn."

Squinting, Lucas stood abruptly and strode toward their table before Dominic could respond.

Dominic’s eyes followed—and instantly locked onto Evelyn.

He’d recognize that silhouette anywhere.

Even after four years, Nathan had said she hadn’t changed much.

"Sophie, where’s Adrian?" Lucas’s question was directed at Sophie, but his attention was fixed on Evelyn. "Wait—is that Miss Thorne?"

Evelyn startled at the sudden interruption.

Lucas eyed the wineglass in her hand and sighed dramatically. "You never drank before. Guess time changes people. Perfect timing—Dom and I are having a drink too. Join us!"

Without waiting for an answer, he dashed back to grab another bottle and two glasses, then dragged Dominic over.

Evelyn sat frozen.

Sophie scowled. "This is a private dinner. Since when did you two get an invitation?"

"Last time we had dinner, you called me ‘brother.’ Forgotten already?" Lucas teased. "And Dom and Evelyn were married once. Divorced or not, they can still be civil, right, Miss Thorne?"

Evelyn rubbed her temple, flustered.

Civil?

Even drunk off her feet, civil was impossible with Dominic.

"Evelyn, I didn’t mean to stand you up earlier." Dominic stood beside her, one hand in his pocket, the other holding his wineglass.

His deep gaze bore into her.

She looked exactly as he remembered—only softer now, more refined.

"No explanations needed. I wasn’t waiting for one." Evelyn met his eyes with a practiced smile. "Actually, I just remembered an urgent matter. Excuse me."

She stood to leave—but Dominic blocked her path like an immovable wall.

###Chapter 172

The wine in her glass was still full, and her bowl was untouched.

If he hadn’t appeared, she wouldn’t have excused herself. "Enjoy your meal. I’ll take my leave."

With that, he turned on his heel and strode away, his long legs carrying him effortlessly through the crowd.

Lucas hurried after him, still clutching the wine bottles. "Dominic! Wait up!"

Sophie flashed Evelyn a grin and raised her glass. "Evelyn, you’re still unmatched."

Evelyn blinked innocently. "He was the one who wanted to leave."

Sophie laughed, clinking her glass against Evelyn’s. "Oh, please. The way he looks at you? That man is still head over heels."

"Sophie, you’ve been watching too many romance dramas. It’s rotting your brain."

"Weren’t you the one binge-watching shows last night?"

"Not romance," Evelyn countered, taking a slow sip of wine. "I have better things to do than obsess over men. My life doesn’t revolve around them."

Sophie nodded. "You’re right. Dominic clearly didn’t prioritize you."

"Enough about him. Let’s eat." Evelyn lowered her voice. "I drove here. I’ll need my driver to take me home."

"There are plenty of drivers outside," Sophie said, pouting. "Evelyn, I still haven’t seen your new place. Why won’t you let me visit? I don’t even know which mansion is yours in Mooncrest Manor."

Evelyn took another sip of wine, her cheeks flushing slightly. "Another time. My place is… a mess right now."

"But doesn’t your mother live with you? How bad could it be?"

"Uh…" Evelyn scrambled for an excuse.

Just then, Dominic received a call and swiftly made his way toward the exit.

Sophie nudged Evelyn. "Look, Dominic’s leaving."

Evelyn turned her head just in time to see his retreating figure.

He was in such a hurry… Had Sophia woken up?

Sophia Blackwood had indeed awakened.

Zoe Montgomery had called Dominic, urging him to return to the hospital immediately.

When Sophia opened her eyes in the ICU, she found herself surrounded by unfamiliar faces in an unfamiliar room.

"Sophia, I’m Dr. Montgomery. I performed your surgery," Zoe said, trying to establish trust.

She had no idea what was going through Sophia’s mind or how the operation had affected her.

Sophia stared at Zoe blankly.

She didn’t recognize this woman.

When Zoe reached for her hand, Sophia instinctively pulled away.

Moments later, Dominic arrived.

The moment Sophia saw her brother, the panic in her eyes eased slightly.

She reached for him weakly.

Dominic immediately took her delicate hand in his, his grip gentle but firm.

Seeing her discomfort, Dominic turned to Zoe. "Dr. Montgomery, she’s uneasy around strangers. Could you give us a moment?"

Zoe nodded and stepped out of the room.

Once the door slid shut, Dominic leaned closer. "Sophia, does your head hurt?"

She nodded weakly. "Big Brother… what happened to me?"

"You had brain surgery. The pain will fade in a few days." His voice was soft, his gaze even softer. "Sophia, do you remember how you left Willowbrook Academy?"

An image of Henry flashed in Sophia’s mind.

"Big Brother… you took me out with you!"

To her, Henry and Dominic were indistinguishable—the same person in her eyes.

Dominic frowned.

Was she still disoriented from the anesthesia?

"Big Brother… who was that woman? I don’t know her," Sophia murmured, her brow furrowing as she recalled Zoe’s face.

"That’s Dr. Montgomery. She’s the one who operated on you."

###Chapter 173

"I don't know her," Sophia muttered, her voice laced with unmistakable disdain as she glared at Zoe. "I've never seen her before… I don’t know her…"

Dominic sighed, his tone patient but firm. "You fainted, Sophia. They brought you to the hospital. That’s why you haven’t met her until now."

"Fainted?" The word echoed in her mind, unfamiliar and unsettling.

Suddenly, Sophia's breath hitched. "No! No!" she cried out, her hands trembling as she clutched the sheets.

The last thing she remembered was Evelyn’s face—soft, warm, and filled with concern.

She had been lying in bed, burning with fever, and Evelyn had been speaking to her in that soothing voice of hers.

The exact words escaped her, slipping through her fingers like sand.

But she could still recall the kindness in Evelyn’s eyes, the gentleness of her touch. It had been the only thing that made her feel safe.

Now, the mere effort of trying to remember sent a sharp pain lancing through her skull. Tears welled in her eyes, spilling over as she gasped, her head throbbing as if it were being split open.

"Sophia, does it hurt?" Dominic’s voice softened as he reached for a tissue, carefully wiping the tears from her cheeks. "Close your eyes. Don’t think about anything. Just sleep. When you wake up, it won’t hurt as much."

His hand settled on her shoulder, warm and reassuring, coaxing her into the quiet embrace of sleep.

She had just undergone brain surgery. Rest was crucial.

Once she finally drifted off, Dominic stepped out of the ward, his expression shifting from concern to relief.

Zoe was waiting just outside, her posture tense. "How is she?"

Dominic’s lips curved into a rare smile, genuine and bright. "She’s speaking more than she ever has before. And she seems… clearer. More aware." His voice carried a note of triumph. "Dr. Montgomery, the surgery was a success."

Zoe exhaled sharply, her shoulders relaxing. "That’s wonderful. I was worried—what if it hadn’t worked? What if it didn’t meet your expectations?"

Dominic didn’t hesitate. Overcome with gratitude, he pulled her into a brief, impulsive hug. "Dr. Montgomery, thank you."

Zoe’s pulse stuttered at the sudden contact. A flicker of guilt twisted in her chest—but beneath it, something warmer, something dangerously close to satisfaction.

She tentatively returned the embrace, her voice carefully measured. "Mr. Blackwood, this is just my job."

Her words snapped him back to reality.

Dominic released her immediately, though his smile remained. "It’s a demanding job, and I appreciate it more than you know. You should go home and rest. We’ll see you tomorrow."

Zoe nodded. "If Sophia needs anything urgent, don’t hesitate to call me. Anytime."

With that, Dominic watched as she walked away, his expression unreadable.

Lucas, standing a short distance away, had seen everything.

Zoe Montgomery.

Even at first glance, he knew she wasn’t as simple as she pretended to be.

He had intended to visit Sophia, but the bodyguard stationed outside the ward blocked his path.

Lucas frowned. "What? You don’t recognize me anymore?"

"Mr. Grant, of course I recognize you," the bodyguard replied, his tone firm. "But I can’t let you in without Mr. Blackwood’s permission."

A dry laugh escaped Lucas. "Even if his mother or brother showed up, you’d stop them too?"

The bodyguard didn’t flinch. "Yes."

Lucas’s amusement faded. "Why? Is she not allowed to see anyone?"

"Strangers frighten her."

Lucas stared, incredulous.

Dominic’s protectiveness was bordering on obsessive.

Keeping her isolated wasn’t helping her—it was making things worse.

"Fine," Lucas muttered. "Just open the door. I’ll stand here and look. I won’t go in."

The bodyguard hesitated. "Mr. Grant, don’t make this difficult for me."

Lucas smirked. "Your boss isn’t here. Let me take a peek, and I’ll owe you a few bottles of the good stuff."

The bodyguard wavered, clearly tempted.

Then, Dominic’s voice cut through the air like a blade.

"Lucas."

Lucas turned, forcing a grin. "Dominic! Dr. Montgomery’s gone already? You said the surgery was a success—Sophia’s doing better? That’s incredible! Can I at least see her?"

"No."

Lucas’s smile vanished. "You can’t keep her locked away forever, Dominic. It’s not healthy. She needs to interact with people."

Dominic’s expression darkened. "Not now."

Lucas scoffed. "Fine. But you need to think about the future. How did you even meet her? Does she have family? Or are you just planning to wait until she’s ‘fixed’ before you marry her?"

Dominic’s jaw clenched. "Ask one more question like that, and we’re done."

###Chapter 174

Lucas grabbed Dominic's arm, pulling him toward the emergency exit.

"Dominic, it's clear you still have feelings for Evelyn. Why do you keep acting this way? This—Sophia. No matter how stunning she is, do you really think she compares to Evelyn?" Lucas wanted to shake some sense into him.

"No one means more to me than Sophia!" Dominic snapped, his voice sharp.

"Did Evelyn divorce you because of this?" Lucas pressed.

"Yes!"

"Then she isn’t the one at fault! What right do you have to be upset? You’re the one who let her down!" Lucas rarely spoke to him with such intensity. "As your friend, I won’t judge who you choose to love. I just want you to—"

"Then like Evelyn, you should leave too!" Dominic cut him off. "I don’t need outsiders interfering in my personal life!"

He used the word outsiders.

Lucas exhaled heavily.

Fine.

If Dominic wanted to be this stubborn, he’d regret it sooner or later.

Evelyn was single now, but that didn’t mean she’d stay that way forever.

Hopefully, Dominic could keep living without regrets when she married someone else.

When Evelyn returned home, it was already past ten.

She quietly opened the door to the children’s room, and Lily immediately lifted her head. "Sweetheart, why aren’t you asleep yet?" Evelyn walked over and gently stroked her daughter’s hair.

"Mom! Henry and I were playing with drones today! It was so much fun!" Lily chirped excitedly. "Uncle Mike sent them."

"I saw them. But it’s late, darling. Time for bed."

Lily pouted adorably. "I was waiting for you to come home and kiss me goodnight."

Evelyn leaned down and pressed a kiss to her daughter’s cheek. "Goodnight, my love."

"Mom, you’ve been drinking!" Lily’s small hand brushed against her mother’s face.

Evelyn sighed, pulling back. "I’m sorry, baby. I forgot. Let me get a towel to wipe it off."

Lily giggled. "It’s okay! You still smell nice!"

Warmth flooded Evelyn’s heart.

She hurried to the bathroom, dampened a towel, and gently cleaned her daughter’s cheek.

Once Lily was asleep, she slipped out of the room.

Back in her bedroom, she called Mike.

"Finally! I’ve been waiting for your call. What took you so long?" Mike’s voice was playful but impatient.

"I had a lot to handle today. Just got home." Evelyn switched to speakerphone and tossed her phone onto the bed as she grabbed her pajamas. "Are those drones you sent over part of your new prototype?"

"Absolutely! They’re incredible! The battery life is insane, and the sensors? Next-level. Honestly, they’re practically robots!" Mike’s excitement was palpable. "Once they hit the market in Eldermere, they’ll dominate!"

Evelyn frowned slightly. "The team at my company isn’t fully set up yet. I’ll get it done as soon as I can."

"I know you’ve been busy with the divorce lately."

"It’s done. Also—have you been teaching Henry how to hack? I’ve seen him on my computer during his free time. Don’t fill his head with anything dangerous."

"He’s interested! And I didn’t charge you for lessons, so don’t complain."

"Let’s drop it. I’m exhausted." Evelyn ended the call and headed to the bathroom with her pajamas.

At one in the morning, Dominic was still at the hospital.

He’d finally gotten his hands on yesterday’s surveillance footage.

Maintenance had just been an excuse to deny him access.

He scrolled through the footage, determined to find out who had brought Sophia to the hospital.

Even if they refused the reward, he wanted to know their name.

If they ever needed help, he’d be there.

By three, his eyes burned with fatigue.

His coffee cup sat empty.

Only an hour of footage remained.

He’d rest after finishing it.

Rubbing his temples, he refocused on the screen—

And froze.

A familiar figure appeared.

Amid the crowd entering and exiting the hospital, he recognized Evelyn instantly.
###Chapter 175

The woman cradled a small child in one arm while guiding another by the hand.

Dominic's breath hitched.

The surveillance footage was grainy, obscuring Evelyn's features.

A gnawing suspicion took root—what if this woman wasn't Evelyn at all?

Why would she have two children with her?

Evelyn had no children.

He replayed the clip three more times.

Each viewing deepened his unease, stripping away any remnants of sleep.

After saving the footage, he snapped the laptop shut.

Jumping to conclusions now would be reckless.

When dawn broke, he'd confront Evelyn directly.

At six sharp, Sophia stirred awake.

She slid off the hospital bed, padding barefoot to the cot where Dominic slept.

Her fingers tugged at his sleeve. "Brother... Brother..."

Dominic's eyes flew open, bloodshot from exhaustion.

"Let's go home," Sophia pleaded, her voice carrying the petulance of a child unwilling to stay another minute in the sterile room.

He rose instantly.

An hour of fitful sleep left him leaden, but Sophia's post-surgery temperament was unpredictable.

Her improved cognition was evident when she didn't fight him about leaving—a small mercy.

Thirty minutes later, Sophia gaped at Mooncrest Manor's wrought-iron gates. "Where are we?"

"My home." Dominic studied her reaction. "Would you like to live here with me?"

Normally, she'd have clung to the familiarity of Willowbrook Academy.

This time, she nodded.

The surgery's success was undeniable. Though her mannerisms remained childlike, her comprehension had clearly progressed beyond that of a toddler.

Watching her, Dominic's thoughts drifted to Zoe Montgomery.

He owed that woman more than gratitude.

Evelyn didn't rouse until ten.

The twins had already left for school.

Clara set a plate of pancakes before her as she entered the kitchen. "Sleep well, darling?"

"Like the dead." Evelyn smiled, reaching for the maple syrup. "I'll be at Thornfield Industries all day. Don't wait dinner."

"Lily and I can collect Henry after ballet." Clara squeezed her shoulder. "Your father would be proud, seeing you revive his company."

Evelyn's throat tightened. "I hope so."

The Thornfield boardroom hummed with tension as Evelyn distributed product manuals.

"My father dreamed of autonomous vehicles," she began, "but I believe some controls should remain human. Therefore, we're pivoting to semi-autonomous systems."

Her phone lit up with a call from Dominic Blackwood.

She excused herself, stepping into the hallway.

His accusation crackled through the receiver: "Why were you at St. Elizabeth Medical Center with two children?"

###Chapter 176

Evelyn felt the air leave her lungs as if invisible hands were tightening around her throat.

Never in her wildest dreams had she imagined her twins would show up at the hospital searching for her.

Worse still, she never expected St. Elizabeth Medical Center to betray her trust by releasing security footage they had promised to keep confidential.

Dominic had always been relentless when it came to uncovering secrets. Evelyn knew he would dig until he found out who brought Sophia to the hospital.

But there was one crucial detail he wouldn’t know—Sophia had been admitted the day before yesterday, not yesterday.

No matter how much footage he reviewed from yesterday, he would never see Evelyn’s face in those halls.

"Dominic, we’re divorced," Evelyn said coldly, forcing her voice steady. "It’s none of your business whether I was at St. Elizabeth yesterday, or how many children I was with."

Her next words came out sharp, laced with old pain. "They aren’t yours. I could never have a child with you. Or have you forgotten? You were the one who ended our baby’s life."

Without waiting for a response, she hung up.

She didn’t want to hear his voice—not his excuses, not his guilt. All she wanted was for Dominic and Sophia to live their lives far away from hers.

She was done with the past.

Dominic clenched his jaw as the line went dead.

The dial tone mocked him, echoing in the silence of the empty mansion.

Evelyn’s words had struck like a blade.

He had forced himself to forget that night—the night he made her go through that procedure. But she never had.

The memory had festered in her heart all these years.

His chest tightened.

Did he regret it?

The answer came instantly, as it always did.

No.

"Mr. Blackwood," Mrs. Wilkins interrupted softly. "Dr. Montgomery is here."

Dominic schooled his expression and strode toward the living room.

Zoe Montgomery stood near the fireplace, bathed in sunlight.

Gone was her usual crisp professionalism. Today, she wore a flowing dress in vibrant hues, her hair loose around her shoulders, her makeup light and effortless.

Dominic paused.

"Don’t tell me you don’t recognize me," Zoe teased, laughing.

"I’ve been under so much stress with Sophia’s surgery. Now that it’s over, I finally feel like myself again."

She glanced around. "I’m actually from Ravenswood originally. My father moved us abroad when I was young, but this city still feels like home."

Dominic nodded. "Do you need someone to show you around?"

Zoe’s eyes brightened. "That would be wonderful."

"I’ll have my driver take you," he said.

Her smile faltered.

Dominic added, "Sophia needs me here."

Zoe recovered quickly. "Of course. It’s a shame she doesn’t warm up to me. Otherwise, I’d love to spend time with her."

"Let’s discuss your payment," Dominic said, steering the conversation back to business.

Zoe flushed. "The deposit you gave me was more than generous. There’s no need—"

"One and a half million," Dominic stated.

He had spent years searching for doctors who could help Sophia. None had succeeded until Zoe.

Money meant nothing compared to that.

And he never liked owing favors.

###Chapter 177

The easiest way to avoid Zoe demanding anything more from him was to pay her a substantial sum. Money solved everything.

Dominic knew that.

Zoe Montgomery’s eyes widened in shock. "Mr. Blackwood, you can’t be serious. Sophia’s condition isn’t something that can be fixed with just one surgery. You know as well as I do that while her cognitive abilities have improved slightly, she’s far from independent. If you want her to continue progressing, there will be more procedures—second, third, maybe even more."

Dominic listened in silence. Zoe was only here on her annual leave. She wouldn’t have this kind of time later.

"Dr. Montgomery," he said after a pause, "what are your long-term career plans?"

There was no question—he wanted Sophia to keep receiving treatment. If her intelligence could reach a level where she could care for herself, that would be ideal.

Zoe understood exactly what he was asking. He wanted her to continue treating Sophia, but she might not stay in Ravenswood indefinitely.

She sighed. "Mr. Blackwood, to be honest, I’m at a crossroads. I’m thirty-four, and my family is pressuring me about marriage. My career isn’t my top priority right now."

When Dominic didn’t respond, she decided to be blunt. "If you want me to keep treating Sophia, there’s a simple solution."

His expression darkened.

"Miss Montgomery," he said after a tense silence, "I can introduce you to someone suitable."

Zoe’s smile faltered, but she forced a laugh. "I didn’t expect that from you."

"Because I need you to continue Sophia’s treatment," Dominic said flatly. "But I will never marry again."

She studied his sharp features, her gaze lingering.

"Mr. Blackwood, marriage isn’t the only option. Let’s be honest—any woman who’s met you would struggle to settle for less. Why don’t we… keep each other company? That way, my family stops nagging, and I can focus entirely on Sophia’s case."

She had found his weakness—Sophia’s condition. If he was willing to spend a fortune on her treatment, was it too much to ask for him to play the role of her lover?

Unless he didn’t care about Sophia’s progress anymore.

She was forcing him to choose.

Meanwhile, at Thornfield Industries, Evelyn Thorne had just wrapped up her morning meeting when her assistant stepped in.

"President Thorne, Vincent Holloway from Aureate Tech is here to see you. He used to be our VP," the assistant informed her.

Evelyn’s lips thinned. She hadn’t forgotten how Vincent had called to gloat when Thornfield Industries collapsed.

She strode into the conference room.

Vincent stood, flashing a charming smile. "Evelyn, it’s been too long. You look even more stunning than I remember."

She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, unimpressed. "What do you want?"

He chuckled. "Your offer to rehire former employees at double their old salaries has made waves. I was wondering if there’s room for me too?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "No."

His smile vanished. He hadn’t expected such a blunt refusal.

"Just a joke," he backtracked, forcing a laugh. "I’m doing fine at Aureate Tech."

"Then why are you here?" she pressed.

Vincent hesitated. "Just… visiting."

Her lips curled. "Is Thornfield Industries a zoo? Or a café?"

Fuming, he stormed out.

Evelyn returned to her office, unfazed. Just as she reached for her water, her phone rang.

She set the glass down and answered.

"Evelyn!" Sophie Mercer’s furious voice crackled through the line. "Dominic is dating that doctor! What the hell? I thought Sophia was the only woman he cared about!"
###Chapter 178

Evelyn pressed her fingertips against her temples. She had believed divorcing him would make her immune to his affairs. So why did this still sting? If Dominic cared so deeply about Sophia, why couldn't he just devote himself entirely to her?

The answer came swiftly. It wasn't about which woman he chose. She simply couldn't accept that she'd fallen for such a despicable man. Admitting that meant questioning her own judgment in men.

"Evelyn, are you okay?" Sophie's voice held concern. "Maybe I shouldn't have told you. But you'd have found out eventually."

"I'm fine," Evelyn replied, reaching for her water ss. The cool glass grounded her. "It's his life. As long as he's happy."

"Adrian mentioned it was Zoe's condition. Her treatment worked well. Dominic offered payment, but she refused money," Sophie explained.

Evelyn's stomach twisted. "No need to justify his choices. No one forced him."

"Apparently Sophia needs ongoing treatment. Zoe's the only one who can help, so..." Sophie trailed off, realizing how much she sounded like she was defending him.

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "How convenient. If Zoe doesn't mind sharing him with half the city, it's a perfect arrangement."

Sophie nodded vigorously. "She's moved into Mooncrest Manor already. Bizarre, but whatever makes them happy. Forget that bastard. He's dead to us now."

"Agreed. Work's crazy this week. Dinner when things calm down?" Evelyn offered.

"Deal!" Sophie brightened.

After hanging up, Evelyn stared into her water ss. She knew little about Zoe Montgomery, but this stunt revealed her audacity. The woman hadn't even performed Sophia's surgery, yet dared blackmail Dominic into a relationship. Wasn't she afraid of exposure?

Not that Evelyn cared. Zoe wanted Dominic; Evelyn wanted nothing from him - not his wealth, not his body. Just peace with her children. She wouldn't waste energy exposing Zoe's lies.

Night had fallen when Evelyn returned home exhausted. The living room TV glowed in the dark.

"Mama!" Lily came running. "You're home! Are you tired?"

Evelyn shook her head, smoothing her daughter's hair. "Not at all, sweetheart. How was school?"

"If mama's not tired, then Lily's not tired," the four-year-old declared, her cherubic face serious.

She tugged Evelyn toward the sofa where financial news played. Dominic's striking features filled the screen.

"Lily, did you turn this on?" Evelyn frowned at the unusual channel choice.

Lily glanced at Henry. "Henry did... I changed it..."

Evelyn's arms encircled her daughter as she called, "Henry, come here. Both of you need to hear this."

The boy abandoned his puzzle and approached. Evelyn pointed at the screen. "Memorize this face. If you ever see him, walk away immediately. Don't go near him."

Lily's nose scrunched. "Why, mama?"

Evelyn chose her words carefully. "He might hurt you if he finds out about you both."

She repeated Dominic's own threat verbatim - how he'd sworn to strangle any children she bore. Now that he knew of their existence, caution was essential.

Lily's tiny hands grabbed the remote and silenced the TV. Any admiration for the handsome man vanished. In her child's mind, he'd transformed into a monster.
###Chapter 179

"Dinner's ready. Go wash your hands," Clara called out as she stepped out of the kitchen.

Evelyn immediately ushered Henry and Lily to the sink to clean their hands.

By 9:00 p.m., the children were in their room. Henry lay wide awake, his mind racing over what Evelyn had mentioned before dinner.

"Lily," Henry whispered to his sister.

"Henry, you're still awake too? I'm scared. Dominic is so handsome, but he's a bad man. Sob, sob, sob. Why does he want to hurt us?" Lily stretched out her arms, hoping her brother would hold her so she could feel safe.

Henry shared his suspicion. "Maybe he's our father."

"What?" Lily gasped, her eyes widening.

"Lily, we need to take control. We have to find out the truth ourselves." Henry's voice was firm, a plan already forming in his mind.

"What should we do, Henry?" Lily asked, her big round eyes fixed on him.

"Go to sleep first," Henry said simply.

The next morning, chaos erupted at Blackwood Group. The entire corporate network crashed, sending the IT security team into a frenzy as they scrambled to identify the breach.

Dominic rushed to the office the moment he heard. How could a corporation of this scale suffer such a catastrophic system failure? Nothing like this had ever happened before.

Upon arrival, he first inspected the IT department before returning to his office and powering on his computer—only to find it had been hacked as well.

Every employee’s screen displayed a neon-green background with a mocking tongue-out emoji.

But Dominic’s screen was different.

Bold, crimson letters flashed against the same garish green: *"Come and strangle me, you sshole!"

Dominic’s jaw tightened. Asshole? The word was juvenile, almost laughable. What kind of adult would taunt him like this?

An hour later, the rest of the company’s systems were restored—except Dominic’s. His computer remained locked, the virus far more sophisticated than the others.

The IT team crowded into his office, desperately trying to crack the encryption.

Nathan frowned. "Mr. Blackwood, your nephew Julian was hacked before. Could it be the same person?"

Dominic’s expression darkened. "Last time, the hacker used Julian’s personal data. We never uncovered their identity."

"This hacker is circling us," Nathan analyzed. "First Julian’s phone, then the security footage from Willowbrook Academy, and now our entire corporate network. What’s their endgame?"

Dominic didn’t know. When Sophia had gone missing, she hadn’t been harmed. So the hacker wasn’t after her.

That left only two targets: Julian or himself.

Then, an image flashed in Dominic’s mind—Henry.

The boy had just transferred into Willowbrook Academy. The principal claimed he didn’t speak to strangers, yet the teacher had mentioned some kind of agreement between them—an unspoken truce that allowed Henry to stay.

That boy was anything but innocent.

Dominic made a mental note to dig deeper into Henry’s background as soon as he left the office.
###Chapter 180

Dominic had arrived at the administrative office of Willowbrook Academy. His fingers trembled slightly as he flipped through the file he'd requested.

Name: Henry Thorne

Mother: Evelyn Thorne

Age: Four years and four months

The moment Dominic saw Evelyn's name, his breath hitched.

The boy who'd stepped on his polished shoes was Evelyn's son. And the child was already four years old.

Four years. Exactly how long it had been since Evelyn disappeared from his life. If Henry was hers, that meant she'd been carrying his child when she left.

A cold sweat broke across Dominic's forehead as the realization struck him.

"Is there a problem with this student, Mr. Blackwood?" The administrator fidgeted nervously, observing Dominic's sudden pallor.

Dominic's throat tightened. "Take me to him."

"I'm afraid Henry isn't in school today," the administrator stammered. "Shall I call his mother for you?"

"That won't be necessary."

Clutching the file, Dominic stormed out. He needed answers—and he would get them directly from Evelyn herself.

Meanwhile, in the rose garden of Mooncrest Manor, Bianca Chamberlain's manicured nails dug into her palms. She'd never anticipated that Zoe Montgomery would prove to be such a viper.

This wasn't how things were supposed to go. Bianca had introduced Zoe to Dominic hoping to regain his favor. Instead, the neurosurgeon had slithered her way into Dominic's bed.

Bianca had gravely underestimated her opponent.

"Tell me, Doctor Montgomery," Bianca forced a smile, though her voice quivered with suppressed rage, "are you really willing to throw away your prestigious career for this?"

Zoe examined her perfect manicure. "Jobs are replaceable. Opportunities like this aren't."

The blatant dismissal made Bianca's vision swim with red spots. If not for Dominic's protection, she'd have already slapped that smug face.

"So you're determined to steal him from me." Bianca's words came out through clenched teeth.

Zoe finally met her gaze. "Miss Chamberlain, must every woman mourn the man you can't have?" A cruel smile played on her lips. "Here's some free advice—either improve your worth or accept reality. Dominic Blackwood doesn't settle for mediocre women."

Bianca's ears rang as if struck. Mediorce? Her? The heiress to Veritas Capital? The insult burned worse than acid.

"Careful, Doctor," Bianca hissed, stepping closer. "Even peacocks can be plucked bare."

Zoe simply glanced over Bianca's shoulder at the two hulking bodyguards shadowing her every move.

"Shall we test that theory?" Zoe's voice dripped honeyed venom. "One scream and they'll break your pretty fingers before you can touch me. Or should I call Dominic right now?" She tilted her head. "Are you certain you want to play this game, Bianca?"

Zoe had no desire for enemies. But she'd learned long ago—sometimes you had to bare your fangs to keep what was yours.
###Chapter 181

The priority was clear—Sophia needed to be cured. Only then could Evelyn remain by Dominic's side for the long term.

Bianca's rage burned so fiercely that crimson veins spiderwebbed across her eyes, especially when Zoe dared to call Dominic her boyfriend. But what could Bianca do? In the end, she had no choice but to storm out.

Evelyn watched Bianca's retreating figure with a cold smirk. "Pathetic. She folded without me even lifting a finger."

Meanwhile, at Thornfield Industries, Evelyn was knee-deep in recruitment. Though most former employees had returned, the company's new direction demanded fresh expertise.

Mike was due to arrive today to assist. His presence would finally give Evelyn a moment to breathe.

"President Thorne, should we consider hiring a celebrity ambassador?" the marketing manager suggested during their strategy meeting.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. "No."

"But influencer collaborations are the current trend—"

"We rely on the product alone," Evelyn cut in firmly.

The manager blinked. "So... no marketing at all?"

"That’s not what I said. Promotion is necessary—just not through celebrities or influencers."

"Then how?"

Evelyn set down her documents. "We bring in industry experts. If the product is flawless, the sales will follow."

The theory was sound, but with no tangible product yet, the manager couldn’t shake his unease.

"President Thorne... are you truly confident in this?"

A faint smile curled Evelyn’s lips. "I can’t explain it yet. You’ll understand when you see it for yourself."

A knock interrupted them.

"Come in."

The door swung open, revealing a strikingly handsome young man in avant-garde fashion.

The manager frowned. "Who are you? This is Thornfield Industries—"

Mike breezed past him and pulled Evelyn into an exuberant hug.

"Missed you like crazy, and it’s only been days!" he declared, grinning.

The manager stiffened, then hastily excused himself. Clearly, this was Evelyn’s... companion. Overseas living must’ve changed her tastes.

Outside, Evelyn’s secretary approached, poised to knock.

"Don’t!" The manager intercepted her. "President Thorne’s boyfriend is in there. Let’s... give them space."

The secretary bit her lip. "But Dominic Blackwood from Blackwood Group is here to see her. I can’t leave him waiting downstairs!"

The manager paled. After a steadying breath, he said, "I’ll handle it."

He marched to the elevator—just as the doors slid open.

Dominic stepped out, his presence icy and imposing. The manager’s breath hitched.

"President Blackwood! Let me escort you to President Thorne’s office." He scurried ahead, back slightly hunched in deference.

At the door, his courage faltered. Offending either of them was unthinkable.

"Here we are," he mumbled.

Dominic didn’t hesitate. He pushed the door open—and froze.

Evelyn sat in her chair, while Mike perched on her desk, idly twirling a lock of her hair. Their laughter was intimate, their closeness undeniable.

A deafening bang echoed as Dominic kicked the door wide open.

###Chapter 182

The sudden crash of the door slamming open made Evelyn and Mike jump in their seats. Their heads snapped toward the entrance, where Dominic stood like a storm cloud, his expression dark and foreboding.

"Hey there, Evelyn's ex!" Mike hopped off the desk with a grin, completely oblivious to the danger radiating from the man in the doorway.

Evelyn's pulse spiked. Mike had no idea who he was dealing with—Dominic Blackwood wasn't just intimidating; he was downright terrifying when provoked. She lunged forward, grabbing Mike's arm and yanking him back before he could take another step.

Dominic's jaw tightened. His fingers curled into fists, crumpling the paper in his grip. He took a deliberate step forward, closing the distance between them until Evelyn could feel the heat of his anger.

Her instincts screamed at her to get Mike out of there. Now.

"Wait outside," she ordered, shoving Mike toward the door before slamming it shut behind him.

The moment they were alone, Dominic's voice cut through the silence like a blade. "Who the hell is that?"

Evelyn squared her shoulders. Without an audience, she refused to cower.

"Dominic, don't push me. I don't want to argue with you." She snatched the paper from his hand, her breath hitching when she saw the name printed there.

Henry Thorne.

Her stomach twisted. Fear clawed up her throat, but she forced herself to stay composed.

Dominic's icy gaze bore into her. "Evelyn Thorne. Is this child mine?"

The accusation hung in the air, sharp and unrelenting.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "No. Our child was gone a long time ago. Henry is adopted. I took him in while I was overseas."

It was a lie. It had to be. If Dominic ever found out the truth, he'd tear her world apart. He despised children—had sworn never to have any. And Henry… Henry wasn't like other kids. She couldn't risk what Dominic might do if he got his hands on him.

"Adopted?" Dominic's brow furrowed. "Why would you adopt a child?"

"Because he needed someone," she snapped. "And this is the last time I'm explaining myself to you. Stay out of my life. If you're so bored, go entertain your girlfriend."

She tossed the paper into the shredder, watching it disappear in jagged strips.

Dominic's anger flickered, replaced by something colder. "Evelyn, your new boyfriend is a joke. You could do better."

The words stung, but she refused to let him see it.

"Funny, I was thinking the same about your girlfriend. Should've stuck with Bianca. At least she had class."

Dominic's jaw clenched. "You've never even met Zoe. She's ten times the woman Bianca ever was."

Evelyn arched a brow. "And what do you know about Mike? He might look like a mess, but he's got a heart of gold. Unlike some people who juggle three relationships at once."

Dominic's face went pale. Without another word, he turned on his heel and stormed out, leaving Evelyn standing there, her hands trembling.

###Chapter 183

After Dominic stormed out of the office, Lucas stepped back inside.

His concerned gaze swept over Evelyn. "What did your ex-husband want? He looked like he was about to tear the place apart. Did he hurt you?" Lucas guided her gently to her chair and handed her a glass of water.

Evelyn's pulse still raced with anger, but Lucas's kindness soothed her frayed nerves. "He thought you were my boyfriend," she admitted with a tired sigh. "I didn't correct him. Will that cause problems for you?"

Lucas's lips curved into a playful smirk. "Just your boyfriend?" He leaned in slightly, mischief dancing in his eyes. "If you'd like, I could be your husband. We could get married right now."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "I have no plans to marry again. Save that space for your true love."

His expression dimmed. "Neither do I. My ex shattered my heart too thoroughly. I don’t think true love exists for me."

Years ago, Lucas had suffered from a brain tumor. Evelyn had been the surgeon who saved his life. But during his illness, his partner of five years had abandoned him. After his recovery, they founded Apex Innovations together.

"Enough dwelling on the past," Evelyn said, shaking off the melancholy. "Have you found a place to stay? I can book you a hotel if needed." She pulled out her phone, ready to search.

Lucas grinned. "I'm staying with you. I already dropped my bags at your place. Your mother was lovely, by the way." He winked. "Think about our partnership. Your home is my home. Why waste money on a hotel?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to argue but stopped. Arguing with Lucas was pointless—especially since he was gay.

Meanwhile, Henry skipped school today. He and Lily had a mission: uncover the truth about their real father. Since Dominic was nearly impossible to approach, they decided to start with Julian.

During lunch, Julian stepped out of his office, heading to a nearby café.

Lily appeared in front of the building, her backpack slung over one shoulder.

Julian recognized her instantly—those doll-like curls were unforgettable. She’d haunted his nightmares ever since she’d hacked his phone with a Trojan virus.

Every time he woke, he dismissed the idea. How could a child barely old enough to tie her shoes master such advanced tech?

"Hey, kiddo!" Julian crouched to her level, gripping her small arm. "What are you doing here? Looking for me?"

Lily blinked up at him with wide, innocent eyes. "Yes, Uncle! I’ve been searching everywhere for you!"

"Why?" Julian frowned. "Last time, you borrowed my phone to call your dad, but I never saw the number you dialed." He guided her toward the café, shielding her from the blistering sun.

Lily’s voice was sweet and precise. "Because I forgot his number. But I found him later, and Daddy wanted me to thank you. He even sent a gift!"

Julian chuckled. How could he ever suspect this angelic face? Her father must be a refined gentleman.

"Did your dad bring you here?" he asked.

Lily nodded. "Daddy works nearby. He had to go back to his office."

Before Julian could ask more, Lily pulled out a small electronic toy and set it on the ground.

"Uncle, can you turn it on?" she asked sweetly.

As Julian bent down to find the switch, Lily moved swiftly—plucking a few strands of his hair between her tiny fingers.
###Chapter 184

"Uncle, stay still!" Lily shrieked, her small fingers tangled in Julian's hair.

Julian had been about to stand, ready to demand what she was doing, but the urgency in her voice froze him in place.

"You have so many gray hairs!" she declared, her tone a mix of horror and exaggerated concern. "People will think you're ancient!"

Seizing the moment, she swiftly plucked a few strands and tucked them into a small plastic bag, stashing it in her backpack before Julian could react.

"There!" she announced, patting his shoulder with satisfaction. "All gone!"

Julian rose, rubbing his tender scalp. "Let me see. I don’t remember having gray hair."

Lily blinked innocently, gesturing vaguely toward the air. "I already threw them away. Why would you want to see? It’s just boring old gray hair."

Julian stared at her, speechless.

She wrinkled her nose, adding insult to injury. "Your hair is super greasy, too. I need to wash my hands now, or they’ll smell gross."

With that, she scampered off, leaving Julian standing there, bewildered. He ran his fingers through his hair—dry and soft, not oily at all. And gray hairs? He was certain he didn’t have any.

What a strange child.

The same thought had crossed his mind the first time he met her. Was this another scheme? Suspicion prickling, he pulled out his phone, scanning for any signs of tampering.

Meanwhile, Lily dashed to her brother, triumphantly presenting the stolen strands.

"Did I do good?" she asked, beaming.

Henry nodded, pleased. "Ice cream for you."

"Yay! But… will Mommy be mad I skipped school today?"

Skipping kindergarten to hang out with Henry was way more fun, but Lily still worried about her mother’s reaction.

Henry’s expression remained unreadable. "No."

Their mother always knew when they skipped, yet she never scolded them. In Henry’s opinion, kindergarten was beneath him—too simple, too childish.

"Okay! Let’s go! I want chocolate!" Lily cheered, clinging to her brother’s arm.

Henry carefully stored Julian’s hair in his bag before leading her to the ice cream shop. Fifteen minutes later, they sat side by side, happily licking their cones.

Lily’s smile faded slightly. "What if our dad is Dominic? Mommy said he’d strangle us."

Henry didn’t hesitate. "I won’t let him."

"Would we call him Daddy? You said he’s super rich."

Henry’s answer was firm. "No."

At Dominic’s estate, Sophia was recovering well after her surgery. Aside from occasional headaches and a stubborn refusal to eat, she was quiet, mostly keeping to herself. Mrs. Wilkins tended to her with gentle patience.

It wasn’t until the third day that Sophia began to trust her slightly. Though she still didn’t speak, she accepted the food and water offered without resistance.

Mrs. Wilkins couldn’t help but wonder about the relationship between Dominic and Sophia. In all her years working for him, she’d never seen him so tender, so indulgent—like a parent doting on a child.

It was nothing like how he treated Evelyn or Zoe. With them, he’d been affectionate, yes, but this was different. With Sophia, his care was protective, almost reverent.

Perhaps it was because of her condition, Mrs. Wilkins mused.

"My head… better now," Sophia murmured, her voice soft.

Mrs. Wilkins smiled. "Would you like to go outside?"

Sophia nodded.

###Chapter 185

Mrs. Wilkins wrung her hands anxiously. "Sophia, the doctor insisted you need bed rest for at least two weeks. It's barely been five days since your surgery. If I take you outside, Mr. Blackwood will have my head."

Sophia tilted her head slightly. "Who is Mr. Blackwood?"

"Dominic Blackwood," Mrs. Wilkins answered, then hesitated. "What do you call him?"

Sophia thought for a moment before pointing toward the window. "My sunshine."

Mrs. Wilkins was at a loss. Unable to decide, she quickly called Zoe.

Minutes later, Zoe strode into the room.

"Sophia, you want to go outside?" Zoe asked with a practiced smile. "I can take you, but you'll need to use the wheelchair. I'm worried you might get dizzy if you walk."

Sophia only wanted fresh air—the wheelchair didn't matter. She nodded, and Mrs. Wilkins retrieved the wheelchair Dominic had used previously.

"Mrs. Wilkins, I'll handle this," Zoe said smoothly, taking the handles and guiding Sophia into the front garden.

This was another opportunity to solidify her position as Dominic's girlfriend. Every small interaction with Sophia was a step toward that goal.

Sophia's resistance toward her was fading. Progress. With consistent effort, Zoe was certain their relationship would improve dramatically.

The temperature hovered around 86°F, the air thick even without direct sunlight.

"Sophia, are your headaches still bad? I can prescribe something stronger if you need it," Zoe offered gently.

In her assessment, Sophia now had the cognitive capacity of a ten-year-old. Treating her as such was the best approach.

Sophia shook her head. "No."

She wouldn’t take medication from strangers—especially not Zoe. Only if Dominic handed it to her would she consider it.

Zoe kept her smile intact. "It’s good to hear you speaking. Dominic and I both want you to recover quickly."

Sophia stayed silent. After a few minutes of breathing in the garden air, she suddenly asked, "Did you really do my surgery?"

If Zoe had performed the operation, why couldn’t Sophia remember her face before losing consciousness? The only face that lingered in her mind was Evelyn’s—though she didn’t know her name.

Zoe stiffened. Sophia had been acting like a child—why was she asking this now? Did she remember something?

A flush crept up Zoe’s neck. What would Dominic do if he found out the truth?

"Dr. Montgomery?" Sophia pressed when Zoe didn’t answer.

Zoe inhaled sharply and gambled. "Yes, it was me. Do you remember something? You can tell me."

Sophia pressed her lips together and fell silent.

The next morning, Evelyn’s phone buzzed violently, yanking her from sleep. She squinted at the screen—Sophie Mercer.

"Sophie, it’s seven in the morning. Since when do you wake up before noon?" Evelyn groaned, rubbing her eyes.

After working late, Clara had taken the kids to school, leaving Evelyn to sleep in.

"My parents left for their cruise. I just dropped them at the airport," Sophie replied. "Since Mooncrest Manor was on the way back, I thought I’d stop by. Which villa are you in? I brought breakfast—let me see your new place."

Evelyn shot upright so fast her vision blurred from the sudden blood rush.

"Evelyn! I’m already at the gates. You’re not seriously going to turn me away, are you?" Sophie huffed, hands on hips.

Evelyn bolted from bed. Confirming the kids were at school, she frantically gathered their toys and dumped them in the nursery. Once the living room was presentable, she texted Sophie her address.

Three minutes later, the doorbell chimed. Evelyn emerged from the bathroom, toothbrush in hand, just as Mike—wearing only pajama pants—darted past her to answer the door.

###Chapter 186

The toothbrush slipped from Evelyn's fingers, clattering onto the bathroom tiles. Sophie gasped so hard she nearly dropped the breakfast bag in her hands.

Fortunately, Mike moved like lightning, catching the bag mid-air before it hit the ground.

"Evelyn, is this your friend?" Mike asked, ruffling his sleep-mussed hair.

Without waiting for an answer, he dug into the bag, pulling out a pancake and taking a large bite. He offered another to Evelyn with a grin. "Not bad. Want some?"

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she took in Sophie's stunned expression. She grabbed Mike's arm and shoved him back toward his room.

"Sophie, just—wait here. Sit down," Evelyn managed, her voice tight.

Sophie blinked, then exhaled sharply. Her fingers flew over her phone screen as she fired off a message to Adrian.

Sophie: HOLY CRAP. Evelyn’s got a HOT roommate. Like, model-level hot.

Adrian: Wait, Evelyn? Our Evelyn?

Sophie: If I hadn’t seen it myself, I wouldn’t believe it. She’s living it up! No wonder she’s moved on from Dominic so fast. This guy is unreal—tall, lean, face like a damn sculpture.

Adrian: Pics or it didn’t happen.

Sophie: She shoved him back into his room. I’m interrogating her the second she comes out. Stay tuned.

Adrian: Oh, I’m waiting.

Evelyn snatched her toothbrush off the floor and retreated to the bathroom, splashing cold water on her face. Five minutes later, she finally emerged, bracing herself.

Sophie crossed her arms. "So. Explanation. Now."

Evelyn sighed. "He’s a business partner."

"Oh, so you’re partnering in more ways than one?" Sophie smirked.

Evelyn nearly choked on her water. "Did you see us in bed together?"

"Please. If you weren’t sleeping together, why’s he staying here instead of a hotel?" Sophie shot back.

Evelyn set her glass down with a thud. "I’m single. Even if I was with him, what’s the problem?"

Sophie’s eyes lit up. "No problem at all! If he’s your new man, I’m thrilled for you." She plopped onto the couch beside Evelyn, grinning. "I just didn’t realize you moved on this fast. Dominic’s going to lose his mind."

Evelyn’s lips twitched. "He already did. Two days ago."

Sophie gasped. "Wait—he knows? How did he react?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Like an adult. Mostly."

The second Sophie left Mooncrest Manor, she called Adrian, demanding he relay the news to Dominic.

Adrian, ever the instigator, dialed Dominic immediately.

"Dominic. Sophie just saw Evelyn," he said, embellishing freely. "Apparently, there’s a guy living with her. And Sophie says he’s ridiculously good-looking."

Dominic’s grip tightened on his phone. He remembered the man from Evelyn’s office—had they really gotten that close?

"She can live with whoever she wants," Dominic snapped. "Don’t waste my time with this." He hung up.

Adrian huffed, then turned to Lucas. Since their argument, Dominic and Lucas hadn’t spoken. But now, Lucas looked almost… amused.

Was Evelyn doing this to mess with Dominic? If so, brilliant. If not? Even better. Watching Dominic unravel was entertaining.

——

Meanwhile, at Willowbrook Academy.

Henry had the DNA results in his hands. The report confirmed one thing: Julian wasn’t his father.

But the data showed something else—a genetic link between Henry, Lily, and Julian. Which meant only one thing: Dominic was their biological father.

When Henry thought Julian was his dad, he’d been disappointed. Now? Now he had a much bigger problem.
###Chapter 187

Teaching Henry a lesson was easy. But going after Dominic? That was another story entirely.

Ever since Henry had successfully hacked into Blackwood Group's cybersecurity system, Dominic had invested heavily in upgrading their firewall. Now, Henry couldn’t even get past the first layer of defense.

Uncle Vincent had been swamped with Thornfield Industries’ affairs and couldn’t spare time to help. Frustrated, Henry could only glare at Dominic’s photo on his screen, silently seething.

The classroom was empty except for Henry. Two teachers were assigned to supervise him—one for general care, the other for instruction. The instructor droned on at the front while Henry, headphones on, tapped away at his laptop. The scene was oddly peaceful.

Then, a shadow flickered outside the door. Henry caught the movement but pretended not to notice.

Knock. Knock.

It was Sophia. The teacher brightened at the sight of her.

"Sophia! What brings you here? Are you alone?"

Sophia had been restless at home since her headaches subsided. She insisted on returning to school, so the chauffeur dropped her off with her nanny in tow.

She had wandered the campus all morning, searching for something—or someone. Now, she stood frozen outside Henry’s classroom, pointing straight at him.

The teacher turned to Henry. "Henry, Sophia is looking for you. Do you know her?"

Henry didn’t even glance up. "No."

Sophia’s face crumpled. Her lips trembled before she blurted, "Yes!"

The teacher blinked. Since when did these two, who rarely spoke to anyone, suddenly have a conversation?

Henry snapped back, "No!"

Sophia stomped her foot. "Yes!"

After several rounds, Henry’s ears ached. He shoved his chair back and marched over to her.

They moved to a secluded corner like old conspirators.

"You’re a bad woman!" Henry hissed. "I’m not helping you anymore!"

Sophia’s eyes welled up. "Why? I’m not bad! I’m not!"

"Bad people never admit they’re bad," Henry scoffed. "Stop bothering me. I’m done talking to you!"

He spun on his heel and stormed off.

Sophia’s tears spilled over. The nanny rushed forward, dabbing at her cheeks with a tissue. "Don’t cry, Miss Sophia. What happened? How do you even know that boy?"

The question shattered Sophia’s composure. Sobs wracked her small frame as the nanny guided her away, already dialing Dominic.

"That boy is Henry Thorne. Miss Sophia searched the whole school for him. They argued—he claims he doesn’t know her, but she insists he does." The nanny sighed. "Master Dominic, you should come. She won’t stop crying."

Henry Thorne. Evelyn’s adopted son. Why would Sophia cry over him? When had they even met?

And did Evelyn know?

Dominic’s grip tightened around his phone, knuckles bleaching white.

###Chapter 188

Dominic arrived at Willowbrook Academy with urgency in his steps. The moment he saw Sophia's puffy red eyes, his heart clenched. Without hesitation, he pulled her into his arms, his large hand gently patting her trembling back.

"Shh, little one. No more tears," Dominic murmured, his deep voice laced with soothing warmth.

Sophia's head throbbed from crying so hard. But the moment she heard Dominic's voice, the storm inside her began to settle. She leaned heavily against his chest, exhaustion finally overtaking her. Within minutes, she was asleep.

Carefully, Dominic lifted her and carried her to the small bed in the school's infirmary. He tucked her in, brushing a stray curl from her forehead before stepping out. His expression darkened as he strode toward Henry's classroom.

The teachers took one look at Dominic's stormy gaze and quickly excused themselves, leaving only him and the stubborn little boy inside.

Dominic approached Henry's desk, his presence commanding. Henry barely glanced up, methodically packing his books into his backpack as if Dominic didn't exist.

"Henry Thorne," Dominic said, dragging a chair directly in front of the boy, blocking his exit. "I know exactly who your mother is."

Henry's fingers stilled for just a second before resuming. His small face remained impassive, but Dominic didn't miss the tension in his tiny shoulders.

Dominic leaned forward, studying the boy's half-hidden features beneath that ever-present cap. "How long have you known Sophia?"

Silence.

Dominic's patience frayed. "Answer me, and I'll leave you alone. Refuse, and we'll sit here all day."

Henry exhaled sharply, then dropped his head onto the desk, closing his eyes.

Dominic clenched his jaw. He couldn't exactly manhandle a four-year-old—especially not Evelyn's son.

Minutes ticked by in suffocating silence.

Then, without warning, Dominic scooped Henry up.

Henry's eyes flew open, his small body stiffening. "Put me down!" he snapped, his voice sharp with outrage.

Dominic smirked. So the boy could speak.

"Tell me," Dominic demanded, tightening his hold as Henry squirmed. "What happened between you and Sophia?"

Henry glared, his cheeks flushed with anger. Why was this man interrogating him? Why not just ask Sophia?

Typical Dominic—always assuming the worst of others. No wonder Evelyn left him.

Fury burned in Henry's chest. Without thinking, he leaned forward and bit Dominic's neck—hard.

Dominic hissed but didn't let go.

Game on.

###Chapter 189

Henry didn't stop biting until the metallic tang of blood filled his mouth.

It was four in the afternoon when Evelyn received the call from Willowbrook Academy. Henry had bitten someone, and they demanded her immediate presence.

Evelyn frowned. Henry was the only student in his class. Who could he have bitten? The teacher? The thought made her stomach twist. She slammed her laptop shut, grabbed her keys, and stormed out of her office.

Since when did Henry become violent?

He had always been gentle, well-mannered. But lately, she had been drowning in work, barely spending time with him or Lily. Tonight, she would fix that.

When she arrived at the school, the teacher met her with an apologetic smile. "Miss Thorne, your son has already been taken."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

"Don't worry—Mr. Blackwood took him. You know him, right? I can give you his address—"

Evelyn's cheeks burned with fury. "He just took my son? Without my permission? What kind of school allows this?"

The teacher stammered, "Miss Thorne, please understand—Mr. Blackwood only left minutes ago. I was about to call you, but I knew you were working. He took Henry because he had a fight with Sophia. When Mr. Blackwood arrived, Henry refused to explain. Sophia woke up and wanted to go home, so he took them both. He just wants to understand what happened."

Evelyn barely listened. She clenched her keys until her knuckles turned white.

The teacher hurried after her. "Let me come with you—you don’t know his address—"

"Stop following me!" Evelyn snapped.

"But—"

"I said stop!"

Her heart pounded as she threw herself into the car. What was Dominic doing with her son? Was Henry scared? Hurt? The engine roared to life as she sped off.

Behind her, the teacher muttered, "Does she even know where she's going?"

Dominic had barely stepped into Mooncrest Manor when Mrs. Wilkins rushed forward with a tray of snacks.

Her gaze flickered to the small boy in the baseball cap, his tiny hands gripping his backpack straps like a lifeline. "Master Dominic, who is this?"

"Evelyn's son," Dominic said coolly, sinking into the couch. "Adopted."

Henry stiffened.

Adopted?

Since when? Then he remembered—Mummy had lied. She said if Dominic ever found out the truth, he’d hurt them both.

Mrs. Wilkins softened. "Miss Thorne has such a kind heart." She offered Henry a peeled banana.

He turned away sharply.

Undeterred, Mrs. Wilkins set it aside and fetched a warm towel. Without warning, she tugged off his cap. "Let’s clean that sweaty face—"

The moment the cap came off, Dominic finally saw him clearly.

And froze.

The resemblance was uncanny.
###Chapter 190

"Don't touch me!" Henry's sharp voice cut through the air like a knife.

He swiftly pulled his cap back over his head, hiding his features once more.

Mrs. Wilkins recoiled in surprise at the boy's sudden outburst.

Dominic and Sophia both stared - Sophia with frightened eyes, Dominic with stunned realization. For the first time, he'd seen Henry's face clearly... and the resemblance was uncanny.

"Then wipe it yourself?" Mrs. Wilkins offered after wringing out the towel, her voice gentle but firm. "Your face is sweaty. You'll feel better after cleaning up."

Henry snatched the towel only to hurl it back into the water bucket.

Recognizing the boy's volatile mood, Mrs. Wilkins wisely retreated with the bucket.

"If you don't explain how you know Sophia and what your argument was about, you're not leaving this house tonight," Dominic threatened, having regained his composure.

Henry ignored him completely, making for the door.

Two broad-shouldered guards materialized in the doorway, blocking his path. Henry lifted his chin, fixing them with an icy glare.

The men shifted uncomfortably under the child's piercing gaze. There was something unnerving about the intensity in those young eyes.

This was no ordinary boy. The guards instinctively recognized danger in Henry's predatory stance. He carried himself with the same commanding presence as Dominic himself, putting them on edge.

Henry checked his watch - 4:50 p.m. Grandma would alert Mother if he wasn't picked up from Willowbrook Academy by 5:30. Evelyn would come. He just needed to wait.

Seeing Henry plant himself by the door, Dominic knew he'd lost this battle. There were lines even he wouldn't cross. Harming this boy was unthinkable - Evelyn would never forgive him.

"Sophia," Dominic turned to his sister, "how do you know Henry?"

Sophia nibbled on the banana Mrs. Wilkins had originally peeled for Henry. At the question, her eyes darted nervously between the two males in the room.

Memories surfaced of her begging Henry to take her away from school that day. Telling Dominic would make him angry... but worse, it might make Henry stop speaking to her forever.

So she took another slow bite, blinking up at Dominic with deliberately wide, innocent eyes. The message was clear: she wouldn't betray Henry's confidence.

A strange sense of defeat settled over Dominic. The parallels between Sophia and Henry were striking - both reticent, both wary of outsiders.

His mind raced with unanswered questions about their connection and what had transpired between them.

"Master Blackwood!" Mrs. Wilkins gasped, noticing the bite mark on his neck. "Should I fetch the medical kit?"

Dominic's gaze flicked to Henry. "No need."

Evelyn would be arriving soon, furious no doubt. He'd keep this bite as evidence of her son's misbehavior.

The sound of a car pulling into the driveway sent Henry springing to his feet. Through the window, he saw his mother's familiar figure stepping out of the vehicle.

###Chapter 191

The clock barely struck five in the morning. Dominic never expected Evelyn to arrive this quickly!

Though she often joked that Henry was adopted, the fierce protectiveness in her eyes told another story.

"Henry!" Evelyn's breath caught at the sight of her son perched on the windowsill, flanked by two hulking bodyguards. Tears blurred her vision.

At the sound of her voice, Dominic rose from the sofa and strode toward the entrance.

The guards didn't dare intercept Evelyn.

They'd seen firsthand how deeply Dominic still cared for this woman.

Ex-wife or not, she occupied a space no other woman could touch.

Dominic watched as Evelyn clutched Henry to her chest, her eyes blazing like a storm. She looked ready to wage war.

"Evelyn. We need to talk."

"Talk?" Her laugh was sharp as shattered glass. "You kidnap my son in the dead of night and now you want to talk? Since when do you need my permission for anything, Dominic?"

His jaw tightened. "I didn't harm him. I just needed to know—when did he meet Sophia? What happened between them?"

"Ask Sophia yourself!" Evelyn shot back. "I know she's your weakness, but that doesn't give you the right to terrorize my child!"

A dull throb pulsed behind Dominic's temples. He had no defense—he'd crossed a line.

"Terrorize?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I gave him food. A warm place to sit. Is that your definition of cruelty?"

Evelyn's gaze snagged on the angry bite mark marring his neck. Fresh blood had crusted over the wound.

Henry did that?

Her certainty wavered.

Mrs. Wilkins emerged, her calming presence slicing through the tension. "Ms. Thorne, Mr. Blackwood meant no harm. The boy refused everything I offered."

Evelyn exhaled. Of all people, she trusted Mrs. Wilkins.

Four years apart hadn't dulled the housekeeper's kindness.

"Arguments solve nothing," Mrs. Wilkins chided, guiding Evelyn inside with a firm hand. "Come. Sit."

Every step through the foyer felt like walking through a ghost story. The house hadn't changed. Neither had the ache in her chest.

Dominic's voice cut through her thoughts. "This conversation is overdue."

Evelyn glanced at Henry, then froze.

Sophia stood by the staircase, watching her with unsettling directness.

Their eyes met. Evelyn quickly looked away.

As Dominic led her into the study, Sophia and Henry crept toward the closed door, pressing their ears against the wood.

Mrs. Wilkins shook her head but let them be.

Inside the study, Dominic broke the silence first. "Before Sophia disappeared, she had no friends. Which means she met your son during those missing years."

Evelyn's face gave nothing away. "Ask them, then. I know nothing about it."

Dominic studied her stony expression. "Your son never mentioned her?"

"Henry barely speaks at all." She crossed her arms. "Stop interrogating me. If you're so curious, ask Sophia yourself. Are we done here?"

His next words stopped her mid-turn.

"I hear you're living with that doctor now." Dominic's tone turned razor-sharp. "Tell me, Evelyn—were you already his before our divorce?"

###Chapter 192

Evelyn's brows knitted together as she heard his words.

"That dude? He has a name, Dominic." Her voice carried sharp disapproval. "Could you at least pretend to be civil?"

Dominic's lips curled into a sneer. "Civil? You're lecturing me about civility? You were seeing that man before our divorce was finalized. Where was your respect then?"

"Let's get one thing straight," Evelyn countered, crossing her arms. "I filed for divorce four years ago. You're the one who refused to sign!"

"Until those papers were signed, we were still married!" Dominic's voice rose dangerously. "How dare you betray me like that?"

For a moment, Evelyn almost believed his ridiculous accusation. Almost.

"When did I ever admit to being with him before the divorce?" She threw her hands up in frustration. "These are all your paranoid delusions! If you want to imagine yourself as some wronged husband, don't drag me into your fantasies!"

Dominic inhaled deeply, visibly struggling to regain control. "Fine. What's his name then?"

Evelyn's guard went up immediately. "Why do you care?"

"You're the one demanding I show respect," he pointed out mockingly. "How can I address him properly if I don't know his name?"

"Please," Evelyn scoffed. "Even if I told you, you'd never show him an ounce of respect." She had no intention of giving Dominic ammunition to investigate Vincent. "You've moved on with Zoe. I've moved on too. Let's just leave each other alone."

Just then, Dominic's phone buzzed loudly.

He pulled it from his pocket, glancing at the screen.

Zoe Montgomery's name flashed across the display.

Today was her birthday. She'd invited him to dinner yesterday - her first celebration since returning to Ravenshore. He'd agreed then.

Now she was calling to ask when he'd arrive at the restaurant.

Dominic hesitated, thumb hovering over the screen.

Evelyn caught sight of the caller ID and turned to leave.

His hand shot out, fingers wrapping around her wrist. "We're not done here."

Even divorced, he couldn't stand by while she threw herself at some shady character who looked straight out of a crime syndicate.

Accepting the call, he spoke curtly, "Doctor Montgomery, something's come up..."

"It's alright," Zoe's cheerful voice replied. "I can wait. It's still early."

"I won't be making it tonight." His tone left no room for argument.

The silence stretched before Zoe asked quietly, "Dominic... may I ask why?"

His eyes locked onto Evelyn as he answered, "Sophia isn't feeling well. I need to stay with her."

"I could join you both?" Zoe offered hesitantly.

"That won't be necessary." His reply was final. "She needs privacy."

Ending the call, he tossed the phone onto the nearby table with unnecessary force.

Evelyn couldn't help the bitter laugh that escaped.

How telling. His new girlfriend clearly wasn't that important to him. Just another pawn in his endless game to protect Sophia.

Pathetic. And tragic.

"Karma has a way of catching up, Dominic," she warned softly.

"She knew what she was signing up for," he dismissed easily, steering the conversation back. "Now explain to me why you'd lower your standards for some thug. Was this just to get under my skin?"

Evelyn could only stare in disbelief.

Outside the study...

Sophia nearly knocked before stopping herself.

"I didn't hear anything... nothing at all," she murmured, worrying her lower lip.

Henry remained silent beside her.

Either the room was soundproofed or there truly hadn't been any argument.

Retreating to the living room, Sophia suddenly grabbed Henry's sleeve.

"I'm sorry!" The words burst from her, her grip tightening on her skirt. Gathering courage, she met his eyes. "Henry... I'm truly sorry."

###Chapter 193 

Could it be because she asked him to sneak her out of school, and he got in trouble for it?

That was the only explanation she could come up with.

When Dominic heard her apology, his fury only intensified!

Was she confessing to her inappropriate relationship with him? Was she admitting she caused his parents' divorce?

"Get away from me!" Henry shouted, his voice cracking with emotion. "I never want to see you again!"

Sophia froze in her tracks, tears welling up in her large eyes.

Mrs. Wilkins rushed to comfort the distraught girl. "Sweetheart, don't cry," she murmured, guiding Sophia to the plush sofa. "If he doesn't appreciate your friendship, you shouldn't chase after him."

The housekeeper worried Henry's harsh words would only hurt the sensitive girl more.

But Sophia refused to give up so easily. She shook her head violently, dark curls flying.

"Shh, darling," Mrs. Wilkins gently stilled the girl's movements. "You'll hurt yourself. Stay here while I talk to Henry, okay?"

Sophia nodded eagerly, her tear-streaked face hopeful.

Mrs. Wilkins selected two premium chocolates from the silver tray and approached the brooding boy.

"Henry," she began softly, "I was quite close with your mother years ago." She extended the treats with a kind smile.

Henry hesitated, remembering how calmly Evelyn had greeted this woman earlier. He pocketed the chocolates without refusing.

"Why do you dislike sweet Sophia?" Mrs. Wilkins probed gently.

"I don't need a reason!" Henry snapped, storming toward the grand foyer.

Mrs. Wilkins let him go.

She understood Henry's prejudice stemmed from Sophia's cognitive challenges. While her heart ached for the girl, she couldn't fault the boy entirely.

Henry shared Dominic's striking features but none of his blood. Perhaps their resemblance was mere coincidence?

Returning to Sophia, Mrs. Wilkins dabbed the girl's cheeks with a monogrammed handkerchief. "There is a way to make everyone love you, dear."

Sophia's tearful eyes widened with curiosity.

"Focus on your studies and treatments," the housekeeper advised. "When you're better, everyone will adore you."

Sophia beamed, clinging to this promise.

Meanwhile, in the study, Evelyn had finally ended the debate about her supposed lover by declaring that Dominic's disdain only made her favor Lucas more.

A classic reverse psychology play.

Evelyn had mastered the art of verbal sparring with Dominic. Recognizing defeat, he dropped the subject.

She rose to leave, but he produced another damning piece of evidence - a surveillance photo from St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

It showed Evelyn leaving with two children after Sophia's surgery.

"The girl you're holding," Dominic's gaze burned into her, "you adopted her?"

Evelyn tossed the photo aside carelessly. "Both of them, actually. Why the sudden interest? Looking to adopt? Oh wait - you despise children."

Dominic's jaw tightened. "You barely have time to breathe. Why take on two children?"

"Because I wanted to," Evelyn countered with a defiant smirk. "Got a problem with that?"

Dominic had no retort.

Glancing at her watch, Evelyn realized it was nearly six. Time to collect Henry.

She swept out of the study and froze in the grand hallway.

A striking woman in a lavender gown stood in the foyer, her long hair cascading down her back. Zoe Montgomery - Dominic's newest conquest?
###Chapter 194

"You must be Evelyn." Zoe stepped forward with a practiced smile, extending her hand. "Pleasure to meet you. I'm Zoe Montgomery."

Evelyn gave her a cursory glance, barely masking her disinterest. "Yeah. I was just leaving."

With that, Evelyn and Henry turned toward the exit.

Zoe watched their retreating figures, her gaze lingering longer than necessary.

Evelyn was far more striking than she'd anticipated—youthful radiance with an effortless elegance that made Zoe's fingers curl into her palms.

Why had she come to see Dominic today? And that boy... could he be Dominic's son?

Was this some pathetic attempt to rekindle their relationship using the child as leverage?

The thought left a bitter taste in Zoe's mouth.

Would Dominic actually consider taking her back because of this?

"Dominic, I apologize for dropping by unannounced." Zoe gestured to the ornate cake box on the marble counter. "A friend gifted this for my birthday, but it's too much for one person. I thought you might enjoy some."

Dominic's eyes flickered to the dessert. "Happy birthday. Did you receive the package I sent?"

Zoe's perfectly manicured fingers stilled. "There was a delivery this afternoon... I hadn't realized it was from you. I haven't opened it yet."

A curt nod. "I don't eat sweets. Neither does Sophia." He turned toward his sister, guiding her toward the staircase. "Mrs. Wilkins might join you."

As their footsteps faded, Zoe carefully unpacked the cake, her movements deliberate.

"Mrs. Wilkins," she began, slicing a generous portion, "how long was Evelyn here?"

The housekeeper accepted the plate. "Not long. She came to collect her son."

"Oh?" Zoe's knife hovered over the cake. "That boy was hers? He seemed... rather mature for his age."

"Adopted," Mrs. Wilkins clarified.

Zoe's shoulders relaxed imperceptibly. "I'd assumed he might be... theirs."

"They did have a child together." The housekeeper spoke as if discussing the weather. "Had they not terminated the pregnancy, that child would be about Henry's age now." She saw no harm in the revelation—it was ancient history. "I suspect Evelyn adopted to fill that void."

Zoe's fork tinked against her plate. "Why did they...?"

"Mr. Blackwood didn't want children." Mrs. Wilkins lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Miss Montgomery, if I may advise—if you wish to remain in his life, never mention starting a family. Even if you conceived, he'd demand termination."

Zoe's nod was almost eager. "Thank you for the warning."

———

The car ride home was thick with unspoken questions.

"Did Dominic mistreat you?" Evelyn's grip tightened on the steering wheel.

Henry didn't look up from his sketchpad. "No."

"Was he... cruel?"

"No."

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "Henry, perhaps we should consider transferring schools."

"Unnecessary."

"You enjoy Willowbrook that much?"

A shrug. "It's tolerable."

Truthfully, he preferred the solitude. No pesky classmates, no forced socialization. Teachers treated him like a prodigy, granting unprecedented freedom—more than even his mother allowed.

Evelyn chewed her lip. "What if Dominic takes you again? Next time—"

"He's my father." Henry interrupted, folding a precisely creased paper crane.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "What makes you say that?"

"We share facial structure." His clinical tone contrasted with the childish origami.

Evelyn's laugh bordered on hysterical. "Is it really that obvious?"

###Chapter 195

"Lily looks just like you," Henry remarked.

"Henry, he is indeed your father. But he's not fond of children, so it's best if neither of you approach him. If he discovers you're his, I don't know what he might do," Evelyn warned.

Henry scoffed. "We don’t want a father like him anyway."

Evelyn studied him carefully. "You’ve changed since coming home, Henry. You’ve matured."

"Mom, I’m not sick. I just find most people childish and dull," he replied flatly.

She nodded. "I understand. You prefer intelligent people like Uncle Lucas. But as you grow older, you’ll realize that those who aren’t as brilliant still have their own worth. Kindness, sincerity—those matter too."

Henry didn’t argue, though he clearly disagreed.

Maybe one day, he’d understand.

Zoe arrived home at seven that evening. She unwrapped the gift she’d received earlier, her excitement fading as she examined it.

This wasn’t something Dominic had chosen himself.

The assistant had delivered it—meaning Nathan had probably picked it out.

She was right. Dominic had delegated the task, and Nathan had settled on a Chavel handbag.

Zoe stared at it, Avery’s face flashing in her mind.

Dominic had lied for her.

He claimed Sophia wasn’t feeling well, that he needed to stay home with her. But the truth? He’d stayed for Evelyn.

He’d canceled their date—for Evelyn.

Normally, she wouldn’t care. But today was her birthday.

The disrespect stung.

The next day at Thornfield Industries…

The receptionist called up. "Miss Thorne, there’s a woman here to see you—Dominic Blackwood’s girlfriend."

Evelyn’s secretary confirmed, "We verified with Blackwood Group. She is indeed his new partner."

Evelyn set down her pen. After a brief hesitation, she headed downstairs.

Zoe stood in the lobby, dressed simply—no makeup, just a white tee and jeans. The casual look made her seem younger.

"Miss Thorne," Zoe greeted with a polite smile. "I heard you studied under Professor Whitmore. I was hoping we could chat over lunch today… if you’re free?"

Her tone was light, but Evelyn knew better. Still, she agreed.

They chose a nearby restaurant.

Once seated, Zoe smiled. "You started Thornfield Industries right after graduation? Impressive. I’ve just been working at the hospital—not nearly as glamorous."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Didn’t Dominic pay you for treating Sophia? He spent a billion searching for her. Surely he compensated you properly?"

Zoe’s smile tightened. "He offered a billion. But I couldn’t accept it."

"Ah. Because taking it would ruin your chances of dating him?" Evelyn said bluntly.

Zoe stiffened.

"Forgive my directness," Evelyn added, sipping her tea. "Just an observation."

Zoe forced a laugh. "It’s fine. I know you resent me. Without me, maybe you’d have another shot with Dominic."

Evelyn leaned forward. "You misunderstand. I don’t dislike you because of Dominic."

Zoe blinked. "Then why?"

"Because of how shamelessly you inserted yourself into this mess," Evelyn said coolly.

Zoe’s expression faltered. "Are you saying I stole him from you?"

###Chapter 196

Evelyn nearly choked on her jasmine tea. She grabbed a napkin to wipe her lips.

"Miss Montgomery, let me make this clear—I was the one who filed for divorce from Dominic. As for you 'taking' him from me?" Evelyn scoffed. "What bothers me is that you're not even married yet! Look at you two—he's devastatingly handsome, you're stunningly beautiful, a match made in heaven! When's the wedding? I'll send an extravagant gift!"

Zoe's smile faltered. "Now I understand your perspective. But I'm afraid I must disappoint you—we have no immediate plans to marry."

"Why not?" Evelyn took another sip, eyes sharp. "Is it you who's reluctant? Or him? If it's him, I'd be happy to have a little chat with him on your behalf."

Zoe stiffened. "That won't be necessary. We prefer to let things unfold naturally." She tilted her head. "Miss Thorne, earlier you called me 'insensitive.' I don't understand why you'd insult me at our first meeting."

Evelyn saw right through the act.

The way Zoe's eyes shimmered with manufactured hurt—it was almost impressive. Almost.

"Didn't they teach you in medical school about the dangers of greed?" Evelyn's voice was honeyed steel.

Zoe blinked, waiting.

Evelyn suppressed an eye roll.

Was this woman seriously playing dumb?

If Zoe had simply taken Dominic's money for Sophia's treatment, Evelyn might have respected her. But this?

Demanding his affection as payment?

Disgusting.

Even divorced, Evelyn couldn't stand seeing Dominic manipulated like this.

"Miss Thorne, do you truly believe I'm overstepping by wanting to be with Dominic?" Zoe pressed.

When Evelyn remained silent, Zoe continued, "You may not realize—Sophia's condition requires ongoing treatment. My primary practice was overseas. Dominic requested I relocate permanently to oversee her care. I sacrificed my international career for this."

"How noble," Evelyn drawled. "Though I heard St. Elizabeth pays poorly. Surely Dominic offered generous compensation? Unless..." Her gaze turned razor-sharp. "...you're aiming for more than money. Half his empire, perhaps?"

Zoe's face whitened. "Are you jealous? Because my surgical skills surpass yours?"

Evelyn's appetite vanished.

"Jealous?" Evelyn feigned a gasp. "How could I compare to you? We both studied under Professor Whitmore, yet you're the prodigy while I'm... what was it you called me? 'Mediocre'?" She leaned forward. "Funny—Dominic paid a fortune for Sebastian to treat Sophia, yet he refused to operate. But you? You waltzed in and solved everything. My, my... you must be better than the great Sebastian Whitmore himself."

Zoe's composure cracked.

The barb landed—Evelyn saw it in the twitch of her manicured fingers.

Good.

Zoe recovered quickly. "Evelyn, your bitterness is showing. I earned my skills through hard work. If you'd applied yourself—"

"Ah yes, the legendary 'surgeon's hands.'" Evelyn cut her off. "Sebastian's favorite party trick—telling students they were 'born to hold a scalpel.'"

Zoe extended her hands, pride flashing. "He wasn't wrong."

Evelyn refused to look.

This was absurd.

Were they really having this conversation?

Zoe kept waving her hands like some deranged hand model.

Evelyn reached out to push them away—

"Ah!" Zoe shrieked.

The teapot toppled.

Boiling water cascaded over those precious, "irreplaceable" hands.

###Chapter 197 

Evelyn stared in disbelief at her own terrible acting.

In her mind, she had envisioned a scene straight out of a dramatic romance—where the heroine confronts her rival with sharp words and fiery defiance.

But reality was far less graceful.

The staff rushed over immediately, helping Zoe Montgomery to her feet as they tended to her burned hands.

Evelyn remained seated, a cold unease settling in her chest.

Now that Zoe was injured, she held the advantage. She could claim it was an accident. Or worse—she could insist Evelyn had done it deliberately. And given Zoe’s position, her words would carry weight.

Evelyn signaled for the bill.

It didn’t take long for news of the incident to reach Dominic Blackwood.

Of all the parts of Zoe’s body, her hands were the most precious to him.

Because those hands were meant to perform surgery on Sophia.

And now, Evelyn had burned them.

“Evelyn wouldn’t do this,” Dominic said firmly.

His bodyguard handed over the surveillance footage.

The camera angle captured Evelyn perfectly—showing how, when she pushed Zoe’s hands away, the teapot tipped over.

Dominic’s jaw tightened as he watched. “She didn’t mean to.”

He knew Evelyn. She wasn’t capable of something like this.

The footage had no sound.

If Zoe hadn’t thrust her hands in front of Evelyn, Evelyn wouldn’t have pushed them aside.

The bodyguard hadn’t expected Dominic to defend her.

“Sir, we have the audio recording,” the bodyguard said, pressing play.

"Look at how perfect you two are together! He’s striking, you’re stunning—it’s like fate! When’s the wedding? I’ll send an extravagant gift!"

"Why not? Don’t you want to? Or does he not? If he refuses, I could always talk to him for you..."

Dominic’s expression darkened with every word.

His fingers clenched into fists.

Evelyn’s words were like knives.

She wanted him to marry Zoe?

How absurd.

At Thornfield Industries, Evelyn waited for Dominic’s call.

Zoe had gone to such lengths to stage this incident. Now was her chance to twist the story in her favor.

Then—her phone rang.

Dominic’s name flashed on the screen.

She answered.

His voice was low, controlled.

“Evelyn. Zoe’s hands were burned. Did you do it on purpose?”
###Chapter 198

Evelyn's breath hitched when Dominic's accusatory tone pierced through the phone.

"Your little girlfriend must have given you quite the sob story," she countered, her fingers tightening around her phone.

Dominic froze. He hadn't even seen Zoe since the incident.

The damning recording had sent him spiraling, making him dial Evelyn's number in a blind rage.

"Evelyn, answer the damn question! Stop deflecting!" His voice turned dangerously low this time.

The sharp command ignited Evelyn's temper. "Isn't it obvious? I scalded your precious Zoe's hand with boiling water! Tell her to stay the hell away from me unless she wants her pretty face melted next!"

Silence stretched between them.

Evelyn scoffed. "Cat got your tongue? No passionate defense for your beloved?"

She heard his sharp intake of breath, teeth grinding audibly.

"If Dr. Montgomery's hands are permanently damaged, who's going to operate on Sophia? Oh dear," Evelyn continued mockingly, "I'm suddenly so worried. Tell me, Dominic Blackwood, are you going to make me pay for this?"

"Evelyn Thorne, even a child could see through your bullshit!" Dominic exploded. "But damn if your words don't make me want to strangle you!"

A crisp knock interrupted their heated exchange.

"Enter!" Evelyn called out, not breaking eye contact with her office door.

Her assistant stepped in, oblivious to the ongoing call. "Miss Thorne, a Mr. Julian Whitmore claims to be an old friend. He's insisting on seeing you."

Evelyn smirked at her phone. "Your darling nephew's here. We're done talking."

She ended the call with a decisive click and strode to the private bathroom.

Five minutes later, Julian swaggered into her office behind her assistant.

Evelyn had composed herself, but the sight of that smarmy face made her stomach churn.

The door clicked shut behind her assistant.

"Evelyn, I can't believe you're back in town!" Julian's grin didn't reach his eyes. "The whole six hundred million dollar building purchase for Thornfield Industries was all over the news. I would've come sooner, but... pressing matters."

He took a step closer, that familiar predatory gleam in his eyes.

"Julian, you've somehow become even more repulsive," Evelyn deadpanned. "What do you want?"

"Can't an old flame just want to reconnect—"

"Let's reconnect over Victoria's death then." Evelyn rounded her desk, ready to play his game.

Julian's face paled. "She's gone. Why dredge up the past?"

"Such touching devotion," Evelyn sneered. "You two were practically glued together at Dominic and my wedding. Or has your goldfish memory failed you?" Watching his complexion shift between red and white, she pressed on, "If this is how you treat women you've slept with, why bother pretending to remember me?"

Julian's jaw clenched, but the calculating gleam in his eyes remained. He needed something from her—that much was clear.

"Since we're clearly not here for nostalgia," Evelyn crossed her arms, "let me guess—money troubles? Or did you come to offer me a loan since starting a business is so exhausting?" Her laugh was razor-sharp. "How's Veritas Capital these days? Still bleeding money? If you're offering financial help, I assume it's interest-free?"

Julian's mouth opened and closed like a stranded fish.

Regret radiated from every pore. This had been a mistake.

Evelyn was just warming up.

"Evelyn, must we always be at each other's throats?" Julian attempted a conciliatory tone.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen, alerting Sophie while keeping her voice light. "At each other's throats? I'm doing you a favor, Julian. You're what—thirty? Still trying to sleep your way to fortune?" She tilted her head. "Honestly, I'd get more loyalty from a stray dog."

###Chapter 199

Julian's voice cracked with indignation. "Evelyn! Are you comparing me to a dog?!"

Evelyn smirked. "Absolutely. I know Victoria well enough to realize she wouldn’t dare hire an assassin."

She crossed her arms, her gaze icy. "But honestly, I couldn’t care less about either of you. Whether you live or die means nothing to me. Keep bothering me, and I won’t hesitate to dig into this mess myself."

Julian’s expression darkened. "Evelyn! I wasn’t here for you—I just happened to pass by. We’ll talk another time!"

She hadn’t expected her offhand remark to rattle him so easily.

Julian despised Dominic but lacked the nerve to use his name to hire a hitman, leaving Victoria to take the fall.

Her phone buzzed with a new message.

Evelyn unlocked it—Sophie’s name flashed on the screen: How could Dominic stoop so low?! Calling you for that woman! What’s wrong with him? He should know you better than this!

Julian noticed her distraction and stood to leave.

Then, by chance, he caught a glimpse of her chat background—two children, a boy and a girl.

The girl’s face struck him as eerily familiar.

"Evelyn, who’s that girl in the photo?" Julian took a step closer, curiosity piqued. "I think I’ve seen her before..."

She jerked her phone away, her glare sharp enough to cut glass. "Leave. Now."

He flinched, raising his hands in surrender. "Fine, I’m going. But that girl—the one who’s been harassing me—she looks just like the one in your picture. Maybe I’m mistaken. I’ll go."

Once he was gone, unease coiled in Evelyn’s chest.

Had Lily sought Julian out?

She knew Lily and Henry had been skipping school lately. She hadn’t pressed them, assuming they needed time to readjust after returning. She’d given them space—too much, perhaps.

The more she thought about it, the more it unsettled her.

Why would they go to Julian?

To her, he was just as dangerous as Dominic.

Meanwhile.

After his call with Evelyn, Dominic went to check on Zoe.

Her hands were wrapped in bandages, the burns hidden beneath layers of gauze.

"Did you see a doctor?" he asked, his voice tight.

She shook her head. "I can handle it myself."

"How bad is it?"

Another shake. "Not sure. It just hurts... a lot."

Dominic’s jaw clenched. "Why did you go to Evelyn? We’re divorced. You had no business involving her."

Zoe’s eyes welled with tears. "I’m sorry, Dominic. I heard she studied under Professor Whitmore. I thought we might have common ground. I didn’t expect... this."

A pained gasp escaped her as fresh tears spilled over.

Dominic sighed, his frustration dissolving at the sight of her distress.

"It hurts so much," she whimpered, leaning into him. Her voice cracked. "What if the burns are bad? What if I can’t operate again?"

Without another word, he scooped her into his arms. "I’m taking you to the hospital."

Zoe looped her arms around his neck, pressing close.

A sly smile curled her lips as he carried her away.
###Chapter 200

The clock struck six in the evening.

Evelyn was driving back to Mooncrest Manor when she noticed the gates were already open.

A sleek red BMW sat parked in the front courtyard.

Evelyn immediately recognized the vehicle - it belonged to Sophie.

Why would Sophie show up unannounced?

"Evelyn!"

Sophie came running out the moment she spotted Evelyn's car. "I met your two children! If I hadn't heard from others about your adoption, were you planning to keep this from me forever?"

Hearing Sophie's accusatory tone, Evelyn hesitated before stepping out of her car.

She realized with frustration that whenever Dominic discovered anything about her, the whole world seemed to know!

And whatever Sophie found out would inevitably reach Dominic's ears!

She couldn't exactly cut ties with Sophie just because she was dating Adrian Vaughn, though she understood Sophie's close connection to Jun Hertz.

"How could you?!" Sophie marched over and practically dragged Evelyn from the car. "It's just adopting two children! Why the secrecy?"

Evelyn found herself at a loss for words...

"And those adopted kids look exactly like you and Dominic! Did you choose them because they're beautiful?" Sophie pressed.

Evelyn shrugged. "...Yes! Henry didn't resemble Dominic when he was younger. If he had, I wouldn't have adopted him."

Sophie gasped. "How extraordinary! They look so alike despite being unrelated!"

"Who knows? Children's appearances change dramatically as they grow." Evelyn replied guiltily.

"But Evelyn... why adopt children at all?" Sophie looked genuinely puzzled. "Your mother mentioned Henry has... challenges. Isn't that exhausting?"

Understanding Sophie's concern came from a good place, Evelyn explained patiently, "Sophie, children are blessings, even with their difficulties."

"I'm not saying they're bad, I just worry it must be tiring for you."

"He's a wonderful child. Never causes any trouble." Evelyn moved to change her shoes.

Just then, Henry and Lily came bounding over.

"Mommy, is Aunt Sophie your best friend? She bought me so many pretty dresses and hair clips! Can I keep them?" Lily asked eagerly, her chin tilted upward.

"Of course! Aunt Sophie is my dearest friend."

"Oh... thank you, Aunt Sophie!" Lily beamed.

Sophie affectionately ruffled Lily's hair. "It's too bad Henry didn't like the gift I brought him."

Lily piped up helpfully, "Aunt Sophie, my brother loves puzzles. Next time bring him a really hard one! He solves the easy ones too quickly."

Sophie nodded enthusiastically. "I'll get one tomorrow! Lily, you're absolutely gorgeous - you look just like your mother when she was little!"

Lily declared proudly, "I'm Mommy's daughter, of course I look like her!"

Sophie stood speechless...

Evelyn quickly pulled the stunned Sophie into the bedroom.

"Evelyn! Those are your biological children, aren't they? No wonder they resemble you and Dominic so much!" Before Evelyn could respond, Sophie cut in sharply, "Don't you dare lie to me! If you do, I'll tell Dominic they're his!"

Evelyn's mouth opened and closed wordlessly.

She should have known better than to think she could keep such secrets forever.

The only way to maintain them would have been to never return and avoid everyone she knew.

But the world proved too small for that. Now it was far too late.
###Chapter 201

Sophie knew.

"Evelyn, why haven't you told Dominic? If he discovers those are his children..."

"He doesn't want children, Sophie. If you breathe a word of this to anyone - even Dominic - our friendship ends here."

Evelyn's voice was ice, her expression even colder, as if an entirely different person stood before her.

"If this is serious, of course I'll keep quiet. This is your private matter and I'll guard your secret." Sophie wrung her hands nervously. "I truly don't understand Dominic. What do you think - is there something wrong with him mentally?"

"Quite possibly." Evelyn perched on the edge of the bed, articulating each syllable clearly. "All I want is to raise my children until they're grown."

"Evelyn, don't worry. I swear on my life I won't tell a soul about this."

At the Blackwood family estate.

Dominic returned home at seven in the evening.

"Dominic, is Zoe alright? How could she be so careless? A doctor's hands are their most valuable asset!" Eleanor had heard about Zoe's burns and was visibly distressed.

"It's nothing serious." Dominic didn't want his mother worrying unnecessarily.

He'd taken Zoe to the hospital himself and seen the damage to her hands firsthand.

The burns were severe.

The skin surface was completely destroyed.

"That's good. We need Zoe to treat Sophia's condition!" Eleanor murmured under her breath.

"Mother, let's not discuss this now." Dominic guided his mother to the dining table and seated her.

A lavish spread covered the table. The entire family had waited for his return before eating.

"Uncle, remember that girl I mentioned?" Julian couldn't contain his curiosity any longer. "When I visited Evelyn this afternoon, I saw a photo of the same girl on her phone."

Dominic's movements stilled, his eyes darkening.

"I'm certain it's the same girl who approached me. The resemblance to Evelyn is uncanny - I'd recognize her anywhere! I suspect she's Evelyn's biological daughter." Julian shared his theory with Dominic.

Dominic's fork clattered onto his plate.

Gregory glared at his son. "Don't spread baseless rumors! And what were you doing visiting Evelyn today? Even though your uncle is divorced, she's still your former aunt! Get a grip!"

Julian shrugged. "Dad, I was passing by Thornfield Industries and decided to stop by. I won't go looking for her again." He muttered under his breath, "Evelyn's words cut sharper than any blade. Poisonous woman."

Dominic shifted restlessly before abruptly standing.

"Dominic, you haven't finished dinner! Even if Evelyn has a daughter, she's not yours! Why are you so worked up?"

Eleanor grasped her son's arm, attempting to reason with him. "You have Zoe now - don't go running back to Evelyn."

That night, sleep eluded Dominic.

He'd never met Evelyn's daughter.

He wondered about her appearance. Was she adopted? Or Evelyn's biological child?

An insistent voice in his gut whispered that Evelyn was hiding something significant from him.

He couldn't trust anything she said.

Including her supposed intentional burning of Zoe. How could he believe such a claim?

Zoe's act of recording their conversation to give to the bodyguard had disgusted him.

He despised indirect, scheming women like her.

Though he and Evelyn fought constantly, she would never resort to such underhanded tactics.

At dawn, red-eyed and hoarse, he called his assistant. "Find me Evelyn's current address."

###Chapter 202 

Two warring voices clashed inside Dominic's mind. One screamed at him to stay away from Evelyn forever. The other whispered relentlessly about finding Lily.

Even if the child wasn't his, he needed to see her. To discover how much of Evelyn lived in those young features.

And that man living with them! The thought sent white-hot fury through his veins.

At Mooncrest Manor

Sophie arrived with the jigsaw puzzle she'd promised Lily.

To her surprise, Adrian answered the door shirtless.

"Must you always be half-naked?" Sophie scolded, crossing her arms. "Clara and Lily are here! Have some decency!"

Adrian rubbed his sleepy eyes. "Where's breakfast? Those pastries you brought last time were decent."

Sophie rolled her eyes.

She placed the puzzle on the entry table and headed toward the master suite.

The bed stood perfectly made. Empty.

"Is Evelyn at work already?" Sophie called out, returning to the living area.

Adrian stretched lazily. "If she's not here, she's working. Basic logic."

"And Clara? Taking Lily to preschool?"

Adrian finally pulled on a wrinkled tee. "If she's gone, she's out. More basic logic."

Sophie followed him like a detective. "You're not sharing a room? Doesn't seem very... couple-like."

"Nosy much?" Adrian smirked. "Even if we sleep apart, no man gets closer to Evelyn than I do."

The scent of pancakes led them to the kitchen where Clara had left breakfast.

Sophie cornered Adrian as he ate. "How did you two meet? Evelyn doesn't date multiple men. Was this after the divorce?"

Adrian slurped his coffee. "Ask Evelyn. If she won't tell you, I can't." He grinned. "But I'll trade secrets for secrets."

Sophie's eyes narrowed. "You're impossible! Is this how you treat Evelyn too?"

"Of course not." Adrian's expression softened. "For Evelyn, I'd move mountains. Just say the word." The intensity in his gaze made Sophie shiver.

"You never even told me your name! I'm Sophie, Evelyn's best friend since Ravenswood University."

"Adrian Vaughn." He wiped his mouth. "Now give me something useful."

Sophie took a dramatic sip of water. "Did you know someone set Evelyn up yesterday?"

Adrian's fork clattered. "What?"

"Your turn first. What's your full name?"

"Adrian Vaughn. Now spill."

Sophie leaned in. "Do you know Dominic Blackwood? His new girlfriend Zoe Montgomery had lunch with Evelyn and—"

"That witch threw boiling water at Evelyn?!" Adrian shot up, knocking over his chair.

"Worse!" Sophie grabbed his arm. "She poured it on herself! Then blamed Evelyn! Can you believe it?"

Adrian's knuckles turned white. "Evelyn cries when she steps on ants! She'd never hurt anyone!"

"And get this—stupid Dominic called to accuse her! Makes my blood boil!"

Adrian's laugh was dangerous. "If it were me, I'd have cursed him into next week."

Sophie gasped. "That's extreme!"

"Extreme?" Adrian's eyes darkened. "Zoe wants to play games? Let's see how she likes my rules."

His phone was already in hand, plotting revenge with terrifying precision.

###Chapter 203

Meanwhile, Henry strode confidently toward them.

Sophie gasped in surprise. Why wasn't Henry in school today?

Adrian looked equally shocked. "Hey Big H! Skipping classes? Let's go grab some burgers!"

Sophie's jaw dropped.

This content belongs to NovelDrama.Org.

Did Adrian just call Henry "Big H"?

With a firm grip, Henry pulled Adrian away by the arm.

Sophie stood frozen in place.

Their closeness was undeniable.

No wonder Adrian had won Evelyn's affection. He clearly got along well with her children.

At Blackwood Group headquarters...

Dominic had just arrived when Nathan entered with his daily report.

After finishing, Nathan adjusted his glasses. "Mr. Blackwood, Miss Thorne is currently residing at Mooncrest Manor. Are you planning to visit? Given your divorce, she might not welcome you."

Nathan wanted to spare Dominic potential embarrassment.

Dominic's expression darkened. "Nathan, continue searching for specialists to treat Sophia. Money is no object - just find someone who can help her."

Nathan looked surprised. "Is Miss Montgomery no longer treating Sophia?"

A sharp glance from Dominic made everything clear.

"That was crossing the line, using Sophia's treatment as leverage." Nathan shook his head. "I'll keep searching. By the way, Miss Thorne has been working late every night at Thornfield Industries recently."

"I need to see her daughter. Rumor has it she's Evelyn's spitting image." Dominic confessed, "I believe she's hiding something from me."

Nathan nodded. "Understood. Perhaps visit in the evening? My contact also mentioned the blonde Operations Director - goes by Adrian."

"Operations Director?" Dominic's eyes flashed with interest. "Is he competent?"

Nathan frowned. "His background is... unusual. No digital footprint, and foreign records are inaccessible. He's quite the enigma."

Dominic's gaze lowered.

An unknown variable?

How did Evelyn meet such a person?

"Have your source monitor him closely. I want a full profile." Dominic ordered.

Nathan smiled knowingly. "Already instructed. Honestly, I doubt Evelyn would be involved with Adrian. He's nothing like you - people don't change their preferences so drastically."

Dominic twirled a pen thoughtfully. "Julian mentioned Evelyn's daughter visited him twice. Evelyn wouldn't have sent her alone. Someone else must be pulling strings."

"You suspect Adrian?"

"Uncertain. The whole situation feels off."

"Agreed. Willowbrook Academy's servers were hacked recently. Could be Adrian's doing."

"Which is precisely why we need more intel on this man."

At 5 PM...

Clara arrived at the kindergarten to pick up Lily.

"Grandma! Two boys offered me candy today but I said no!" Lily pouted. "I'm not greedy! And big brother said never to play with boys - it's bad luck!"

Clara raised an eyebrow. "Your brother actually said that?"

Lily nodded vigorously. "Uh-huh! He said except him and Uncle Adrian, all boys are meanies!"

Her sparkling eyes suddenly caught sight of a tall, broad-shouldered figure standing before their house. "Grandma! Who's that man at our gate? He's super tall!"

###Chapter 204 

The moment Dominic Blackwood spotted Evelyn Thorne approaching, his breath caught in his throat. "Hello, Clara," he greeted her mother instead, his voice carefully neutral.

Clara Thorne's expression turned glacial. "Did Evelyn invite you here?"

Dominic's jaw tightened. "No."

"Then why are you trespassing?" Clara's words were razor-sharp. "The divorce was finalized years ago. Stop disrupting our peace."

Mooncrest Manor's wrought-iron gates stood firmly closed between them. Dominic's gaze flickered from the barrier to Clara's unyielding face. He took a measured step back. "My apologies for the intrusion."

As he turned to leave, movement caught his eye—a flash of pink behind the hydrangeas. A small figure crouched there, watching.

Lily.

His chest constricted. He ached to sweep his daughter into his arms, but not like this. Not when he'd become an unwelcome specter in their lives.

The moment Dominic's car disappeared down Hawthorne Avenue, Lily burst from the bushes.

"Grandma! Why did Daddy leave?"

Clara grasped the child's sticky hand, leading her toward the villa. "How do you know that man was your father?"

"Because Mommy keeps his pictures in a locked box!" Lily kicked a pebble, her lower lip trembling. "Henry says we'll never have a real dad now. Just stupid stepdaddies who'll make us eat broccoli."

Clara stifled a laugh. "Your mother's still young, sweetheart. The right man will—"

"Noooo!" Lily wailed dramatically. "Henry and I voted! No stepdaddies ever! Not even if they bring ponies!"

Inside Thornfield Industries' rebuilt headquarters, Evelyn Thorne adjusted her emerald-green blazer. The celebratory dinner for her company's relaunch had stretched late into the evening.

She slipped away from the banquet hall, only to freeze at the sight awaiting her in the parking lot—Clara clutching Henry's hand while Lily attempted to scale a lamppost.

"Mom? What are you—"

"Someone demanded an emergency mommy inspection," Clara said dryly as Lily launched herself at Evelyn.

Evelyn caught her daughter mid-leap. "You little spy! Did Henry put you up to this?"

The boy shook his head solemnly. "Uncle Nathan showed me the drone prototypes. They have laser targeting now."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "Nathan Cross was here?"

Clara's grip tightened on her purse. "Not him. The other one."

A block away, Dominic stood shrouded in shadows, his knuckles white around his car keys. The scene before him—Evelyn laughing as Lily tugged her hair, Henry demonstrating some elaborate handshake with Clara—was a life that should have been his.

"Sir?" Nathan murmured. "The girl looks just like you at that age."

Dominic's throat worked. "It doesn't matter. The past is dead."

"But if you just—"

"Enough." Dominic's voice cracked like ice. "We're here for one purpose—get close to Nathan Mercer. Not to reopen old wounds."

As Evelyn's car pulled away, Dominic remained motionless, the streetlight carving his profile into sharp relief. Some distances couldn't be measured in miles. Some doors, once closed, could never be reopened.

Not even for love.

###Chapter 205

The formal dinner at Thornfield Industries concluded, but the night was far from over. A round of after-party entertainment had been arranged.

Nathan Cross’s friend had promised to include him in the gathering.

This was Nathan’s chance to get closer to Adrian Vaughn.

After Evelyn Thorne and her family settled into the car, Nathan turned to Dominic Blackwood. “Mr. Blackwood, you should rest. Zoe Montgomery’s hands are injured—you haven’t visited her today, have you? She might be disappointed if you don’t check on her.”

Dominic had been working relentlessly all day. Nathan could see the exhaustion weighing on him, the way he used work to distract himself from everything else.

But avoidance wouldn’t last forever.

Sophia Blackwood still needed Zoe’s treatment. As Zoe’s boyfriend, Dominic couldn’t afford to be distant for long.

About thirty minutes after Dominic left, Nathan’s friend emerged from the restaurant with a group of men in tow—including Adrian Vaughn.

“Our Director of Operations is treating us to drinks at the bar,” Nathan’s friend announced, clapping him on the shoulder. “Nathan, I remember you can hold your liquor. Come join us.” He lowered his voice. “Honestly, he seems more like a brother to Miss Thorne than anything else. Couples don’t usually act like that. You know what I mean? Maybe find out more when you drink with him.”

Nathan was both surprised and pleased.

If Adrian was just a friend to Evelyn, that would be perfect.

For the past two days, Dominic had been in a foul mood because of Adrian and Evelyn.

But since they were already divorced, there was nothing Dominic could do.

“To be honest, I’m not sure about my boss’s relationship with Sophia,” Nathan murmured. “They’re not together, but… there’s something there. I can’t explain it. Don’t spread that around, though—he’d fire me on the spot.”

His friend chuckled. “Same goes for what I told you. He’s our Director of Operations. If he’s not into men, he’ll definitely have my head.”

“Deal.”

At the bar, the dim lighting and flowing alcohol made it easy to lose track of reality.

Adrian had already downed two drinks when Nathan’s friend pulled him into the group.

“Director, this is my friend Nathan. He’s got a strong tolerance—let him keep you company!”

Adrian’s gaze flicked to Nathan.

Nathan had an unremarkable face, but his eyes were striking—clear and sharp, the kind Adrian hadn’t seen in years.

“How much can you drink?” Adrian asked, clinking his glass against Nathan’s.

Nathan shrugged. “Half a bottle, max. I don’t usually drink much.”

Adrian smirked. “That’s not much. Well, then drink half a bottle with me.” His cheeks were flushed, a stark contrast to his pale neck.

Nathan matched him drink for drink. From their conversation and the way Adrian held eye contact, Nathan didn’t get the impression he was interested in men.

But his friend had insisted Adrian might be, so Nathan decided to test the waters.

Taking a deep breath, he subtly shifted his leg closer to Adrian’s under the table.

Adrian noticed—and stiffened in surprise.

Nathan coughed and pulled back.

But Adrian didn’t move away.

That… was telling.

Still, Nathan wasn’t entirely convinced.

They finished their second round, chatting casually—until Adrian suddenly leaned forward, his leg pressing firmly against Nathan’s.

Skin against skin. No space between them.

Nathan’s breath hitched.

Okay. Adrian was definitely into men.

But Nathan wasn’t.

He stood abruptly, ready to leave—only for Adrian to grab him and pull him into a tight embrace.

###Chapter 206

At 5 a.m., Dominic's phone buzzed with an incoming text.

He didn’t wake up until two hours later, blinking at the message from Nathan.

(Sir, according to Lucas, he's an expert hacker.)

(He's gay.)

(I'd like to take the day off, Sir.)

Dominic's brow furrowed as he read the three messages.

How had Nathan uncovered so much critical information in just one night?

Lucas wasn’t the type to reveal personal details easily.

He wouldn’t just spill secrets to a stranger without reason.

Suspicion gnawing at him, Dominic dialed Nathan’s number.

"Nathan, how did you get all that from Lucas?"

A brief silence stretched before Nathan answered, exhaustion lacing his voice. "We were drinking last night. He told me after a few rounds."

"That’s it?"

"Yeah. And I drank too much. Need the day off."

"Fine. Rest up."

Nathan’s eyes burned red when the call ended.

No one would believe what had happened to him.

And he had no intention of ever speaking about it.

The humiliation was too much.

At eight in the morning, Evelyn was preparing to take the kids to school at Mooncrest Manor.

"Didn’t Uncle Lucas come home last night, Mommy?" Lily asked, adjusting her backpack with a curious tilt of her head. "I checked his room—he wasn’t there!"

Evelyn had called Lucas at 11 p.m. the previous night.

He’d claimed he was out drinking.

When she tried again at midnight, he hadn’t answered.

"Probably stayed at a hotel," Evelyn said dismissively. "Don’t worry. He’ll be fine."

Lucas had always enjoyed his nightlife—staying out wasn’t unusual for him.

"Oh. Are you and Uncle Lucas getting married?" Lily pressed, eyes wide with mischief. "I wouldn’t mind if you did."

Evelyn stifled a mix of amusement and irritation.

"Mommy would never marry Uncle Lucas. Stop imagining things."

"But Henry and I really like him!"

"I know you do, and we’ll always be friends," Evelyn said, ushering them toward the door—only to freeze at the sight of the sleek Rolls-Royce parked outside.

Dominic stood beside it, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn and the children.

Their expressions darkened instantly.

Why was he here at eight in the morning?

When had he arrived?

What did he want?

Evelyn’s pulse spiked, her feet suddenly leaden.

From inside, Clara noticed their hesitation and stepped out.

"What’s wrong, Evelyn?" she called, crossing the yard.

The moment she spotted Dominic, her face flushed with rage.

Evelyn lunged forward, catching her mother’s arm before she could charge.

"Take the kids to school, Mom!"

Panic tightened her grip as Clara seethed.

"I forgot to tell you—he showed up last night too. What’s he doing lurking around like this?" Clara hissed, trembling with fury.
###Chapter 207

Evelyn glanced at the children before turning to Clara. "Take them to school. I'm certain he has his reasons for showing up unannounced."

As Clara ushered the children past Dominic, his gaze locked onto Lily's face.

The resemblance between mother and daughter was undeniable.

Lily's sparkling wide eyes held a glimmer of defiance as she glared at him while walking by.

What could possibly have been planted in that young mind to make her despise him so intensely?

Evelyn approached Dominic moments later.

"What brings you here at this ungodly hour?"

Dominic studied Evelyn's fresh, makeup-free face before asking with a conflicted expression, "Is she truly your biological daughter? The resemblance is striking."

"Did you come all this way just to scrutinize my child?"

"Who's her father?" Dominic demanded, voice rising. "She must be at least four if she's already in preschool."

Evelyn realized she couldn't possibly claim Lily was adopted this time.

The mother-daughter resemblance was too perfect - like someone had cloned a miniature version of Evelyn herself.

"You're right. She's mine biologically, but you're not the father," Evelyn answered with a bitter smile. "I used an anonymous sperm donor from an overseas fertility clinic to fulfill my dream of motherhood."

What a dream indeed.

Dominic stood speechless, rendered mute by her casual admission.

"If that's all you came for, you can leave now," Evelyn said dismissively.

Dominic's expression darkened. "That man living with you - he's gay."

Evelyn's smile froze.

"How could you possibly know that?"

Mike's personal information was completely untraceable online.

As the world's most notorious hacker, his identity remained sealed unless he chose to reveal it.

Dominic seemed relieved by her reaction.

"So you already knew."

"Don't you have better things to do, Dominic? How's your girlfriend's recovery progressing? How's Sophia doing? With all these women vying for your attention, why waste your precious energy on me? Do you honestly believe there's anything left between us?"

Evelyn shoved Dominic forcefully before turning toward the house.

"Evelyn! My relationship with Sophia isn't what you think!" Dominic called after her retreating figure, fists clenched.

Evelyn gritted her teeth.

How many nights had she waited to hear those words?

She'd given him countless opportunities to explain himself before.

Why now? What exactly was he trying to salvage at this point?

"Are you enjoying this game, Dominic?" Evelyn spun around several paces away, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "The person who deserves your explanations and responsibility is Zoe Montgomery! Not me!"

Her words struck him like a physical blow, though he disagreed with her final assertion.

"I don't owe explanations or responsibility to any woman unless I choose to. You know I never loved Zoe."

"What does that matter to me? I couldn't care less who you date!" Evelyn snapped, each word piercing Dominic's heart. "You never truly loved me, and I won't be fooled again!"

If he had truly cared, he wouldn't have held back. He would have fought for her.

"You claim your relationship with Sophia isn't romantic," Evelyn continued, voice trembling. "Yet she remains the most important person in your life. Just let me go, Dominic! I'm done being your plaything!"

When Nathan returned to the office after his day off, he immediately noticed Dominic's mood had worsened.

Puzzled, he approached Lucas for answers.

"What's wrong with Mr. Blackwood?"

Lucas sighed into his coffee. "According to his driver, Dominic went to reconcile with Evelyn yesterday only to get brutally rejected."

"So my work-related injury was for nothing then."

"Work-related injury?"

Nathan gloomily recounted his bar encounter with Mike.

That afternoon, surrounded by bodyguards, Dominic arrived at Thornfield Industries radiating lethal energy.
###Chapter 208

Evelyn stormed into the tech department the second she got the alert.

"Our director isn't in today, Mr. Blackwood."

The manager of the department had no idea what was going on, but the icy fury radiating off Dominic was enough to confirm that Adrian had somehow crossed him.

"Maybe I should take you to the CEO instead?" the manager offered just as Evelyn stepped inside.

She moved toward Dominic, took one look at his thunderous expression, and said, "Let's discuss this in my office."

He must have come here looking for Adrian over some personal dispute.

Adrian hadn't mentioned anything to her, but given the murderous glint in Dominic's eyes, it had to be serious.

Once inside her office, Dominic and Lucas settled onto the couch while the bodyguard positioned himself by the door.

"What happened?" Evelyn asked as she poured them each a glass of water.

"Miss Thorne, I regret to inform you that your operations director… seduced Nathan," Lucas stated bluntly.

Evelyn's mouth went dry.

Nathan was Dominic's most trusted confidant—his shadow. Anyone who messed with Nathan might as well have challenged Dominic himself.

Her pulse spiked.

She never expected Adrian to do something so reckless!

Snatching her phone, she dialed Adrian. He picked up on the second ring.

"Get to the office. Now," she hissed under her breath.

"What? I'm at lunch—why are you yelling at me?" Adrian protested.

"Did you screw with Dominic Blackwood's assistant?"

"What? How would I even know who his assistant is?"

"Dominic Blackwood is sitting in my office right now. He wouldn't be here if this wasn't real!" Evelyn snapped, her breath coming faster. "Did you sleep with someone without even knowing his damn name?"

"Of course not! I've only been with one person since I got here—"

"His name?"

"Nathan. He ghosted me after that night."

Evelyn dragged in a slow, pained breath. "That is Dominic Blackwood's assistant. Get your ass here now."

Hanging up, she turned back to Dominic and Lucas, her face burning.

"How is Mr. Cross?" she asked carefully, forcing calm into her voice. "I apologize—Adrian didn’t tell me anything about this." Then, suspicion crept in. "How did they even meet?"

Outside of work, Adrian spent most of his time clubbing.

She couldn't fathom how he'd crossed paths with Nathan.

After a brief pause, Lucas explained, "Adrian went to a bar after your company dinner last week. Nathan was there too—though admittedly, he went to gather intel on Adrian."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn.

"So you sent Nathan Cross to get close to Adrian, and somehow, they ended up in bed together," she summarized, then turned to Dominic. "That’s how you found out Adrian was gay."

Seeing the tension between them, Lucas quickly interjected, "There's more to it, Miss Thorne. We investigated Adrian because our company was recently hacked. Our entire system was compromised—the hacker even left a taunting message on Dominic's computer. We suspect it's the same person who breached Willowbrook Academy."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Her fingers curled into fists. "Why suspect Adrian?"

"Because he's your director of operations. His technical skills must be exceptional. Plus, we found it suspicious that we couldn’t dig up any background on him," Lucas said. "And for the record, we never instructed Nathan to go that far. Adrian was the one who pressured him."

Evelyn dropped her gaze, her argument crumbling.

If Adrian really had forced himself on Nathan and hacked into both the school and Blackwood Group, then she couldn’t defend him.

There was nothing she could do.

Dominic would be showing mercy just by letting him live.

Moments later, Adrian strode into the office.
###Chapter 209

Dominic's office door flew open as Lucas stormed in, his usually composed features twisted with agitation.

"Evelyn! It was Nathan who started everything!" Lucas blurted out, his stormy gray eyes flashing with barely contained frustration. "We were just having drinks at first when his knee brushed against mine under the table. If it meant nothing, why did he keep doing it? That's clearly flirting!"

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson.

"Maybe Nathan was just testing the waters to see if you're into men," Lucas offered awkwardly, shifting his weight from one foot to the other.

But Lucas wasn't having any of it. "How was I supposed to know what he really wanted? Besides, he seemed to be enjoying himself plenty that night!"

The room plunged into stunned silence.

Dominic calmly lifted his water glass and took a slow sip.

Lucas followed suit, the ice cubes clinking loudly in the tense quiet.

Evelyn quickly changed the subject. "Did you ever hack into Willowbrook Academy's systems? And what about the security breach at Blackwood Group last month?"

Lucas raised both hands in surrender. "Not me! I'd own up to it if I did. Sure, my hacking skills are legendary, but this wasn't my doing." His gaze flicked meaningfully to Evelyn.

His eyes clearly said: "It was your kid."

Evelyn's mouth went dry. After an awkward pause, she forced a bright smile. "So... I haven't had lunch yet. Anyone hungry? My treat!"

She'd do anything to protect her son, even if it meant suffering through a meal with Dominic and Lucas.

"There's this amazing Mexican place down the street—"

Lucas shot Dominic a look and decided to help his boss save face. "Miss Thorne, actually—"

"Didn't you say you've been craving authentic Mexican?" Dominic smoothly cut in before Lucas could finish. "We'd love to join you."

Lucas blinked in confusion. Since when did he like Mexican food?

"Serves him right for putting me in this position," Lucas thought darkly.

"Could you set up a meeting with Nathan for me? We need to talk," Lucas asked, clearly uninterested in the lunch invitation.

"If you want to see him so badly, just go to Blackwood Group headquarters. I doubt you'll try anything funny on our turf," Lucas said pointedly.

Lucas looked genuinely offended. "I never forced him! At first he seemed hesitant, sure, but then he—"

Evelyn cut him off sharply. "Go apologize immediately! And if I hear about you harassing him again—"

"Yes, ma'am," Lucas mumbled, suddenly meek.

At the restaurant, Evelyn ordered several house specialties before passing the menu to Lucas, who handed it to Dominic without looking.

"I thought you loved Mexican food?" Evelyn asked pointedly.

"Dominic's a fan too," Lucas said with a smirk.

Evelyn swallowed hard. "So... how bad was the damage from that hacking incident?"

Both men had seen Lucas's silent communication with Evelyn earlier. Whoever the hacker was, they were clearly connected to her.

"Catastrophic," Lucas said gravely. "We lost a nine-figure contract that day—some competitor swooped in last minute. Worse yet, all the critical files on Dominic's personal computer were wiped clean. We're tracking down the perpetrator as we speak. When we find them, they'll face both civil and criminal charges."

Evelyn went pale.

Dominic took pity on her. "He's exaggerating. The financial loss is manageable, and I had backups of all essential files. But the hacker's taunting message did piss me off. When I find them, I'll make sure they regret it." His icy tone left no doubt about the seriousness of his threat.

###Chapter 210 

Her fingers trembled slightly as she gripped the edge of the table, struggling to keep her voice steady.

"What exactly... was the nature of this challenge?"

Dominic's dark brows drew together, his expression turning glacial. "Come try to choke me, you bastard!"

Evelyn's lips parted in shock.

Lucas didn't know whether to laugh or groan.

"I'm guessing the hacker's just a kid!"

"Not necessarily!" Evelyn countered quickly. "You can't determine age from one phrase!"

"Would an adult really use 'bastard' like that? Unless they're watching terrible daytime dramas."

To prove her point, Evelyn turned to Lucas and muttered, "Bastard," then swiveled to Dominic and repeated, "Bastard."

Both men froze, their expressions priceless.

"See? Perfectly normal vocabulary for adults," Evelyn declared, working overtime to protect her son.

Her telltale expression betrayed her anyway.

Lucas and Dominic exchanged knowing glances, reaching the same silent conclusion.

"How did you meet Mike, Miss Thorne?" Lucas smoothly changed topics. "He's quite the character. And remarkably obedient to you."

Evelyn sipped her water, fabricating quickly. "We met at a tech conference overseas. We're friends - there's no obedience involved."

"I see... Did he follow you to Eldermere?"

"He comes and goes as he pleases," Evelyn deflected, biting into a taco with forced nonchalance.

Meanwhile, Mike stood at Blackwood Group's reception, explaining himself to the skeptical front desk attendant.

"I'm sorry, but Mr. Cross requires appointments."

"It's lunch hour," Mike pointed out.

"Precisely! You may schedule for after two o'clock," the receptionist replied primly.

"That's not— Dominic Blackwood and Lucas Grant sent me. Surely you know them?"

The receptionist paled.

Who wouldn't recognize the CEO and CFO?

"One moment, sir." After a brief call, she turned back. "Mr. Cross declines to see you."

"I know he doesn't want to! But your bosses ordered me here. Who do you obey - him or them? Just take me to his office."

Determination burned in Mike's eyes. He needed to confront Nathan.

Reluctantly, the receptionist escorted him.

The moment Nathan saw Mike, fury darkened his features.

Mike slammed the office door shut. "You sneaky little spy!"

Nathan stood his ground. "I'll admit I had motives that night, but you—"

"Good! Evelyn chewed me out because of you! Made me come apologize!" Mike's voice dripped with indignation. "Which I won't be doing!"

Despite his anger, Mike remained eerily composed.

"None of this would've happened if you hadn't approached me first. Don't play victim now!"

"Delete my number!" Nathan ground out.

"With pleasure!" Mike whipped out his phone.

Simultaneously, Nathan purged Mike's contact.

"Let's pretend we never met. If we cross paths, we're strangers."

Mike scoffed. "I'd rather meet Satan himself!"

Their explosive confrontation ended with Mike storming out.

He ducked into a nearby café, ordering black coffee before calling Henry.

"Hey kid, your mom knows. I'm in hot water myself - you're on your own."

Henry sighed. "Guess I'll have to move up my timeline."

"Definitely! She'll probably take your laptop and read you the riot act. Dominic gave her hell today - she's in a mood! Maybe you should run away?"

Henry's voice softened. "I'd take any punishment over hurting Mommy."

###Chapter 211

Evelyn arrived home earlier than usual that evening.

As soon as Clara brought Henry home from school, she scooped up Lily and disappeared into the bedroom.

Little Henry immediately understood what was coming when he saw his grandmother carry his sister away.

"Hand me your backpack, Henry," Evelyn said, extending her palm toward her son.

With both hands, Henry obediently passed his school bag to his mother.

Evelyn unzipped the bag and retrieved the laptop.

She didn't power it on, but instead said sternly, "Uncle Lucas told me everything. You've been using the skills he taught you for all the wrong things. Do you realize that's illegal, Henry? Do you understand the consequences if you get caught?"

Without missing a beat, Henry replied, "I'm only four. Can they arrest a four-year-old?"

Evelyn found herself speechless.

Even with Dominic Blackwood's influence over Eldermere, sending a preschooler to prison would be impossible.

But that wasn't the real issue here.

The real problem was her son's moral compass was dangerously skewed.

"You won't stay four forever. You'll grow up," Evelyn said, trying to impart wisdom. "I can't let you repeat these mistakes, so I'm taking your laptop away for now."

"Uncle Lucas will just buy me a new one," Henry countered.

A sharp pain shot through Evelyn's temples as she sighed. "Are you determined to be difficult?!"

Henry shook his head. "I won't mess with Dominic Blackwood anymore."

As long as he left Dominic alone, no one would trace the cyber activities back to him.

"No dinner for you tonight," Evelyn declared, clutching the laptop to her chest as she marched toward her room. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

Henry knew his mother would never physically punish him, but seeing her distressed expression twisted something in his chest.

All he'd wanted was to teach that man a lesson for hurting his mother.

At precisely seven o'clock, Zoe Montgomery received a text notification.

(Meet me tonight at 10 at the Oceanview Grand Hotel, Room V809. I want to get to know you better. Dominic.

Was Dominic Blackwood really inviting her to a hotel room at night?!

The implications were impossible to ignore.

They were both consenting adults.

Even someone inexperienced in romance would understand the subtext of such an invitation.

Why this sudden change in Dominic's behavior toward her?

Zoe didn't dwell on the reasons - her mind was already spinning with giddy anticipation.

She needed the perfect outfit tonight, something unforgettable that would cement her place in his heart.

She was determined to completely replace Evelyn Thorne in Dominic's affections.

Meanwhile at Mooncrest Manor, Henry and Lily had finished their bedtime routine.

Lily suddenly produced a chocolate bar from beneath her pillow. "Grandma asked me to give this to you, Henry. She was worried you'd be hungry... Quick, eat it!"

Henry shook his head in refusal.

Undeterred, Lily dug under her pillow again.

Moments later, she triumphantly produced another identical chocolate bar.

"Mommy sent this one too. She's also worried about you being hungry. Please just eat one, Henry! We can share - one for each of us. Okay?" Lily pleaded with big, round eyes.

"Did Mommy really say that?" Henry studied the chocolates in his sister's small hands.

They were clearly from the same batch.

"Yes! Actually, both are from Mommy. She told me to pretend one was from Grandma first because she felt embarrassed..."

A rare warmth softened Henry's usually serious expression. Meanwhile, as the clock struck ten, a stunning figure appeared at the entrance of the Oceanview Grand Hotel.
###Chapter 212

Zoe had chosen a daring crimson gown for her evening at the hotel. Her fingers trembled slightly as she pushed open the door to Room V809.

Darkness enveloped the space, but her eyes quickly adjusted to the flickering glow of scarlet candles scattered throughout.

Scarlet candles!

Her gaze swept over the intimate setup—a crystal decanter of burgundy wine, delicate pastries arranged on silver trays, and beside them, an extravagant bouquet of blood-red roses.

The air was thick with romance, making her knees weak.

Dominic had never shown this side before.

Anticipation curled in her stomach like a coiled spring.

Lifting the roses to her face, she inhaled deeply, the heady floral scent making her dizzy with desire.

She set them down carefully before checking her phone.

Nearly ten o'clock. Where was he?

Had traffic delayed him?

Fifteen more minutes crawled by with no sign of Dominic. A knot of unease twisted in her chest.

Was this some cruel joke?

He wouldn’t have gone through all this trouble just to stand her up, would he?

Or worse—had the text been meant for someone else?

Pouring herself a generous glass, she swirled the rich liquid before taking a slow sip.

Exquisite.

The wine was bold, intoxicating, just like the man she was waiting for.

By eleven, the door finally clicked open. A tall silhouette filled the doorway.

Her pulse skyrocketed.

In a heartbeat, she was across the room, arms wrapping around his broad frame. "I knew you'd come," she murmured against his chest, voice thick with wine and want. "The wait was agony, but you're here now..."

The man went rigid beneath her touch.

She didn’t notice, too lost in the moment to care.

Two glasses had erased all hesitation.

All she craved was him.

Dawn arrived with a brutal headache.

Blinking against the harsh morning light, Zoe took in the unfamiliar room as memories of the night before flooded back.

A slow, satisfied smile curved her lips.

Last night had changed everything between her and Dominic.

She’d never imagined things would escalate so quickly—or that he’d be so breathtakingly skilled.

Every touch had been deliberate, every whisper against her skin a promise. He’d shown her pleasures she’d only dreamed of.

Now, she was utterly, irrevocably his.

Turning her head, she studied the man beside her.

His back was to her, pale skin marred by faint scratches—marks she’d left in the heat of passion.

A possessive thrill shot through her.

She shifted closer, letting her bare leg brush against his.

"Hmm? Ready for round two?"

The deep, unfamiliar voice froze her blood.

That wasn’t Dominic.

###Chapter 213 
Zoe Montgomery's entire frame froze as an icy chill raced down her spine.

Julian Whitmore turned to face her, his lips curling into a teasing smirk. "I had no idea you were so... vigorous in bed, Dr. Montgomery. You nearly drained me completely..."

Zoe finally focused on Julian's features clearly.

This wasn't their first encounter.

When she'd burned her hand months ago, Julian had been the one driving Eleanor Blackwood to visit her.

Between the alcohol haze from last night and the dim candlelight, she'd mistaken him for Dominic!

How could this have happened?

Dominic Blackwood had been the one to invite her here last night!

What was Julian doing in his place?!

"How did you get here? Why you?!" Zoe grabbed a pillow and began battering Julian's face repeatedly.

Julian shielded his head, protesting, "Dr. Montgomery! Stop! I'm just as confused! I received a text from Evelyn Thorne last night telling me to come to Room V809! The moment I entered, you practically attacked me... I tried to pull away several times but you clung tighter... Then you started undressing me! What man could resist that?!"

Zoe hurled the pillow to the floor before bursting into tears.

"Please don't cry! I know this situation reeks of conspiracy, but I'm telling the truth! I can show you the message! I wasn't trying to trick you intentionally! Let's just treat last night as a bad dream! I swear I won't tell my uncle - he'd skin me alive if he found out. I'm not suicidal!"

Julian dropped to his knees before Zoe, making frantic promises.

Through tear-blurred vision, Zoe thrust out her hand. "Show me the damn text!"

She needed to understand how this nightmare unfolded.

Julian scrambled for his phone, but after frantic scrolling, his face paled. "What the...? It's gone! The message from last night disappeared! I know I didn't delete it!"

Zoe seized another pillow and smashed it over Julian's head.

Julian looked utterly devastated.

"Wait! Let me explain! My phone was hacked recently! This must be the hacker's doing!"

"So you're claiming some hacker impersonated Evelyn Thorne to lure you here? And that same hacker sent me a message pretending to be your uncle?!" Zoe scoffed bitterly.

She refused to believe Dominic's message had been fake.

Yet... why hadn't he shown up?

Taking a shuddering breath, Zoe grabbed her phone and checked her messages.

Her blood ran cold.

"Your uncle's message is gone too? Looks like you got hacked as well!" Julian's eyes widened with realization. "Last night was an elaborate trap set for both of us!"

"Who would do this?! Who could possibly—"

Zoe felt hysteria rising.

If Dominic discovered she'd slept with his nephew, he'd never look at her again!

"I don't know... This hacker's too skilled. I can't trace anything," Julian admitted, handing her tissues. "But it definitely wasn't my uncle. He still needs you to treat Sophia. He wouldn't sabotage you like this."

Zoe dabbed at her eyes roughly. "Are there surveillance cameras here? Could our... activities have been recorded?"

Julian scanned the luxurious suite. "This is the Oceanview Grand... They wouldn't... Right? I'll sue them into oblivion if they did!"

"Get someone to sweep this room for cameras immediately!" Zoe commanded.

"Y-yes, right away," Julian stammered.

Meanwhile, Dominic Blackwood personally escorted Sophia to Willowbrook Academy that morning.

After seeing her to class, he headed toward Henry Thorne's classroom.

Following yesterday's meeting with Evelyn, Dominic and Lucas Grant had concluded the hacker targeting both Willowbrook Academy and Blackwood Group had to be someone close to Evelyn.

Someone she deeply cared about.

Why else would she have treated them to lunch?

The list of suspects narrowed down to Clara Thorne and the children.

Dominic had once seen Henry with a laptop.

While common sense said a four-year-old couldn't possibly be the hacker challenging him, sometimes the impossible proved true.

Dominic entered the classroom and approached the small boy in a baseball cap. "Henry Thorne, hand me your backpack."

###Chapter 214

Henry pretended not to hear Dominic and ignored him.

The teacher gasped at Henry's boldness, then hurried over. "Mr. Blackwood," she said carefully, "may I ask why you need Henry's bag?"

She was caught between two forces she couldn’t afford to cross.

After a tense moment of deliberation, she decided that angering Dominic Blackwood would be far worse. She reached for Henry’s backpack on the desk.

"Don’t worry, Henry," she said with a forced smile. "Mr. Blackwood isn’t trying to scare you. He’s just concerned." She handed the bag to Dominic. "He was cleared at security this morning. There’s nothing dangerous inside."

Dominic took the bag, his expression unreadable. "I recall he had a laptop with him."

The bag was suspiciously light. His brows lifted in surprise.

When he unzipped it, he found only a spare set of clothes—no laptop in sight.

The teacher shifted nervously. "Oh, Henry does have a small laptop. He likes watching cartoons on it."

Dominic dropped the bag back onto Henry’s desk and loomed over him. "Why didn’t you bring it today?"

Henry rested his head on the desk and closed his eyes, feigning sleep.

The teacher forced a laugh. "Should I call his mother?"

Henry shot up instantly, his dark eyes blazing as he glared at her. Without a word, he snatched his bag and stormed out of the classroom.

"Henry, wait!" The teacher rushed after him. "I won’t call her, I promise!"

But Henry didn’t look back.

Sophia stood by the door, watching as Henry marched past. "Henry," she called softly.

He barely spared her a glance before quickening his pace.

Dominic caught Sophia’s wrist as she tried to follow. "Where do you think you’re going?"

"Henry!" Sophia pointed after him, her face pinched with worry. "Where is he going?"

"His teacher will handle it," Dominic said firmly. "Let’s go back to your classroom."

But the moment he loosened his grip, Sophia wrenched free and sprinted after Henry.

"Wait for me, Henry!"

Dominic frowned.

Why was she so attached to him?

What had happened between them?

With a frustrated sigh, he followed.

Henry managed to slip past the school gates, the teacher and Dominic hot on his heels.

If he were alone, he would’ve hailed a cab and gone straight home.

But with three people chasing him, that wasn’t an option.

So he walked.

Dominic held Sophia’s hand as they trailed behind Henry, while the teacher kept pace on the opposite side of the street. The odd procession moved aimlessly through the city.

"Henry," the teacher called, breathless, "let me take you home."

"I don’t want to!" Henry snapped.

"Then where do you want to go?" she pressed. "It’s not safe for you to wander alone."

Henry scowled but didn’t answer.

Half an hour later, they reached a bustling street.

Sophia’s eyes widened as she took in the sights—her first real glimpse of the outside world.

Dominic watched her closely, noting how she absorbed everything with childlike wonder.

Zoe had said exposure to society would help her condition.

Before the last surgery, Sophia had refused to leave the house at all.

But now, she was curious.

It was progress.

The thought made Dominic’s mind drift to Zoe.

Maybe he should be nicer to her.

After all, she was the only one who could save Sophia.

Realizing they weren’t giving up, Henry stopped abruptly in the middle of the sidewalk.

Dominic took the opportunity to pull Sophia back. "Let’s go home. It’s too hot—you’ll get sick."

Sophia shook her head, her face flushed with heat. "Henry will get sick too."

Dominic’s frown deepened. "Why are you so fixated on him?" He crouched to her level. "Would you follow him if he went home?"
###Chapter 215

Evelyn watched as Henry gave a firm nod.

The boy had been to Dominic's estate before and clearly enjoyed it there.

His eagerness to return was evident in his bright eyes.

Dominic had noticed his laptop missing from school - a clear sign Evelyn had confiscated it.

The billionaire's suspicions were confirmed - this precocious child in the baseball cap was undoubtedly the elusive hacker.

Though Henry was Evelyn's adopted son, Dominic felt compelled to discipline him.

Yet Sophia's unexpected affection for the boy complicated matters.

A sudden crash shattered the moment, followed by a torrent of violent curses.

The group turned toward the commotion where two men were locked in a brutal fistfight.

Sophia's face went deathly pale as the scene triggered traumatic memories.

Her hands flew to her ears as bloodcurdling screams tore from her throat.

Dominic's chest constricted seeing his sister's distress - she was reliving their childhood abuse.

Scooping Sophia into his arms, he rushed away without a backward glance.

Henry stood frozen, the echo of Sophia's terrified cries haunting him.

Why had she reacted so strongly?

The fight hadn't involved her directly - what trauma lay beneath her reaction?

"This is too dangerous, Henry! We're returning to campus immediately!"

His teacher grabbed his arm and hurried him away from the chaotic scene.

That afternoon found Evelyn at the Eldermere Police Department.

Five years ago, Margaret Thorne's brother James Worthington had embezzled nearly three hundred million from Thornfield Industries before fleeing overseas.

Despite ironclad evidence, local authorities had been powerless - the country he'd escaped to had no extradition treaty with Eldermere.

Worthington had even assumed a new identity abroad.

Evelyn had spent years tracking him through private investigators.

Recent intel finally provided current photos and his exact address.

She'd handed everything over to the police.

Today brought a breakthrough.

"Miss Thorne, we've sent Worthington's old associates to persuade his return," Officer Bradford explained. "Our sources indicate he's nearly bankrupted the stolen funds."

"I don't care about the money - I want justice. My attorneys confirm the amount qualifies for capital punishment, correct?"

"Indeed. We'll arrest him immediately upon re-entry."

"Excellent work, Officer."

Exiting the station, Evelyn breathed deeply - rebuilding Thornfield Industries had been part of her plan to lure him back.

She wanted Worthington to see her newfound wealth firsthand.

A man who stole once would surely try again.

She'd instructed Thornfield's CFO to contact Worthington's circle, planting the illusion of another theft opportunity.

The trap was set.

As Evelyn started her car, her phone rang.

Seeing Wesley's name, she answered immediately. "You're at the airport?"

"Yes. Where are you? I can meet you," Wesley replied.

"I'll come get you."

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn pulled up at Ravenshore International Airport.

After getting Wesley's address, she merged onto the highway.

"How long are you staying this time?" she asked.

"Permanently," he said with a casual shrug. "I resigned to come home."

"That's wonderful! We'll see each other more often," Evelyn said with genuine warmth.

But Wesley's expression darkened.

"Zoe Montgomery contacted me, Evelyn. She's more brazen than I imagined. You should be careful around her."
###Chapter 216

"What did she want from you?" Evelyn inquired sharply, her fingers tightening around her coffee cup.

Wesley's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "She claims she needs an assistant and asked me to recommend one." He let out a dry chuckle. "You'll love her requirements - someone who studied under Professor Whitmore, with skills equal to or better than hers." His eyes rolled dramatically. "Might as well admit she wants someone to handle Sophia's case for her. As if any qualified professional would agree to be her assistant! The woman's either delusional or just plain stupid."

Evelyn couldn't help but mirror his cynical expression. The audacity was almost impressive.

"She's clearly out of her depth, yet she refuses to back down." Wesley shook his head. "Dominic Blackwood isn't a fool. The truth will come out eventually." He gave Evelyn a pointed look. "You're too forgiving. Most women wouldn't show such kindness to their romantic rival."

"As long as you're comfortable with the situation," Evelyn deflected.

"Punishing myself over this serves no purpose. We need to focus on the future," she continued, deliberately changing the subject. "Good news - Thornfield Industries is nearly rebuilt. Everything's progressing smoothly."

Wesley's face brightened. "That's excellent. How's Henry adjusting at Willowbrook Academy?"

Evelyn's smile vanished at the mention of her son. "He's picked up hacking from Mike. His skills are... concerningly advanced." She massaged her temples. "Dominic's taken notice. If this continues, he might uncover more than I want him to."

"Secrets rarely stay buried forever, Evelyn," Wesley said gently. "You're not the same woman you were four years ago. Even if he discovers he's their father, he wouldn't harm them."

"Exactly why I need more power and resources," Evelyn countered sharply. "That's the only way to guarantee their safety. I'll keep this secret as long as possible." Her voice turned bitter. "Given the chaos of his personal life, my children are better off without him."

Meanwhile, Dominic had brought Sophia back to Mooncrest Manor. The family physician administered a sedative.

Once Sophia slept peacefully, the doctor turned to Dominic. "Mental health issues are beyond my expertise. I strongly recommend consulting a psychiatrist."

Dominic had considered this before. "She's wary of strangers."

"It's worth attempting," the doctor pressed. "You mentioned her condition improved post-surgery? Addressing emotional trauma could accelerate her overall recovery."

Dominic gave a terse nod. "Do you have any recommendations?"

"There's a renowned psychiatrist I know, though availability may be an issue. I'll inquire." The doctor hesitated. "You might also consult Dr. Montgomery. Her perspective would be more specialized."

Dominic's acknowledgment was curt.

Zoe arrived thirty minutes later, dressed unusually conservatively in long sleeves and pants, her face heavily made up.

"Are you well, Dr. Montgomery?" Dominic studied her appearance with concern. "I heard you were out all night."

Zoe had deliberately evaded her security detail, leaving them unaware of her whereabouts.

"An old friend visited unexpectedly," she lied smoothly, quickly redirecting. "Has Sophia had another episode?"

Dominic recounted the afternoon's events.

"Has she experienced similar trauma before?" Zoe asked professionally. "Post-brain surgery patients need calm environments free of triggers. Rest is crucial."

"Would psychiatric intervention help?"

"We could trial it with an expert," Zoe conceded carefully. "But we must respect Sophia's boundaries. If she resists, we shouldn't force it. As her cognitive functions improve, so will her emotional resilience."

"Return to your work, Dominic. I'll monitor Sophia," Zoe offered.

As Dominic retreated to his study, Zoe exhaled in quiet relief. Julian's men had swept the Oceanview Grand Hotel room that morning - no hidden cameras found. For now, last night's indiscretion remained secret.

Whoever set the trap lacked concrete evidence. Without proof, she could deny everything.
###Chapter 217

Zoe Montgomery had set her sights on Dominic Blackwood as her ticket to the upper echelons of society.

Being a skilled doctor was no longer her priority—she craved the prestige and power that came with being at the top.

She knew her limitations. No matter how hard she worked, she would never reach the level of expertise of Professor Sebastian Whitmore.

The medical field could only take her so far.

But marrying Dominic? That would change everything.

She would become the woman everyone envied.

Dominic had barely settled into his study when Lucas Grant called.

"Hey, Dominic. How did things go at the school?"

"The kid didn’t bring his laptop today. I’m guessing Evelyn took it away from him."

"So it really was Evelyn’s son? He’s only four, right? Some kind of prodigy?" Lucas sounded fascinated.

Dominic didn’t respond.

"What are you planning to do with the kid?" Lucas pressed.

The whole situation amused him.

It would’ve been dull if the hacker had turned out to be some random adult.

Who would’ve thought the person who crippled Blackwood Group’s entire network was a four-year-old?

"And why did he challenge you to strangle him?" Lucas continued, laughing. "Why don’t you ask him yourself if you’re so curious? He ignores me," Dominic muttered.

"Hahaha! This kid’s got attitude! I have to meet him."

"Not happening."

What Henry had done was wrong, but he was… special.

Dominic wouldn’t punish him, and he certainly wouldn’t let Lucas harass him at school.

"Evelyn’s birthday is coming up. What if they invite us to the party? Then I’d get to see the kid," Lucas suggested eagerly. "You should get her a gift in advance. Sure, you’re divorced, but you two had history. You’re not going to be petty and ignore her birthday, right?"

Dominic’s sharp eyes narrowed. "Do you really think she’d accept anything from me?"

"She was civil enough at lunch yesterday. Even if it was just because we had leverage."

"There’s no point—"

"Come on, how expensive could a gift be? If you’re too proud, I’ll give it to her myself. I really want to meet that kid," Lucas insisted.

After a brief silence, Dominic relented. "Fine. What would be appropriate?"

"Jewelry. Women love that stuff."

"Jewelry is too personal. We’re divorced."

"Then what? You can’t give her something cheap—she’s a millionaire now."

Dominic pinched the bridge of his nose. "Fine. Jewelry it is."

Outside the study door, Zoe’s fingers clenched around her phone, her chest burning with jealousy.

For her birthday, Dominic had his assistant send a handbag worth a few thousand dollars.

Now? He was buying Evelyn expensive jewelry.

Who was his real girlfriend?

How could he do this to her?

She was the only one who could save Sophia now!

Her vision blurred with fury as she pulled out her phone and texted her father.

(Evelyn Thorne has two children. Find out where she adopted them in Bridgedale—and why.)

###Chapter 218

Dinner was served at Mooncrest Manor.

"Evelyn, Wesley stopped by to see you earlier," Clara said, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "He mentioned he's planning to settle down here in Eldermere..."

Evelyn didn’t need to hear the rest to know where her mother was going with this.

"Mom, I know you’re eager to see me married, but please don’t make that face in public," Evelyn groaned. "People will think I’m desperate! I’m only in my twenties—I have plenty of time. Right now, I should be focusing on my career. Once I’m successful, men will be lining up at my door."

Clara’s hopeful expression dimmed.

"I’m not pressuring you," she insisted. "I just think Wesley is a wonderful man. He looked after you the entire time you were abroad. Doesn’t that count for something?"

"Should I marry every man who’s nice to me? By that logic, I should’ve married Professor Whitmore too!"

"Fine! Keep pretending you don’t see what’s right in front of you!" Clara huffed. "Wesley is a rare catch. If you let him slip away, you might regret it."

"Have a little faith in me, Mom," Evelyn said, patting her mother’s hand. "Besides, have you asked the kids what they think? They’re not exactly thrilled about the idea of a stepfather."

She shot a pointed look at her children.

Lily, ever the diplomat, piped up, "I don’t want a stepfather, but I’ll be nice to anyone Mommy likes."

Evelyn sighed. Clearly, her daughter hadn’t picked up on the hint.

She turned her hopeful gaze to her son.

"Let’s eat, Grandma," Henry said simply.

Clara exhaled in defeat. "Fine, I’ll drop it. I just don’t want you to look back and regret this. But if you’re not interested, I won’t waste my breath."

Evelyn grinned. "If you’re so keen on matchmaking, why not set up Mike? He’s been drowning his sorrows at bars lately. I bet he’d love a partner."

Clara opened her mouth, then closed it, rendered speechless.

The next day at Thornfield Industries, Wesley’s unexpected visit caught Evelyn off guard.

"Aren’t you supposed to be recovering from jet lag?" she asked, gesturing for him to sit.

"Do you have coffee here?" he inquired.

"I do, but you shouldn’t have any now," she chided, pouring him a glass of water instead. "You’ll never sleep tonight. How about I give you a tour of the departments instead?"

Wesley nodded, then hesitated. "Actually, I came to discuss something with you."

He slid a photograph across the desk.

Evelyn picked it up, studying the face in the image. "Who’s this?"

"A patient," Wesley explained. "He’s been bedridden for three years, but he’s semi-conscious—better off than someone in a vegetative state. His parents reached out to Professor Whitmore six months ago. He took the case but didn’t have time to finalize a treatment plan before..."

Evelyn’s expression softened. "If the professor gave his word, send me the medical records. I’ll take a look."

"Are you sure? You just started your company. I don’t want to burden you."

"Send the records first," she insisted, tapping the photo. "It’s a shame for someone this handsome to be stuck in a hospital bed."

Wesley chuckled. "I’ll send them over later today. Now, show me your empire."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Don’t tease me. I wasn’t this smug when I visited St. Elizabeth Medical Center."

As they walked through the office, their laughter drew curious glances.

By the end of the day, whispers about Evelyn Thorne’s new boyfriend had spread like wildfire through Thornfield Industries.
###Chapter 219

That evening, Lucas handed Dominic a photo of Evelyn and Wesley together.

"Evelyn's new man."

Dominic glanced at the picture, his expression darkening instantly. "Isn't that Professor Whitmore's assistant?"

He snatched Lucas' phone and zoomed in, his jaw tightening.

"You know him?" Lucas asked, intrigued. "Rumors say Evelyn gave him a full tour of Thornfield Industries today. They were inseparable—laughing, chatting, looking awfully cozy."

Dominic tossed the phone back. "I know him."

Lucas smirked. "Honestly, they make a striking pair. Him with that scholarly charm, her with that effortless grace."

Dominic's icy glare could have frozen the room.

"Must you always provoke me?"

"Me? Provoke?" Lucas feigned innocence. "I'm just pointing out the obvious. That brooch you picked for Evelyn? Massive diamond, right over the heart. The jeweler joked it could stop a bullet."

Dominic's mood soured further.

"Is this a birthday gift or a guilt offering?" Lucas pressed. "Think she'll even accept something that extravagant?"

"Then forget it," Dominic snapped, pushing his plate away. His appetite was gone.

Lucas sighed. "Not what I meant. Nathan told me you gave Zoe a designer bag worth a few grand for her birthday. How’s she going to feel when she finds out you gifted Evelyn a diamond that could fund a small country?"

"Nathan chose it. I didn’t check the price."

"You approved it without looking?"

Dominic didn’t answer.

Lucas rolled his eyes. "If you’re not serious about Dr. Montgomery, end it. There’s got to be another specialist who can treat Sophia."

Dominic rubbed his temples. "That’s the problem. No one else has made progress with her. Zoe’s the only one who has."

If not for Sophia’s condition, Zoe’s threats would mean nothing.

"Wasn’t Evelyn also Professor Whitmore’s student?" Lucas asked.

"She was. But she left academia for Apex Innovations," Dominic said flatly. "She’s a CEO now."

Lucas shook his head. "Wouldn’t it be perfect if Evelyn could help Sophia?"

Dominic’s chest tightened.

Perfect? Nothing in his life had ever been perfect.

A week later, Zoe called Evelyn, demanding a meeting.

"No, thanks," Evelyn refused instantly.

She’d seen Zoe’s true colors—manipulative, ruthless. She wasn’t walking into that trap again.

Zoe’s laugh was cold. "Fine. Then let’s talk now. You claimed you adopted those children. But my people checked every orphanage in Ravenswood. No records. They’re yours, aren’t they? Your real children."
###Chapter 220

Evelyn's breath hitched as Zoe's words struck like a dagger.

"If I'm correct, those children belong to you and Dominic," Zoe purred, her voice dripping with venom through the phone.

A shiver raced down Evelyn's spine.

"Adoption records are sealed for a reason!" she snapped, her nails digging into her palms.

"Of course they are," Zoe laughed, the sound sharp and mocking. "But my father isn't just anyone. His connections in Ravenswood confirmed your little lie. And Dominic—oh, he despises children, doesn't he? Imagine his reaction when he learns the truth."

"Zoe Montgomery, you're crossing a line!" Evelyn hissed.

"Am I? Or are you?" Zoe's voice turned shrill. "Dominic is mine now. You're his ex-wife. Stay in your lane."

"Here's my offer—I'll keep your secret if you swear never to see him again."

Zoe's confidence was suffocating. She knew Evelyn's weakness.

Those children were her heart.

And Zoe expected her to crumble.

But Evelyn refused.

She had done nothing wrong. Why should she bow to this cruelty?

"Let's meet," Evelyn said, her voice steady. "Same restaurant as last time."

"Fine."

Thirty minutes later, they faced each other across the same table.

Evelyn smirked as she sat. "No hot water today, Miss Montgomery."

Zoe's cheeks flushed.

Without hesitation, Evelyn activated her phone's recorder and slid it between them. "Feel free to turn yours on too. Let's make sure we capture everything."

Zoe's lips parted in shock.

The audacity.

How could Evelyn act so boldly when she held all the power?

Evelyn flipped open the menu, ordered juice and dessert, then passed it to Zoe.

Zoe requested a drink and dismissed the waiter.

Once alone, she leaned forward. "Pathetic, really. Most women gain status by bearing a man's children. But you? You're just a cautionary tale."

Evelyn's smile didn't waver. "Funny. I don't measure my worth by a man's approval. My children are mine. I didn't have them for Dominic—or any man. Shocking, isn't it? For someone so educated, you think like a medieval broodmare."

Zoe's hands trembled, but she couldn't retaliate.

"So you're not afraid of Dominic finding out?" she sneered. "Good. Then he can meet his precious family sooner than expected."

Evelyn laughed. "Oh, Zoe. I only agreed to meet to watch your face twist while you threatened me. And look—you delivered."

Zoe's fingers twitched toward the table, but the memory of her burns stopped her.

Her eyes burned with unshed tears.

"Tell me," Evelyn mused, "how does it feel knowing you blackmailed Dominic into dating you with lies about Sophia's treatment?"

Zoe stiffened.

"Do you wake up in a cold sweat?" Evelyn tilted her head. "After all, you weren't the surgeon."

Zoe's face went deathly pale.
###Chapter 221

Evelyn's fingers trembled violently against her teacup.

"You! You—"

Her vision blurred as blood drained from her face, leaving her pale as chalk.

"I happened to be at St. Elizabeth Medical Center that day," Evelyn stated icily, watching Zoe's panic unfold. "If you're foolish enough to blackmail me, you'd better be prepared to face the consequences when Dominic casts you aside!"

The waiter arrived just then with their order.

Evelyn calmly stirred her tea, the silver spoon clinking against fine china.

"I never imagined you'd be this cunning, Evelyn Thorne!"

Zoe's triumphant smirk had vanished, replaced by sheer desperation.

"Truce! Let's forget this ever happened!" Zoe hissed. "Your secret stays with me if mine stays with you!"

"Wasn't it you who came here boasting?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "One scrap of information and you strutted in here like some medical genius. With that arrogance, you'll never cure Sophia—not in ten years, not ever."

"Don't you dare question my credentials!" Zoe's nails dug into the tablecloth. "Professor Whitmore always said business-minded traitors like you were the worst kind!"

Evelyn took a slow sip of her iced tea.

The citrus tang grounded her.

"Aren't you the least bit curious about Sophia's real surgeon?" Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "Did you truly believe your pathetic lie would hold forever?"

"Of course I've investigated!" Zoe snapped. "You're withholding information because you're jealous of my relationship with Dominic—"

"Spare me the theatrics." Evelyn's laugh was razor-sharp. "If I wanted Dominic back, one phone call would end your little romance."

"How dare you—"

"Unpleasant, isn't it?" Evelyn cut her off. "Being threatened? Remember this feeling next time you consider blackmail."

She delicately sliced into her lemon tart before continuing, "The surgeon was a middle-aged man. Stocky build, military haircut, about five-seven..."

Zoe's breath hitched.

"Why help me now?"

"Because I never want to see your face again," Evelyn said flatly. "Consider this your final warning. Don't contact me."

"Fine!" Zoe grabbed her purse. "But mark my words—I'll find him before you do!"

Seven days before Evelyn's birthday, Lucas stormed into Dominic's office.

"Did you get an invitation to Evelyn's birthday gala?"

Dominic's pen stilled. "No."

"Neither did I," Lucas huffed. "If you're not invited, there's no way I would be. Maybe she's not even celebrating this year."

"Possible."

Evelyn had always disliked attention.

"You already bought that necklace," Lucas pressed. "Should I call Thornfield Industries to confirm?"

"Do what you want." Dominic's tone was carefully neutral. "Don't bother reporting back."

Ten minutes later, Lucas returned, face flushed.

"Dominic! She's booked the Grand Ballroom at The Celestial! Five hundred guests confirmed!" Lucas sputtered. "And we're not on the list!"

The pain was sudden and visceral.

To Evelyn, he meant less than nothing now.

"She has her reasons." Dominic's voice betrayed nothing. "Don't you have work to do?"

Lucas fled.

Silence swallowed the office.

Dominic lasted thirty minutes before calling The Celestial Hotel himself.

###Chapter 222

Since Evelyn reserved the grandest ballroom at the Oceanview Grand Hotel, Dominic immediately booked the adjacent smaller venue.

He needed to witness firsthand the scale of Evelyn's birthday celebration.

That weekend, all invited guests gathered in the majestic Astor Hall of the luxury hotel.

"Where's Evelyn?" Sophie asked Adrian the moment she entered. "She hasn't even responded to my message from last night."

Adrian shrugged. "She's been preoccupied lately. I sent her the details though - she promised she'd come."

"But isn't Thornfield Industries keeping her busy?" Sophie pressed.

"Not that I know of." Adrian crossed his arms. "Everyone deserves privacy. Even if we're close as siblings, I respect her boundaries."

Sophie arched an eyebrow. "If she's been so busy, who organized this whole event?"

"Yours truly," Adrian declared proudly.

"And the guest list?"

"That too!"

Sophie snorted before slipping into the neighboring Celestial Hall.

The intimate space contrasted sharply with the sprawling Astor Hall.

Thanks to Adrian's meddling, Dominic's inner circle now occupied Celestial Hall.

Sophie immediately claimed the seat beside Lucas.

"Where's Dominic?" She grabbed Lucas's wine glass. "I thought he'd be fuming about not getting an invitation?"

"Traffic delay," Lucas replied, watching her drain his drink. "Evelyn's not here either?"

"Adrian says she's been mysteriously busy." Sophie licked her lips. "He planned everything - no wonder you weren't invited."

When Wesley arrived, the scene stunned him.

Adrian was taking punches from two men - one being Evelyn's ex-husband Dominic Blackwood.

Wesley yanked Adrian away. "What the hell, Dominic?"

The CEO had arrived moments earlier.

Finding Adrian pummeling Nathan had triggered his violent response.

Now it was two against one.

"He attacked my assistant," Dominic said calmly, straightening his cuffs. "Nathan's not built for fistfights."
###Chapter 223

Dominic Blackwood spotted the commotion as he exited the grand hall.

His pulse quickened when he realized the situation was far more complicated than it appeared.

Moonlight cast long shadows as two men pummeled Lucas Grant mercilessly - one of them being Evelyn Thorne's ex-husband.

Wesley Ashford swiftly pulled Lucas to safety, then confronted Dominic. "What's the meaning of this?"

Dominic had arrived mere moments earlier.

Seeing Lucas pinning Nathan Cross to the ground had ignited his fury, prompting him to lash out without hesitation.

The fight had escalated into an uneven brawl within seconds.

"He was assaulting my assistant, Mr. Ashford," Dominic explained, straightening his suit jacket. "Nathan isn't built for physical confrontations."

Wesley noticed Nathan's shattered glasses before turning a disapproving glare toward Lucas.

"Evelyn's phone is switched off. We don't know if she's in trouble," Wesley said urgently. "I'm going to search for her now. You can either return to the event or join me."

Lucas clenched his jaw, suppressing his anger. "I'm coming with you!"

Dominic intercepted them with long strides, blocking their path.

"What happened to Evelyn?!"

"Mr. Blackwood, we're as much in the dark as you are," Wesley replied. "When I spoke with her this morning, she confirmed she'd arrive by six. It's nearly seven now with no sign of her."

"It's the weekend. Shouldn't she be at home?" Dominic's eyes darkened with concern.

"She isn't. We're leaving to search for her now. Any further questions can wait until we find her," Wesley stated before rushing off with Lucas.

Dominic watched their retreating figures before heading toward a different elevator.

Nathan hurried after him, explaining, "Sir, Lucas organized Miss Thorne's event. He handled the guest list. Excluding you wasn't her decision."

Dominic's brow furrowed. "Didn't she review the invitations personally?"
"I heard she's been preoccupied with other matters," Nathan offered.

Dominic gave him a measured look. "Don't follow me. Get yourself new glasses."

"Yes, sir."

"Use your intellect, not your fists, especially against physically superior opponents. You're usually more composed - what possessed you tonight?" Dominic studied Nathan's flushed face.

Nathan lowered his gaze. "I believe my past conflict with him influenced the guest list."

"You're overestimating your impact. He wouldn't have invited me regardless," Dominic said coolly. "Exercise better judgment next time."

"Yes, sir."

Exiting the building, Dominic slid into his luxury sedan.

"Destination, sir?" his bodyguard inquired.

"First, I need to make a call."

Dominic contacted the telecommunications company, requesting the last known location of Evelyn's phone before it powered off.

Within minutes, he received coordinates.

"Take me to Mooncrest Manor."

The signal had last pinged near that affluent neighborhood.

As they approached the area, Dominic instructed his driver to reduce speed.

Amidst the bustling streets, his sharp eyes caught a white luxury sedan parked haphazardly by the roadside.

It resembled Evelyn's vehicle!

"Stop the car!" Dominic commanded, causing the vehicle to screech to a halt.

He burst from the car and sprinted toward the motionless vehicle.

The crisp autumn wind carried an unexpected chill. When he reached the car, his blood ran cold at the sight of Evelyn collapsed over the steering wheel, frighteningly still.

Dominic's chest constricted painfully.

"Evelyn!"

His voice cracked with desperation as he violently wrenched at the stubborn door handle, his vision tinged red with panic.
###Chapter 224

Evelyn's car doors were locked!

Only a thin sheet of glass separated them, leaving Dominic powerless to reach her.

His bodyguard sprinted forward with an emergency hammer, shattering the windshield in one swift motion before climbing inside.

Once in, the bodyguard swiftly unlocked the doors.

Dominic yanked open the driver’s side door and pulled Evelyn into his arms.

She bore no visible wounds, but her breathing was faint—too faint.

Her state resembled a deep, unnatural slumber.

Otherwise, the violent shattering of glass would have jolted her awake instantly.

At St. Elizabeth Medical Center, after a full examination, the doctor announced, "She fainted due to oxygen deprivation. Fortunately, you brought her in time—she’s not in critical condition. Rest is all she needs. She’ll recover upon waking."

Dominic’s jaw tightened. "How did she end up deprived of oxygen? Did the tests reveal anything abnormal?"

The doctor scanned the report before handing it over. "Her vitals are stable. Aside from slightly low blood sugar, nothing stands out."

Dominic’s gaze darkened as he studied Evelyn’s pale face. "Then why hasn’t she woken? When will she? Are you certain hospitalization isn’t necessary?"

No external injuries, yet she’d collapsed inside a locked car.

Something wasn’t adding up.

"Exhaustion, Mr. Blackwood," the doctor explained patiently. "Her body is demanding rest—hence the deep sleep." He lifted Evelyn’s eyelid gently, revealing bloodshot veins. "See the dark circles? The redness? Her system is overworked."

Dominic’s grip on the report tightened.

So she’d been pushing herself to the brink.

Had she dozed off while driving, then succumbed completely at the wheel?

What could possibly have drained her so thoroughly?

If he’d arrived even minutes later—

He shoved the thought away.

An hour later, Dominic carried Evelyn into Blackwood Manor, then called Clara.

"Why is my daughter at your house?!" Clara’s voice spiked with alarm.

"The doctor advised rest, not hospitalization," Dominic replied evenly. "She’s safe here."

"You know our address. Why not bring her home?!"

Clara’s fingers clenched around her phone. She couldn’t risk bringing Lily and Henry to his estate. Not with the past between them.

"You’d understand if you saw her condition," Dominic countered, deliberately vague.

A beat of silence. Then—

"What aren’t you telling me? What happened to Evelyn?!"

"For now, she’s stable. Asleep. She’ll return once she wakes." A pause. "If you’re uneasy, come with the children. My doors are open."

"...I’ll send Wesley."

Another hour passed before Wesley Ashford arrived.

"You’re saying she passed out in a locked car?" Wesley’s disbelief was palpable. "While driving?"

Dominic’s icy stare pinned him. "What exactly is your relationship with Evelyn, Mr. Ashford?"

###Chapter 225 "We're friends," Wesley replied smoothly.

Dominic's piercing gaze never wavered. "Professor Whitmore had dozens of female students. You're not this chummy with Zoe Montgomery, are you?" His voice dripped with sarcasm. "Tell me, Ashford, do you have feelings for Evelyn?"

The air between them crackled with tension.

Wesley felt the weight of Dominic's suspicion pressing against him. "Isn't Evelyn entitled to move on?" He offered a placating smile. "Mr. Blackwood, has Evelyn ever commented on your... arrangement with Miss Montgomery?"

Dominic's expression turned glacial. "Here's what puzzles me. When I asked for help identifying the student Professor Whitmore mentioned before his death, you gave me an entire roster. Why omit Zoe? She claims to know you. Surely the connection isn't coincidental?"

Wesley's fingers twitched against his water glass. The man was sharper than anticipated.

"Naturally I know her. But she graduated years ago - I couldn't possibly vouch for her current skillset. The list allowed you to evaluate each candidate objectively."

Dominic's smirk held no warmth. "Did the professor never speak of her? He refused to operate on Sophia himself, yet claimed one of his students could. That suggests extraordinary talent. You expect me to believe such a prodigy never came up in conversation?"

Wesley's throat went dry. He reached for his water, buying precious seconds.

"You're hiding something, Ashford." Dominic leaned forward, eyes like polished obsidian. "Is this deception for Evelyn's benefit?"

"This has nothing to do with Evelyn," Wesley countered. "Professor Whitmore kept many confidences. Your case being one of them - I knew nothing until recently. Even if I admired Miss Montgomery's work, I'd never presume to make medical recommendations."

The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken accusations.

Finally, Wesley exhaled sharply. "Even if I cared for Evelyn, I'd never act on it. She sees me as nothing more than an older brother."

Like ice melting, the tension in Dominic's shoulders eased. "Good. You may leave. Evelyn will contact you when she wakes."

Once alone, Dominic moved toward the master suite. The door stood ajar, revealing Sophia hovering near the bed, studying Evelyn's sleeping form with childlike fascination.

"Do you like her?" Dominic murmured, coming to stand beside his sister.

Sophia typically shied from strangers - even Zoe had taken weeks to earn her trust. Yet here she stood, drawn to Evelyn without prompting.

"Yes!" Sophia's whisper carried the memory of gentle hands cooling her fevered brow months prior. "Very much."

Dominic's gaze flickered between the two women. "Because she's beautiful?"

"More beautiful than Dr. Montgomery." Small fingers curled around Dominic's. "Don't you think so?"

A humorless chuckle escaped him. "You're absolutely right."

Sophia tilted her head, confusion knitting her brow. "Then why aren't you with her?"

The question struck like a physical blow. Sophia's progress since her last surgery had been remarkable - soon she might live normally. But until they secured long-term treatment, Zoe remained necessary.

"That's complicated, sweetheart." He smoothed her hair, swallowing the bitterness. "Just focus on being happy."

"But you're not happy." Sophia touched his cheek with startling perceptiveness. "I can tell."

Nearby, Evelyn stirred at the murmured voices. Consciousness hovered just beyond reach as she struggled to surface.
###Chapter 226

After what felt like an eternity of struggling, Evelyn's heavy eyelids refused to open.

Dominic's deep voice reached her ears, but who was that woman speaking to him?

The feminine voice was completely unfamiliar... Addressing him as "Big Brother."

Was Dominic actually flirting with another woman right now?

Unbelievable!

Here she was, unconscious in bed, while he entertained some woman at her bedside.

The audacity!

If she could just wake up this instant, she'd throw them both out of the room immediately!

Fuming in her half-conscious state, Evelyn felt her chest tighten with anger.

Exhaustion eventually won, pulling her back into deep slumber.

Dominic gently guided Sophia's hand, leading her back to her own room to rest.

Once his sister was settled, Dominic returned to the master bedroom.

Evelyn had shifted positions, her peaceful breathing indicating deep sleep.

Dominic stepped into the ensuite bathroom, turning on the shower.

When Zoe received word that Dominic had brought Evelyn home to spend the night, her vision blurred with rage.

Just who did he consider his girlfriend now?

She knew perfectly well Dominic only agreed to date her because of her ability to treat Sophia's condition.

But that didn't mean he could publicly humiliate her like this!

Bringing Evelyn home overnight? What was this if not blatant infidelity?

The shame she'd felt after accidentally sleeping with Julian suddenly seemed insignificant.

She bitterly realized Dominic probably wouldn't care even if he found out about her night with Julian.

Grabbing a bottle of red wine, Zoe stormed back to her guest room.

Wesley arrived at the Blackwood estate at dawn to check on Evelyn's condition.

Dominic appeared in casual loungewear, his expression darkening at the unexpected visitor.

"Clara sent me, Mr. Blackwood. She's concerned Evelyn hasn't returned home," Wesley explained.

He knew showing up unannounced at this hour was improper, but he couldn't refuse Clara's request.

Dominic reluctantly led Wesley to the bedroom.

Wesley had been genuinely worried about Evelyn's wellbeing.

But seeing her sprawled across the entire king-sized bed, leaving no space for Dominic, his concerns eased.

"My apologies for the intrusion, Mr. Blackwood," Wesley said before quietly exiting.

Dominic retreated to the adjacent guest suite for more rest.

It was barely seven in the morning!

Having only fallen asleep around two, his mood was particularly foul.

Once outside the Blackwood gates, Wesley immediately called Clara.

"Evelyn's still sleeping soundly. Dominic Blackwood is resting in another room," he reported. "No need to worry. She's perfectly safe. I'm certain she'll return once she wakes."

Clara exhaled in relief. "Thank you, Wesley. With the children, I couldn't just go over there myself."

"I'll check again if she's not back by noon," Wesley offered.

"That would be wonderful! Thank you so much."

"Don't mention it. I feel partially responsible for Evelyn's condition," Wesley admitted regretfully. "She wouldn't be this exhausted if I hadn't assigned her that new case."

"Please don't say that. Evelyn wouldn't have progressed so quickly without Professor Whitmore's guidance. Healing people is her calling. The work may be demanding, but you're not to blame."

The phone call lifted Clara's spirits. "I'm going to the market, Henry. Watch your sister until I return, alright?" she told her grandson.

Henry gave a solemn nod.

The moment Clara stepped out, the children sprang into action.

Lily grabbed her small backpack while Henry retrieved his laptop from Evelyn's room.

"We should tell Grandma, Henry! She'll worry otherwise," Lily insisted, tugging her brother's sleeve with wide, earnest eyes.

###Chapter 227

Dominic's expression darkened as he spoke in a low voice. "Grandma won't let us go find Mommy if she finds out."

Lily puffed out her cheeks, her small face scrunched in conflict. "Fine... Then let's just go ourselves! What if Mean Daddy is being horrible to her again?"

Henry pressed his lips together, weighing the options in his mind before making a decision.

"I'll go alone. You stay here. If Grandma asks, make something up," he said firmly, then slipped out of the house before she could protest.

As the door clicked shut behind him, Lily's long lashes fluttered, hot tears spilling down her cheeks.

How could she let Henry face Mean Daddy all by himself?

What if he got hurt?

She couldn’t lose her big brother!

Panicked, she sprinted to Lucas’s room, her tiny feet pounding against the floor.

She flung the door open, rushed to the messy bed, and yanked at his arm, sobbing. "Wake up, Uncle Lucas! Henry left! He went alone... He didn’t take me!"

Meanwhile, at the Blackwood mansion, a servant stepped out of the kitchen, frowning. "Why is the power out?"

Mrs. Wilkins sighed. "There was no outage notice. I’ll switch on the backup generator."

The lights flickered back to life—but only for ten minutes before darkness swallowed the house again.

Dominic descended the stairs just as Mrs. Wilkins hurried toward him. "Sir, the power is out again. The backup generator failed too. I’ve called for repairs, but the utility company says there’s no outage in the area."

His expression remained unreadable.

He strode toward the front door, where a bodyguard intercepted him.

"Sir, this power outage is suspicious. I’ve doubled security."

Dominic gave a curt nod and continued toward the gates.

The bodyguard hesitated but followed.

At the gates, Dominic’s sharp gaze landed on a small figure lurking in the shadows. He pointed. "Bring him to me."

The bodyguard squinted. "That little boy, sir?"

Before they could move, Henry stepped forward on his own, his small frame defiant.

The bodyguard stiffened in surprise.

Dominic’s cold stare never wavered.

Henry had changed clothes and wore a cap that obscured most of his face, but Dominic recognized him instantly.

There was no doubt—Henry was behind the blackout.

If his plan had worked, he would’ve hacked into the mansion’s entire network by now.

He was here for Evelyn.

Henry marched past them, deliberately stomping on Dominic’s polished shoe as he passed.

Dominic didn’t flinch.

The bodyguard gasped, dropping to his knees to brush off the scuff. "That little brat! No manners at all—probably some street orphan! Let me throw him out, sir."

Dominic’s voice was glacial. "You’re right. He is an orphan."

Then he turned and followed Henry inside.

In the living room, servants gawked as the small boy stormed in.

"Evelyn Thorne! I’m here for you!" Henry shouted toward the staircase.

Mrs. Wilkins recognized him immediately. "Henry, isn’t it?" She knelt, smiling warmly. "Your mommy is still resting. She’ll be down soon."

Just then, Dominic entered, his eyes locking onto Henry’s backpack. He snatched it, yanking out the laptop inside.

"Did you cut the power?" His voice was dangerously quiet. "Turn it back on. Now. Or else—"

Henry lifted his chin, meeting Dominic’s glare with defiance.

And when Dominic finally saw his face—really saw him—his words died in his throat.

His heart stopped.
###Chapter 228

Dominic couldn't shake the uncanny familiarity that washed over him every time he caught sight of Henry's face.

It was like staring into a mirror from his own childhood.

Henry shot Dominic a defiant glare before quickly looking away.

"Did you really cut the power, Henry?" Mrs. Wilkins asked, her voice trembling. "How on earth did you manage that? Is this your laptop? You're far too young to know how to use something like this!"

Henry pressed his lips together in silence, then carefully tucked his laptop back into his backpack.

Slinging the bag over his shoulder, he walked to the base of the stairs and sat down, waiting for Evelyn to come down.

Mrs. Wilkins glanced nervously at Dominic, whose expression had darkened with barely restrained fury.

If Henry hadn’t been a child, he wouldn’t have been sitting there unharmed.

About thirty minutes later, a bodyguard entered and reported, "Sir, there's a suspicious foreigner lingering outside, watching the house. Should we bring him in for questioning?"

Nathan's face flashed through Dominic's mind.

He strode toward the front yard but spotted Nathan’s golden hair before he even reached the gates.

"Evelyn! Are you being held against your will? Scream if you need help! I’ll call the police right now!" Nathan shouted in Dominic’s direction.

Rage surged through Dominic’s veins.

Nathan still bore the bruises from last night’s beating, yet here he was, stirring trouble again.

"Grab him," Dominic ordered, his patience wearing thin.

Two bodyguards immediately seized Nathan by the arms.

"Hey! What’s the meaning of this? I haven’t broken any laws! Since when is standing on a public sidewalk a crime? I’m calling my lawyer!" Nathan yelled as he was dragged into the living room.

Henry’s eyes widened in surprise when he saw Nathan.

After exchanging a quick glance with the boy, Nathan wrenched himself free from the bodyguards' grip and sauntered around the room, inspecting the decor with exaggerated disdain.

The bodyguards shadowed him closely.

"Is this your so-called 'luxury mansion'? Did the interior designer scam you?" Nathan scoffed. "It’s nothing compared to the villa Evelyn bought for four and a half million!"

Dominic sipped his tea calmly, refusing to engage.

It was clear Nathan wasn’t here for Evelyn—he was here to provoke a fight.

Still nursing his wounded pride from last night’s beating, no doubt.

When Nathan flicked the light switch on the wall, nothing happened.

His grin widened.

"Power outage? No wonder it’s sweltering in here! Aren’t you suffocating in that ridiculous robe, Blackwood? Maybe you should call your electricians—oh wait, you probably don’t have any on speed dial!"

Nathan’s laughter grated on Dominic’s nerves, his smirk infuriatingly smug.

Dominic’s fists clenched, his knuckles turning white.

Just as he was about to retaliate, the crystal chandelier above them flickered to life.

The power was back.

The air conditioning hummed to life, cooling the room instantly.

Nathan stared at the chandelier for a long moment before sighing dramatically.

"Let’s settle this like men, Blackwood. I’m still pissed about last night. If you win, you can punch me again. Fair?"

Dominic arched a brow. "And if you lose?"

Nathan smirked. "If I lose, I’ll take Henry with me."

Dominic nearly choked on his tea.

Was this man out of his mind?

The bet held zero appeal for Dominic, but before he could refuse, Henry spoke up.

"Dominic Blackwood! Are you scared?"

The challenge in the boy’s voice was unmistakable, laced with mocking disdain.

Dominic knew he was being baited, but pride won out.

"What’s the bet?" he asked Nathan.

"I saw a tennis court outside. First to six games wins."

Dominic set down his tea. "Fine."

After changing into athletic wear, Dominic and Nathan headed to the court.

Nearly everyone in the house—except the gate guards and Mrs. Wilkins—followed to watch.

Meanwhile, Lily slipped unnoticed into the living room from the front yard.
###Chapter 229

Lily needed to search for her mother on the first floor when she suddenly heard footsteps echoing from the kitchen.

Her tiny body froze in terror, barely daring to breathe before she bolted up the staircase.

Reaching the second floor, Lily pressed herself against the wall, her little chest heaving as she tried to catch her breath.

The footsteps were getting closer now.

Whoever it was had started climbing the stairs!

Panic surged through Lily as she frantically looked for a hiding spot.

Moments later, Mrs. Wilkins appeared on the second floor, making her way purposefully toward the master bedroom where Evelyn rested.

The housekeeper was deeply concerned about the tennis match between Dominic and Mike.

Though Dominic had recovered from his accident years ago, doctors had warned him against intense physical exertion.

Mrs. Wilkins couldn't bear the thought of Dominic losing and taking Mike's punch, so she had come to wake Evelyn.

She opened the door quietly and approached the bed.

Mrs. Wilkins studied Evelyn's peaceful sleeping face, conflicted about disturbing her rest but knowing this couldn't wait.

If the match concluded, it would be too late.

"Evelyn," Mrs. Wilkins called softly, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder. "Evelyn!"

Evelyn's brows knitted together at the disturbance.

"Wake up, dear," Mrs. Wilkins insisted, raising her voice slightly.

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open slowly.

Her bleary gaze focused on Mrs. Wilkins, and she managed a weak smile.

"Please wake up. Mike and Master Dominic are at the tennis courts. You must stop them! You know about Master Dominic's leg condition," Mrs. Wilkins explained urgently as she helped Evelyn sit up.

Rubbing her tired eyes, Evelyn murmured, "Mike and Dominic are playing tennis?"

"Yes!" Mrs. Wilkins exclaimed, then quickly recounted everything that had transpired earlier.

As Evelyn glanced around the unfamiliar room, a cold sweat broke out across her back.

"How did I get here?!"

After a brief hesitation, Mrs. Wilkins answered truthfully, "You locked yourself in your car and fell asleep last night. Heaven knows what might have happened if Master Dominic hadn't found you in time and rushed you to the hospital. We must hurry to the tennis courts now!"

The tennis match came to an abrupt halt when Evelyn appeared.

Her gaze swept over Henry and Mike before finally settling on Dominic's face.

"Thank you for last night."

"Don't mention it. You should get another check-up at the hospital." Seeing Evelyn's pale face seemed to calm the storm of emotions within him.

"Your blood tests showed some abnormalities last night."

"I understand..." Evelyn replied.

Aside from exhaustion, she didn't feel particularly unwell.

Mike suddenly grabbed her arm. "I'm taking you to the hospital right now!"

As they walked away, Evelyn couldn't help but glance back at Dominic.

She'd been exhausted after work last night when Mike called her to the hotel for a birthday surprise.

She'd declined, but Mike had insisted, leaving her no choice but to force herself to drive there.

Eventually, the fatigue overwhelmed her, and she'd pulled over before passing out in the car.

She'd wanted to call for help, but her body refused to cooperate.

That's how she'd ended up spending the night in her vehicle.

A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine as she remembered.

She might have died if no one had found her.

When Dominic returned to the living room, Mrs. Wilkins placed a steaming bowl of chicken soup before him.

"This was Evelyn's favorite. Such a shame she didn't get to have any," Mrs. Wilkins said regretfully.

Dominic finished the soup in silence before retreating to his room to rest.

At three o'clock that afternoon, a piercing wail shattered the mansion's peaceful atmosphere.

Dominic bolted upright at the childlike yet deafening cry.

It sounded like a child sobbing!

Hadn't Henry already left? Unless...
###Chapter 230

Could there possibly be another child in the mansion?!

Dominic drew a sharp, icy breath!

He stepped out of the room and spotted Lily's tiny frame shaking with sobs at the staircase landing.

It was Evelyn's daughter!

How absurd!

When had she slipped into his home?

How had his state-of-the-art security system failed to detect her?

Dominic suddenly recalled they'd only restored the mansion's security systems two hours prior.

Lily clutched a plush bunny in one hand while gripping the banister with the other, her bunny-shaped backpack bouncing as she descended the stairs between sobs.

She remained oblivious to Dominic shadowing her steps.

Servants gathered below, gaping at the apparition-like child who'd materialized in their midst.

"Mommy... Mommy's gone... I cried so loud... She didn't come... Waaah!"

Lily's wails came in rhythmic waves, like a sputtering motor.

"Aren't you Evelyn Thorne's little girl, sweetheart?"

Mrs. Wilkins approached and lifted Lily down the remaining steps.

Pouting through tears, Lily whimpered, "Did Mommy and Henry leave without me?"

"Hours ago, dear. However did you get inside? We never saw you arrive." Mrs. Wilkins settled Lily on the sofa, dabbing her cheeks with a tissue.

The child was exquisite - a miniature replica of Evelyn.

Anyone could see she was Evelyn's flesh and blood.

Though Mrs. Wilkins burned with curiosity about the father, she held her tongue.

That was Dominic's business to investigate.

"I sneaked in when nobody looked... Been hiding forever... Just wanted Mommy!" Lily sniffled. "Why didn't they call me? Uncle Mike knew I was here..."

Dominic loomed over her, studying the tear-streaked face.

"Don't stare at me!" Lily suddenly glared, turning her back on him with a huff.

Dominic's temper flared.

The audacity of this trespassing brat to treat him with such contempt!

This was Evelyn's parenting at work.

Just then, Sophia emerged from her room.

Spotting Lily, she brightened and hurried over.

Sophia recognized the child, though the name escaped her.

She extended her hand toward Lily.

Lily's gaze lifted, then immediately scrunched in displeasure as she glared at Sophia.

Not satisfied, the little girl tilted her chin up and snorted disdainfully.

Rather than deterred, Sophia clasped Lily's hand more firmly.

Dominic massaged his temples.

Why did Sophia gravitate toward Evelyn and her offspring?

Had they met before? Formed some bond?

Why else would she persistently seek their touch?

It made no sense!

"Go away!" Lily yanked her hand back violently. "I won't play with you!"

Sophia froze, eyes welling with hurt.

Dominic's chest constricted.

Not only were Evelyn's children ill-mannered, but downright vicious!

What kind of twisted joke was this?

"Lily Thorne! Remember whose roof you're under!" Dominic thundered. "Didn't your mother teach you basic manners? And furthermore..."
###Chapter 231

"Why are you yelling at me?! Of course Mommy taught me to knock before entering someone's house, but she never said anything about knocking before barging into a scoundrel's place!" Lily snapped, her voice rising higher than Dominic's as she glared at him with fiery eyes.

It was as if she was challenging him—a battle of wills to see who could be louder, fiercer.

Dominic clenched his jaw.

Scoundrel?

Who the hell taught her that word?

"I didn’t even want to be here! I’m leaving right now!" Lily huffed, hopping off the couch and stomping toward the door, her doll clutched tightly in her arms.

Meanwhile, at St. Elizabeth Medical Center, after completing a series of routine tests, Evelyn asked Mike for his phone so she could call Clara.

Her own phone was dead, and she needed to reassure her mother that she was safe.

Mike handed his phone over without hesitation.

Clara answered on the second ring.

"It’s me, Mom," Evelyn said, forcing calm into her voice. "I’m fine. I was just exhausted yesterday and fell asleep. Don’t worry—Mike and Henry are with me. We’ll be home soon."

"Oh, thank goodness," Clara sighed in relief. "I’ll start dinner then. Where’s Lily? I know she misses you. Do you want to talk to her?"

Evelyn froze.

"Wait—Mike took Lily with him to find you! Isn’t she with you right now?!"

Evelyn’s blood ran cold.

Her grip on the phone tightened as panic surged through her.

Before she could explode, Mike slapped his forehead. "Oh damn—Lily! She must still be at Dominic Blackwood’s place! I’ll go get her right now!"

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. She was already moving.

"You need to stay here for the test results!" Mike protested.

"You stay here with Henry!" Evelyn snapped, her tone leaving no room for argument. "I’m taking your phone. I’ll meet you back here once I have Lily."

She stormed out of the hospital, flagging down the first cab she saw.

Sliding into the backseat, she pulled out Mike’s phone and dialed Dominic’s number with trembling fingers.

Please, please let Lily still be at the Blackwood mansion.

If she had wandered off somewhere else—

Evelyn couldn’t even finish the thought.

Back at the Blackwood estate, Dominic had scooped Lily up before she could escape, holding her firmly in his arms.

That only made her explode.

"Let me go, you jerk! You’ve hugged other women—I don’t want you touching me!" Lily shrieked, tiny fists pounding against his chest.

Sophia, Dominic’s sister, watched with wide, tear-filled eyes. She wanted to help, but she didn’t dare intervene.

Just then, Dominic’s phone rang.

Mrs. Wilkins quickly handed it to him.

Balancing a squirming Lily in one arm, he answered.

"It’s Evelyn. Is my daughter still with you?" Her voice was frantic. "I’m so sorry—this is all my fault."

Lily’s ears perked up at the sound of her mother’s voice. She snatched the phone from Dominic’s hand.

"Mommy! Is that you?! It’s me, your sweet little Lily!"

Tears welled in Evelyn’s eyes at the sound of her daughter’s voice.

"Lily! I’m so sorry, baby! I didn’t know you came with Mike, and I forgot to take you when we left. Mommy’s coming to get you right now, okay? Don’t be scared—"

"I’m not scared!" Lily chirped confidently. "I knew you’d come for me!"

"Of course I would."

Once she finished, Lily handed the phone back to Dominic—but not before studying his neck with curious eyes.

"Which side did my brother bite you the first time?" she asked sweetly.

Dominic, unsuspecting, pointed to the faint scar.

Lily’s eyes gleamed.

"Oh… There’s still a mark!"

Then—

She sank her teeth into the other side of his neck.

Dominic’s patience snapped.

He had thought she was asking out of concern—maybe even remorse for her brother’s actions.

But no.

This little demon had planned this.

Enough was enough.

Biological daughter or not, Evelyn Thorne’s child was about to learn a very hard lesson.

###Chapter 232

Evelyn reached the Blackwood estate thirty minutes later.

Her heels clicked against the marble floor as she hurried through the grand foyer. The usually bustling mansion felt eerily quiet.

"Lily?" she called out, her voice echoing through the empty living room.

A high-pitched squeal answered her. "Mommy! Help! The monster wants to spank me!"

Evelyn's heart leapt into her throat as she followed the sound into the formal dining room.

There, crouched beneath the massive oak table, was her four-year-old daughter. Lily's golden curls were tangled, her cheeks streaked with tears.

The moment Lily spotted her mother, she scrambled out from her hiding place. "He was gonna get me!" she wailed, throwing herself into Evelyn's arms. "I ran fast but he's big and scary like a giant!"

Evelyn smoothed her daughter's hair, exchanging a glance with Mrs. Wilkins who stood nearby looking helpless. "Sweetheart, no one's going to hurt you," she murmured.

Dominic's deep voice cut through the moment. "Actually, I was considering it."

Evelyn's head snapped up. Dominic leaned against the doorway, his gray silk robe slightly disheveled. A fresh bite mark stood out angrily on his neck.

"Lily Thorne," Evelyn gasped, pulling back to examine her daughter. "Did you do this?"

Dominic's stormy expression darkened further. "She drew blood. Like her brother before her."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Last time, Henry had bitten Dominic when he'd taken the boy without permission. But this? Lily had come here willingly.

The little girl sniffled dramatically. "He picked me up! I told him no but he didn't listen!" Her lower lip trembled. "Hayden says we don't let strangers touch us."

Evelyn sighed. "Biting isn't how we solve problems, baby. You need to apologize."

"Never!" Lily crossed her arms, her tiny face set in stubborn defiance. "Henry will think I'm a traitor!"

Dominic's jaw tightened. "Evelyn. A word. Now."

Handing Lily to Mrs. Wilkins, Evelyn followed Dominic into the study. The moment the door closed, he turned on her.

"What exactly are you teaching those children?" His voice was dangerously quiet. "The hatred they have for me—is that your doing?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I've never said anything negative about you to them."

"Then it's Lucas," Dominic concluded bitterly. His fingers brushed the bite mark. "First your son, now your daughter. Should I expect you to take a chunk out of me next?"

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. "Let me get the medical kit."

When she returned, Dominic had settled onto the leather sofa. As she approached, the open collar of his robe revealed the strong column of his throat, the sharp angle of his collarbone. Her fingers trembled slightly as she cleaned the wound.

"Did you... come to my birthday party last night?" she asked, desperate to fill the tense silence.

Dominic's dark eyes flashed. "I wasn't invited."

Evelyn froze. "Oh. I suppose Lucas thought since we're divorced—"

"You didn't see the guest list?" His accusation hung between them. "I only learned about the celebration yesterday. An entire gala thrown in your honor, and I was excluded."

The bitterness in his voice made her stomach clench. She focused on applying antiseptic, avoiding his piercing gaze. The air between them crackled with unspoken words, the weight of their fractured past pressing down like a physical presence.
###Chapter 233

Dominic’s piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn as he demanded, "What have you been so busy with?"

Evelyn finished bandaging his wound and calmly packed the first aid kit away.

"Just work," she replied, her tone indifferent.

"You're lying." Dominic sat up abruptly, gripping her wrist. "If it were work, why haven’t you been going to the office?" His voice dropped lower. "Something’s off about you lately. I can’t figure you out anymore."

Evelyn pulled her arm free. "There’s nothing to figure out." She exhaled. "Look, Dominic, I appreciate you saving me last night. I can treat you to dinner—or maybe get you a medal."

Dominic released her, his expression shifting to disbelief. "I didn’t do it for your gratitude. Take your daughter and leave. And that son of yours—he hacked into my home’s power and internet today. If you won’t discipline him, I will."

Evelyn winced. "I’m sorry. I’ll talk to him. It won’t happen again."

She returned the first aid kit to its place and scooped Lily into her arms, ready to leave.

"Evelyn." Dominic stepped forward, holding out a small velvet box. "Happy birthday."

Her breath hitched as she stared at the gift. Even without opening it, she knew it was extravagant.

"Thank you, Dominic—"

Before she could finish, Lily snatched the box from his hand with a delighted squeal.

Evelyn’s lips parted in shock.

Dominic smirked, relieved she hadn’t outright rejected him.

"Let’s go home, Mommy! I miss Henry and Grandma!" Lily nuzzled against Evelyn’s shoulder, her voice sweet and pleading.

Evelyn’s chest tightened. "Alright, we’re going." She met Dominic’s gaze one last time. "Goodbye."

Dominic watched them leave, a strange ache in his chest. If only her children treated him with even half the warmth they showed her—maybe then, he could see them as his own.

At Mooncrest Manor, Clara finally saw Evelyn and the children return after hours of anxious waiting.

"Evelyn, never drive when you’re exhausted again! Do you know how dangerous that was?" Clara scolded, her eyes red-rimmed from worry.

"I know, Mom." Evelyn forced a smile, inhaling deeply. "Is that your famous lobster chowder I smell?"

Meanwhile, Henry, starving, had already washed his hands and taken his seat at the dining table.

Lily, however, dragged her brother into their room.

"Henry, guess what I did today?" she whispered excitedly. "I took something from Dirtbag Dad’s house!"

Henry frowned, crossing his arms. "Lily, stealing is wrong."

Her face fell. "But it’s not stealing if it’s from Dad!"

She wished, not for the first time, that Dominic Blackwood wasn’t such a terrible person. Then maybe she could have a real father.

Henry’s expression softened. "Fine. Just don’t get caught."

Lily beamed. "Don’t tell Mommy! She’d be mad."

"Deal. Now hide it and let’s eat."

Lily shoved the box under her bed before grabbing Henry’s hand. "You all left me alone today. I was so scared!"

Henry squeezed her fingers. "I won’t forget you again."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Lily grinned, her earlier fear forgotten. "Oh! Dirtbag Dad gave Mommy a present. Do you think he still loves her?"

###Chapter 234

Henry watched his sister's innocent little face, then crushed her fragile hope with brutal honesty.

"A scoundrel remains a scoundrel because he's capable of loving multiple women simultaneously. Don't be deceived by Dominic Blackwood's charms."

Lily's heart sank.

She couldn't bring herself to confess that despite Dominic being undeniably despicable, an inexplicable pull toward him lingered in her chest.

After dinner, Evelyn summoned Henry to her room for a private discussion.

"Do you understand why I called you here, Henry?"

Henry kept his gaze fixed on the floor, silent.

"You made me a promise—never to provoke Dominic again. Yet today, you broke that vow." Evelyn's voice trembled with concealed anxiety. "I know you acted out of protectiveness, but this isn't the way—"

"Forgive me, Mother." Henry finally met her eyes. "It won't happen again."

"You mustn't make an enemy of him, Henry. Our divorce is finalized. If you anger him beyond reason someday, and he chooses to disregard our shared history..." Evelyn's fingers twisted in her lap. "I only want you, Lily, and Grandma to live undisturbed."

"Understood." Henry's shoulders slumped in resignation.

"Bring me your laptop."

Henry retrieved the device from his room and placed it in Evelyn's waiting hands.

"Now fetch your Uncle Lucas for me," she instructed, setting the laptop aside.

Lucas arrived moments later, attempting nonchalance as he perched on the edge of her bed.

"Color me surprised—Evelyn Thorne inviting me into her private quarters!" His forced chuckle couldn't mask the tension in his jaw.

Evelyn's eyes traced the fresh bruises across his cheekbones. "Another brawl with Nathan Cross? And you smashed his glasses?" Her lips thinned. "Impressive work."

Lucas raised defensive palms. "He grabbed my tie first—a gift from my ex-lover—"

"Let me guess," Evelyn cut in sharply. "Dominic?"

She'd spoken deliberately, ensuring Evelyn absorbed every syllable. This was her calculated move—to make certain Evelyn knew Dominic was dining with another woman tonight.

###Chapter 235 

If Evelyn had any self-respect left, she would have hung up that instant.

The moment Zoe's voice came through the line, Evelyn snapped back to reality.

"I apologize for disturbing your evening. I'll keep the gift, but don't expect anything in return." Her voice turned icy. "And please... never send me anything again."

She ended the call before Dominic could utter another word.

The abrupt disconnection sent a sharp pang through Dominic's chest, leaving behind a lingering ache.

"I heard Evelyn locked herself in her car last night. Is she okay now?" Zoe inquired casually.

"She's fine." Dominic's tone was dismissive. "You mentioned a specialist you wanted to recommend?"

Zoe retrieved a business card from her designer purse and handed it to him.

"This is Eldermere's top psychiatrist. Her schedule is booked solid until next year." Zoe smiled knowingly. "I pulled some strings to get you an appointment next Wednesday morning. You can take Sophia then."

Dominic glanced at the embossed card.

It matched the recommendation from their family physician.

Meanwhile at Mooncrest Manor, Evelyn emerged from her shower, her damp hair wrapped in a towel. She padded softly to the children's room.

Lily was engrossed in cartoons while Henry focused intently on his puzzle.

Evelyn had set their bedtime for 9 p.m., allowing them free time until then.

"Mommy," Henry called out when he noticed her, immediately abandoning his puzzle pieces.

Evelyn sank onto the plush carpet beside her son. "Are you still upset about the laptop?" she asked gently.

Henry nodded solemnly.

Life felt incomplete without his precious device.

Yet...

"I still love you just the same," he declared with heartbreaking sincerity.

Evelyn's eyes welled up as she pulled him into a tight embrace. "I'll return it soon," she whispered into his hair.

"Okay," Henry agreed, his stern expression softening. "You should rest now, Mommy. I'll put Lily to bed."

"Alright."

At precisely nine o'clock, the room plunged into darkness as the children settled under their covers.

Lily stared wide-eyed at the ceiling, restless energy radiating from her small frame.

"Henry, I can't open that box! Will you do it for me?" She reached out, tugging insistently at her brother's pajama sleeve.

"We'll look tomorrow."

"But I want to see inside now! Maybe there's pretty jewelry!" Lily's voice rose with excitement.

"Impossible," Henry stated matter-of-factly.

Dominic Blackwood was a businessman.

What use would he have for jewelry in his study?

Lily bolted upright, suddenly wide awake.

"I won't sleep until you open it!" she declared dramatically. "I'll stay awake all night... until I collapse from exhaustion!"

Henry exhaled deeply at his sister's theatrics.

He switched on the bedside lamp, dimming it to its lowest setting.

Lily scrambled from bed and retrieved the mysterious box from its hiding spot beneath the frame.

With ceremonial gravity, she presented it to her brother like a sacred offering.

"What if you can't open it either?" Lily whispered, eyes fixed on the container.

The moment the words left her mouth, Henry flipped the lid open with ease.

Lily gasped. "What's inside?"

Henry turned the open box toward her.

No glittering treasures greeted them.

Lily's hopeful expression crumpled.

"What is that?" she asked, upending the box's contents onto the bedspread.
###Chapter 236

Henry adjusted the bedside lamp, casting a brighter glow across the mysterious box.

Inside lay two items - a blank CD and a single sheet of paper covered in cryptic writing.

Lily unfolded the paper carefully, her small fingers tracing the unfamiliar symbols. Her forehead wrinkled in concentration before she turned to her brother. "Henry, what does this say? It looks like secret code!"

Henry studied the document briefly before shrugging. "Beats me. It's all technical mumbo-jumbo."

The page might as well have been written in ancient hieroglyphics for all the sense it made to the four-year-olds.

Lily's attention shifted to the unmarked CD, turning it over in her hands. "There's nothing on it! No pictures, no words... nothing!"

Henry's curiosity burned just as brightly. Without a computer, the disc's contents remained a frustrating mystery.

"We need Uncle Dominic's laptop!" Lily declared suddenly, her eyes lighting up with excitement. "I'll go ask him! You stay here - Mommy gets mad when you use electronics without permission!"

Before Henry could protest, his sister was already dashing toward the door. Concerned she might drop the heavy device, he hurried after her.

Dominic wasn't at his usual bar haunt that evening - the bruises from yesterday's altercation made socializing impossible. When the twins burst into his room, he was immersed in an intense video game battle.

"Shouldn't you two be asleep?" Dominic barely glanced up from his screen, fingers flying across the keyboard.

The children ignored his question, their focus locked on the glowing laptop.

"Uncle Dom, can we borrow your computer? Just for a tiny minute?" Lily deployed her most charming smile.

Henry wasted no time once they got access. He fast-forwarded through the video, his small face growing serious as images flashed by.

"It's a funeral," he announced abruptly, shutting the laptop with finality. "Really scary stuff. You don't want to see it."

Lily's lower lip jutted out. "You're not tricking me, are you?"

"Would I lie about something like that?" Henry hugged the laptop protectively. "Somebody died. No idea who."

As Henry left to return the computer, Lily carefully replaced both items in the box, her young mind swirling with unanswered questions about the mysterious recording.

###Chapter 237 

If Lily had known what was inside that box, she would never have risked bringing it back.

Content (C) N?v/elDra/ma.Org.

Now, returning it unnoticed seemed impossible.

She'd probably lost all access to her worthless father's house forever.

Fine. She'd just stash it beneath her bed.

Just a stupid CD and some random paper—nothing worth fretting over.

By the time Dominic stepped into the bedroom after putting the laptop away, Lily was already fast asleep.

In the adjacent room, Evelyn lay wide awake.

Maybe it was because she'd slept too much earlier that she couldn't drift off now.

Insomnia always made her thoughts spiral.

Right now, her mind was consumed by Dominic.

His sharp jawline, the way his eyes darkened when he was serious, even the warmth of his hands—all of it haunted her.

If he hadn't found her that night, she'd either be dead or fighting for her life in the ICU.

So much to say, yet no right to speak any of it.

Dominic wasn't hers anymore.

Sophia held his heart, and Zoe clung to his side.

Evelyn? Just an ex-wife.

No rewinding their story now.

Tears burned down her cheeks as she squeezed her eyes shut, forcing the memories away.

Perfect lives didn't exist.

She had Henry and Lily. She had her company.

More blessings than most could claim.

Greed had no place here.

Three days later, Zoe realized her period was late.

A full week.

Alarm spiked—her cycle never faltered.

She rushed to a pharmacy at dawn, grabbing a pregnancy test.

Bypassing home, she ducked into a public restroom.

Fifteen minutes later, she stumbled out, face bloodless, fingers clawing the wall for support.

Pregnant.

She was actually pregnant.

One reckless night with Julian at that hotel, and this happened.

Her teeth sank into her lower lip until it bruised purple.

Violent tremors wracked her body.

Why was fate this cruel?

She was meant to be Mrs. Dominic Blackwood, not shackled to Julian!

Of all men, why did it have to be Julian's child?

Her nails carved half-moons into her palms, but the physical pain barely registered.

This was a knife twisting in her chest.

She found a secluded spot and dialed Julian.

He answered after several rings, voice thick with sleep.

"Yes, Dr. Montgomery?"

"I'll murder you, Julian Whitmore!" she seethed. "Get here now. Ten minutes. One second late, and I'll strangle you myself!"

Julian bolted upright, sheets damp with cold sweat.

"Dr. Montgomery, what—"

The line went dead.

Zoe collapsed against the wall, silent sobs shaking her shoulders.

Dominic could never find out.

She had to stay with him.

She'd abandoned her career abroad for him.

Everyone envied her as Dominic Blackwood's girlfriend.

This child couldn't ruin everything.

But fertility had always been fragile for her. An abortion might mean no second chances.
###Chapter 238

Ten minutes later, Julian appeared in front of Zoe.

He was still in his sleepwear, hastily thrown-on sandals slapping against the pavement.

His usually styled hair stuck up in chaotic tufts—he hadn’t even bothered to run a hand through it after her frantic call.

He wanted to scream.

That phone call had been bizarre.

How dare she speak to him like that?

He wasn’t the one who orchestrated that disastrous night at the hotel. He was just as blindsided as she was!

But the moment he saw Zoe’s tear-streaked face, his anger evaporated.

“What’s wrong, Dr. Montgomery?” Julian asked, then swallowed hard before adding, “My uncle didn’t break things off, did he?”

Zoe let out a hollow laugh, bracing herself against the nearby tree as she stood.

“I’m pregnant, Julian Whitmore,” she spat, the metallic tang of blood filling her mouth from how hard she’d been biting her lip. “And you’re the father.”

Julian’s face went slack.

“That’s impossible… It was just one time…” he muttered, voice shaking.

Before he could react further, Zoe snatched her bag and swung it at him with all her strength.

“You selfish, spineless coward!” she shrieked, striking him again and again. “What the hell am I supposed to do now? Tell me! What do I do?!”

Julian shielded his head, wincing. “Terminate it! What other choice is there? If Dominic finds out you’re carrying my child, he’ll murder me!”

Tears spilled down Zoe’s cheeks at his words.

“I want to! The idea of carrying your child makes me sick!” she choked out. “But if I do it now, I might never conceive again!”

Her legs gave out.

She crumpled to the ground, arms wrapped around herself as violent sobs wracked her body.

Julian finally grasped the gravity of the situation.

No wonder she’d lost it.

If abortion wasn’t an option, things just got infinitely more complicated.

He sank down beside her, hesitantly patting her back.

“I’m sorry, Dr. Montgomery,” he whispered. “This is all my fault. You were drunk that night, but I was sober. I knew you were my uncle’s girlfriend, and I still…” He slapped his own face hard. “I’m disgusting.”

Zoe lifted her head, some of her fury dissipating at the genuine remorse in his expression.

“We’re keeping it,” she said after a steadying breath. “Dominic doesn’t love me. Once he finds another doctor for Sophia, he’ll discard me without a second thought.”

She’d always known Dominic was searching for someone else to treat his sister’s condition.

Julian paled. “You can’t let him find out it’s mine. He’ll actually kill me.”

“Are you that terrified of dying?” Zoe sneered.

“I’m twenty-six! I haven’t even lived yet!” Julian shot back, helping her up. “Aren’t you scared? Though, even if he finds out, he wouldn’t kill you. You did save Sophia once.”

His words sparked something in her.

If the worst outcome was Dominic leaving her, then what did she have to lose?

“Go home,” she ordered, pulling away from him. “I’m going to the hospital for confirmation. I’ll contact you once I know for sure.”

She jabbed a finger into his chest.

“From now on, you do exactly as I say. Or you’re dead.”

Julian had no choice.

That unborn child was proof of his betrayal.

And now, Zoe held all the power.

Meanwhile, across town, a sleek black Rolls-Royce glided to a stop outside Willowbrook Psychiatric Center.

Dominic and Sophia stepped out.

The moment they entered, the attending physician greeted them before directing Dominic to the waiting area.

“Don’t be afraid, Sophia. I’ll be right outside,” Dominic murmured, attempting to release her hand.

But Sophia’s grip only tightened, her fingers trembling around his.

###Chapter 239

Dominic reached into his pocket and pulled out two pieces of candy, pressing them into Sophia's trembling hand.

The moment the sweets touched her palm, Sophia finally released her tight grip on his fingers.

Watching her disappear through the doors of the treatment center, Dominic's chest tightened with unease.

This was the first time he had ever brought her to see a psychiatrist.

And not just any psychiatrist—one of the most renowned specialists in the country.

Would she be able to break through the walls in Sophia's mind?

Thirty minutes later, the doors swung open again.

Sophia rushed out, her small frame colliding with Dominic's as she buried her face against his chest.

Her breathing was steady, her emotions surprisingly calm.

No tears. Just the faintest tremble of fear lingering in her posture.

Dominic wrapped his arms around her, one hand gently stroking her back.

"It's okay, Sophia. I never left."

The doctor gestured for Dominic to take a seat on the nearby couch.

"Mr. Blackwood, I reviewed the documents you sent last night. After speaking with Sophia just now, I don't believe psychiatric treatment is what she needs at this stage. Her condition isn't purely psychological. She requires medical intervention first—proper surgical care. Once her physical health stabilizes, she may not even need therapy."

"Did she say anything to you?" Dominic asked, his voice low.

The doctor shook her head. "I had her respond by nodding or shaking her head. She was very cooperative."

She handed Dominic a sheet of paper—a questionnaire filled with simple questions and Sophia's silent answers.

Favorite memories. People she loved. Her deepest fears.

Every response pointed back to him.

"Her neurological condition overshadows any psychological concerns," the doctor assured. "There's no need for excessive worry, Mr. Blackwood."

Dominic stood, tucking the paper into his coat. "Thank you."

Just as he turned to leave, the clinic doors opened again.

A woman stepped inside, holding the hand of a small boy.

Before Dominic could react, Sophia had already broken away from him, moving toward the child with a sudden, radiant smile.

Evelyn had booked this appointment the moment they returned to the country.

Henry's struggles in school had become impossible to ignore.

Every time she heard of a reputable specialist, she brought him, hoping for a breakthrough.

Now, Sophia stood before Henry, beaming as if she'd known him forever.

Evelyn froze.

What was Sophia doing here? Had Dominic brought her?

Then she saw him—tall, imposing, stepping forward to gently pull Sophia back to his side.

Dominic's gaze flickered to Evelyn before settling on Henry. "Your son should see a psychiatrist."

There was no malice in his tone.

Only cold observation.

Henry's behavioral issues were obvious. Early intervention was logical.

But Evelyn heard only judgment.

"Does the CEO of Blackwood Group really have nothing better to do than mock a four-year-old?"

A muscle twitched in Dominic's jaw. "I wasn't mocking him. I'm here with Sophia."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, tightening her grip on Henry's hand as she steered him around them.

Thirty minutes later, the treatment room door reopened.

Evelyn emerged, the doctor following with another questionnaire.

"Miss Thorne, your child's differences don't equate to psychological disorders," the doctor said kindly.

Evelyn scanned the paper, murmured her thanks, and led Henry toward the exit.

They had barely taken two steps outside when a shadow fell across their path.

Dominic stood before them, his expression unreadable.

###Chapter 240

"Let's grab lunch," Dominic suggested, his voice smooth as he extended the invitation to Evelyn.

She met his gaze, suspicion flickering in her eyes. "Have you been standing out here the whole time?"

Dominic didn’t answer.

If he hadn’t been waiting for her, he would’ve left ages ago.

Evelyn tilted her face toward the sun.

Early autumn had softened its intensity, but the afternoon rays still carried a lingering warmth.

"Where’s Sophia?" she asked.

Dominic glanced toward the parking lot. "She’s in the car."

"I see… You two go ahead. My mom cooked, so we’re heading home for lunch," Evelyn replied, her refusal swift and firm.

She couldn’t fathom why Dominic would even suggest sharing a meal with Sophia present.

Did he have no shame?

Even if he wanted to juggle multiple women—no, three—he didn’t have to be this blatant about it.

"I already made reservations at that restaurant over there," Dominic said, unfazed by her rejection. "Sophia needs to go to Willowbrook Academy later, and so does Henry. Let’s eat first, then take them together."

Evelyn pressed her lips together.

After a brief pause, she shook her head. "We’re eating at home. I’ll take Henry to school after his nap."

Realizing politeness wouldn’t work, Dominic switched tactics.

"Why are you so afraid of having lunch with me?" His voice dropped, laced with challenge. "Can’t exes share a meal? Or are you avoiding me because you still have feelings?"

Evelyn’s temper flared.

She forced herself to stay composed, then took Henry’s hand and marched toward the restaurant.

Dominic smirked and went to fetch Sophia from the car.

Once seated, the air between them thickened with tension.

Evelyn skimmed the menu, ordered a few dishes, then slid it across the table to Dominic.

He passed it to Sophia without hesitation.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her glass.

She poured herself water, lifted it, and took a reckless gulp—only to realize too late it was scalding.

She choked, her throat burning.

Dominic was on his feet instantly. He snatched the jug, strode to the counter, and returned with ice water, pouring her a fresh glass.

"Drink," he commanded, his voice rough with concern.

Evelyn obeyed, the cold liquid soothing the burn. "I’m fine."

"What were you thinking?" His gaze bore into her. "You’re never this careless."

Her cheeks flushed. "Ask me that again after I pour hot water on you."

"Did I upset you?" He leaned back, pouring himself a glass and taking a slow sip.

"I never wanted this lunch," Evelyn shot back, keeping her voice low for Henry’s sake. "Let’s see how well you eat if I brought another man and flirted with him right in front of you."

Dominic’s brow furrowed. "You think I’m being inappropriate with Sophia?"

Evelyn ignored him, focusing on her phone.

If he couldn’t see it, then fine.

A man who could date two women at once had no principles left.

Dominic understood now.

Her reaction had spiked the moment he handed the menu to Sophia.

If jealousy was her response to something so small, then she still cared.

"Put the phone down, Evelyn." He reached over and plucked it from her hand.

She stiffened.

Dominic set it aside, determined to talk properly.

With Sophia and Henry present, their conversation would stay private—no risk of secrets slipping out.
###Chapter 241

This was Dominic's golden opportunity to have a meaningful conversation with Evelyn.

"Sophia and..."

He started speaking, but the photo on Evelyn's phone screen caught his eye.

Belonging to N?velDrama.Org.

"Who is this man?"

He looked vaguely familiar.

Dominic kept staring at the photo.

He was certain he'd seen the man somewhere before, but couldn't place him.

Evelyn yanked her phone back.

"Some things never change. Still as domineering as ever. Is this some midlife crisis thing?"

She stuffed her phone into her purse, then taunted, "He's a rising star I've been following lately. Gorgeous, isn't he? And so young. Exactly my type these days."

Dominic clenched his jaw in fury.

Did she just call him old?

He'd planned to have a serious talk with her, but clearly that wasn't happening!

Apparently she only had eyes for younger men now!

"What were you going to tell me earlier?" Evelyn asked.

Seeing Dominic's angry expression lifted her mood. "Nothing!" Dominic snapped coldly. "Just eat!"

The lunch turned into an uncomfortable affair.

While Dominic paid the bill, Evelyn left with Henry.

At St. Elizabeth Medical Center, Zoe Montgomery stared at her test results as fresh tears spilled down her cheeks.

The entire morning had felt like an endless nightmare.

The worst part? Waking up to realize the nightmare was reality!

She was carrying Julian Whitmore's child!

Exiting the hospital, Zoe started brainstorming solutions.

There had to be a way out of this mess!

When life closes a door, it opens a window somewhere.

As long as no one discovered the baby's true father, the situation wasn't as dire as it seemed.

Besides, Dominic still needed her expertise to treat Sophia's condition.

No matter how bad things got, she'd never sink as low as Evelyn.

This thought calmed her somewhat.

Returning home, Zoe collapsed onto her bed.

Her head pounded, but sleep eluded her no matter how hard she squeezed her eyes shut.

Thirty minutes later, she called Julian.

"I need to sleep with Dominic," Zoe revealed her plan. "That way we can pass the baby off as his."

Julian was stunned into silence, then panicked.

"That's... possible. But what if Uncle demands a DNA test after the birth? We'd be exposed!"

"I have a plan! Just follow my lead!"

"Alright! I won't question you. I'll do whatever you say," Julian surrendered, afraid to say more. "But how exactly do you plan to get my uncle into bed? He's not an easy target."

"Do I look like I have all the answers?" Zoe snapped. "Figure something out! Unless you want your uncle discovering this is your child!"

"Got it!" Julian whined. "I'll come up with something immediately."

That afternoon, Evelyn received a call from Sophie.

"Evelyn, Mike told me about your surprise birthday party."

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "That fool is throwing parties in my name again!"

Sophie burst out laughing. "I think he just wants an excuse to party and is using your birthday."

"Obviously... Did he call you too?"

"Yes! I'll definitely be there this weekend. Are you inviting Dominic this time? He was quite upset about missing your last party," Sophie said. "He even booked the adjacent banquet hall. So petty!"

Evelyn groaned. "We just had another fight. Doubt he'll want to come."

"What happened this time?"

"Long story."

"Got it. Should I have Adrian invite him? If he's interested, you could extend the invitation," Sophie suggested, then added with a chuckle, "I heard you accepted his gift. Seems rude not to invite him after that."
###Chapter 242

Evelyn was rendered utterly speechless by Sophie's blunt remark.

This entire mess was entirely her own doing!

Why on earth had she accepted Dominic's extravagant gift?

None of this awkwardness would be happening if she'd simply refused it like she should have.

With an exasperated sigh, Evelyn ended the call with Sophie, then immediately dialed Vincent. "Don't you think it would've been courteous to consult me before planning some surprise birthday celebration?"

"And what if you'd said no?" Vincent countered, his tone dripping with familiarity. "I know you too well, Evelyn. By informing everyone else first, I've effectively trapped you into attending."

Evelyn let out a humorless chuckle.

"Then enjoy your little gathering without me! I won't be there!"

"I've already invited Dominic Blackwood! That arrogant bastard accepted immediately!" Vincent taunted. "Your ex-husband truly has no shame, Evelyn. What did you ever see in a man like him?"

Rubbing her temples, Evelyn disconnected the call without another word.

Sophie's call came through again within seconds.

"Dominic's actually coming to the party, Evelyn! I was certain someone with his pride would decline!" Sophie exclaimed. "I can never anticipate his reactions. Is this unpredictability some special quality all powerful men possess?"

"You couldn't predict a madman's actions either," Evelyn snapped. "Stop romanticizing his behavior, Sophie."

"Hah! You always get so defensive when we discuss him," Sophie observed slyly. "That's proof enough you still have feelings for him! Normal people don't react this strongly!"

Evelyn gulped down half a glass of water before fabricating an excuse to end the conversation.

She suddenly longed for the days when her schedule left no room for such complications.

After securing Dominic's attendance, Vincent retreated to the bathroom to collect himself.

Once sufficiently composed, he dialed Nathan's number - a sequence he'd somehow memorized despite deleting it months ago.

The line rang endlessly before finally connecting.

"I'm shocked you answered! Why didn't you respond to my text last week?"

Vincent had been forced to send an apology text under Evelyn's threats, but Nathan's silence had gnawed at him.

"You have every right to text me, just as I have every right not to respond," Nathan replied icily. "Don't disturb me during work hours without cause."

"I do have cause! Are you attending Evelyn's birthday this weekend?"

"That depends entirely on whether Mr. Blackwood attends."

"Well Dominic Blackwood confirmed he's coming!"

"Then I'll be accompanying him," Nathan stated before adding curtly, "I'm currently occupied. Refrain from calling during business hours."

The line went dead.

White-hot rage surged through Vincent.

Who did this insignificant assistant think he was?

What could possibly be keeping him so busy?

Dominic hadn't dismissed him so rudely!

As second-in-command at Thornfield Industries, Vincent never claimed to be too busy for anyone!

Moments later, Vincent created a new group chat with several department heads.

The chat title - "Operation: Blackwood Downfall" - immediately caused panic among the recipients, with none daring to respond initially.

Vincent: (We're taking down Dominic Blackwood at Saturday's party! Who's with me?!)

After an agonizing pause, one manager tentatively replied: (How exactly?)

Vincent: (Alcohol, obviously! What else would work?)

The tension in the group immediately dissipated.

###Chapter 243 

[My alcohol tolerance is insane!]

[It's all of us versus Dominic Blackwood. We've got this!]

Julian Whitmore smirked as he read the fired-up messages lighting up his phone screen.

Why had he been so generous inviting Dominic to this party?

This was his master plan.

Hurt Evelyn Thorne, and you hurt him.

Julian might not be able to take Dominic down in business, but outdrinking him? That was his specialty!

That evening, Eleanor Blackwood requested Dominic bring Zoe Montgomery to the family estate for dinner.

The meal commenced as soon as they arrived.

"You should visit more often when you're free, Doctor Montgomery," Eleanor said warmly. "Dominic rarely makes time for you."

Zoe nodded gracefully. "Of course. I'll come by regularly if I'm not intruding."

"Intruding? Nonsense! I adore accomplished women like you!"

After the pleasant dinner, Eleanor summoned Dominic to her private quarters.

"Doctor Montgomery would make an excellent match, Dominic. You're not getting younger. Why not get engaged?" Eleanor pressed.

"Not until Sophia's fully recovered," Dominic deflected, searching for excuses.

"Sophia's condition has nothing to do with your marriage!"

"I want her present at my wedding."

"Dominic, she could attend right now! Didn't you say her condition improved post-surgery?"

He shook his head stubbornly.

"I'm suggesting engagement, not marriage. Doctor Montgomery sacrificed her prestigious career for you. Show some gratitude," Eleanor chided, then demanded, "What's really holding you back?"

"No engagement," Dominic stated flatly. "I don't love her. The moment I find another specialist for Sophia, we're through. You're a woman, Mother. You know marrying her without love would destroy her."

Eleanor's expression hardened.

"Do you think I married your father for love? Many couples maintain perfect facades while living separate lives. Their marriages still last decades."

"Just because others tolerate misery doesn't mean I will," Dominic countered.

"You're impossible! Fine, I won't nag further," Eleanor snapped, changing subjects abruptly. "Your father's death anniversary is next month."

Dominic's jaw tightened. "I know. If that's all, I'm leaving."

"At least reconsider things with Doctor Montgomery!"

Exiting, Dominic informed Zoe of his departure.

Zoe walked him out. "I'll stay a while longer."

He gave a curt nod.

Thirty minutes later, Eleanor retired for the night.

Julian finally cornered Zoe alone.

"Confirmed—my uncle's attending Evelyn's birthday this Saturday," Julian revealed, studying Zoe's reaction. "He'll definitely drink. Retrieve him when he's wasted. If he's blackout drunk, he's yours. If not..."

Julian produced a tiny vial.

"One sip of this, and that proper gentleman becomes an animal in bed."

Zoe's lips parted in shock.

Disgraceful... but necessary.

She snatched the vial, sneering, "You're disturbingly experienced with these tricks."

Julian flushed crimson.

"You asked for solutions, Doctor Montgomery. With my uncle, dirty tricks are the only way he'd ever touch you!"

"Enough! I know he loves Evelyn Thorne! So what? I'm his girlfriend now!" Zoe hissed. "After we sleep together, I'll make him marry me!"

###Chapter 244

The fire in Zoe Montgomery's gaze burned bright, untamed and unapologetic.

Julian Whitmore felt something long dormant stir within him.

If Zoe succeeded, so would he.

A woman could rise through her child—why not a man?

His legacy would be carved through his offspring!

At precisely ten that evening, a sleek black Rolls-Royce glided into the Blackwood estate.

Dominic Blackwood had just returned from an exclusive dinner.

He'd attended solely because the guest of honor was the leading innovator in Eldermere's drone industry.

Dominic wanted every detail about Evelyn Thorne's company.

What he learned chilled him.

Though Thornfield Industries had been rebuilt, its domestic sales had plateaued.

Apex Innovations thrived overseas—renowned, respected.

Yet Evelyn hadn't leveraged that brand in Eldermere, stubbornly clinging to Thornfield's name.

Same technology, different prestige.

No marketing. No campaigns.

The industry titan had whispered that if Evelyn didn't turn things around in six months, she'd be forced back to Bridgedale in disgrace.

The next afternoon, Evelyn walked alone into the Oceanview Grand Hotel's restaurant.

Norman Whitaker, CEO of Eldermere's largest drone distributor, waited at the reserved table.

"You came alone, Miss Thorne?" Norman adjusted his glasses, his shrewd gaze lingering too long on her fitted blazer.

Evelyn's smile remained polished. "My team's occupied with product development."

She slid a dossier across the table. "Our complete specifications, Mr. Whitaker."

He chuckled, not touching the file. "Oh, I've studied your drones. That's precisely why I requested this... private meeting."

His stare traveled from her face downward, slow and deliberate.

"Your tech is impressive. But Eldermere's market isn't as... receptive as overseas."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her water glass. "Enlighten me."

"Make me your exclusive distributor," Norman leaned in, knee brushing hers beneath the table, "and I'll guarantee dominance. Of course, you'd need to adjust pricing..."

Evelyn recoiled, voice turning glacial. "Our offer is non-negotiable."

"Tsk. Where's the trust?" Norman sighed dramatically. "Business requires... intimacy."

Evelyn's lips curved dangerously. "Define 'intimacy,' Mr. Whitaker."

Seizing the invitation, Norman lunged to her side, pudgy fingers gripping her shoulder.

"A woman like you—smart, stunning—must have men lining up. Why waste time on business when—"

Evelyn's grip on her teacup turned white-knuckled.

Three. Two.

A fist shattered the air—Norman crashed to the floor, nose spurting blood.

Dominic loomed over them, eyes wild.

"Evelyn! Is this what you've reduced yourself to?" He hauled her up, voice raw. "You claim to despise old men, yet let this pig grope you? Is money worth your self-respect?"

The restaurant froze.

Evelyn's cheeks burned. If Dominic hadn't intervened, that teacup would've been shattered against Norman's skull.

"Must you shout?" she hissed.

She grabbed her bag, but Dominic wrenched her back into the chair.

"Answer me!" His voice cracked. "Would you really sell yourself for—"

Evelyn exploded.

The dam broke.
###Chapter 245

Evelyn hugged herself tightly, her piercing gaze locked onto Dominic.

She watched as he stripped off his dress shirt, then flung it toward her with a careless motion.

The fabric carried his warmth, his scent—something achingly familiar—wrapping around her like an unwanted embrace.

She hated him.

Yet, beneath the anger, there was something else—something she refused to name.

Dominic strode out of the restaurant, bare-chested, not sparing her another glance.

Evelyn gasped for air, her chest rising and falling rapidly, as if she'd just surfaced from deep water.

The shrill ring of her phone snapped her back to reality.

With trembling hands, she peeled off his shirt, grabbed her bag, and fled.

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Group, Nathan nearly choked on his coffee when the call came in.

Had the world gone mad?

His boss—Dominic Blackwood, the ruthless billionaire—had stormed into a hotel restaurant and thrown a tantrum like a spoiled heir.

He'd cleared the entire place, thrown money around like confetti, and—

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose.

And then stripped off his shirt and left it behind.

If this were a soap opera, the ratings would be through the roof.

Thirty minutes later, the restaurant manager arrived, personally delivering Dominic's abandoned shirt, the scattered cash, and—

Two delicate buttons from a woman's blouse.

Nathan frowned, turning them over in his palm. "Whose are these?"

The manager cleared his throat. "Miss Thorne's, I believe."

"Evelyn Thorne?"

"Yes. They had quite the... altercation. Nearly came to blows—or something else entirely."

Nathan's eyebrows shot up.

"Something else?"

The manager gave him a knowing look.

Nathan exhaled sharply.

This was going to be a long day.
###Chapter 246

Sophie pulled out a fresh blouse for Evelyn.

"What in the world happened to you? How did you manage to tear off all your buttons?" Sophie eyed her suspiciously, then gasped. "Evelyn, did you get into a physical altercation?"

Evelyn shrugged as she slipped into the blouse. "You could say that."

"And you lost, didn't you? You look like you've been through a warzone." Sophie poured her a steaming cup of tea. "You're the CEO of a billion-dollar corporation now. You should really consider hiring security. Look at Dominic—he’s practically surrounded by an army of bodyguards. I heard they’re all ex-special forces..."

Evelyn gave a bitter laugh. "If that’s the case, I don’t need to hire anyone else."

Sophie frowned. "Why?" Then realization dawned. "Oh, tell me he didn’t—what did that bastard do this time?"

Evelyn took a sip of tea before setting the cup down.

"Thanks for the blouse. I need to get back to the office." Lucas had been blowing up her phone for updates on the negotiations.

She had to return immediately. "Let me walk you out," Sophie insisted, concern etched on her face.

"No need, I’m fine. This isn’t our first fight." Evelyn’s voice was weary.

"I know, but it’s the first time he’s laid hands on you!" Sophie suddenly turned and rummaged through her purse before pulling out a sleek canister. She pressed it into Evelyn’s palm. "Take this pepper spray. Next time he tries anything, blind him."

At Thornfield Tower, Lucas did a double take at Evelyn’s changed attire.

"Negotiations didn’t go well?"

"Nope," Evelyn admitted.

"It’s fine," Lucas reassured her. "We can always expand our sales team and handle distribution ourselves."

Evelyn nodded. "That’s what I was thinking. We’re just starting out. Slow and steady wins the race."

Lucas had never been passionate about business or profits. He stayed with Evelyn out of loyalty. He trusted her to lead.

"Lucas, the funds from our overseas ventures might have to cover this project… We could break even, or we might lose everything," Evelyn confessed after a long pause.

"Don’t stress over it. Money comes and goes. We’ll make more." Lucas squeezed her shoulder. "Remember how rough things were when we first started abroad?"

Evelyn exhaled, some tension easing. "Maybe it was easier back then because I had nothing to lose."

"Just focus on your own path. Don’t let others dictate your worth," Lucas said firmly.

Evelyn chuckled, feeling lighter. "Since when did you get so wise, Lucas?"

"Ha! Come on, let’s go shopping. That blouse is tragic on you." Lucas wrinkled his nose. "Your birthday’s this weekend. You need something stunning."

He practically dragged her out of the office.

Late that afternoon, Dominic strode into Blackwood Group’s headquarters with Nathan trailing behind.

"Nathan, I won’t be attending Evelyn’s party this weekend," Dominic stated flatly.

Nathan already knew why. The explosive argument that afternoon had left Dominic seething.

His pride had taken a hit.

Ripping off her blouse and throwing cash in public… Dominic felt humiliated.

Even if the restaurant had been nearly empty, bystanders had undoubtedly witnessed the spectacle.

"I’ll go with Lucas then," Nathan said. "Someone from the company should make an appearance."

Dominic’s gaze landed on a sleek black bag on the table. "What’s this?"

Nathan cleared his throat, struggling for words.
###Chapter 247

Dominic tore open the package, his fingers brushing against the crisp fabric of the shirt and the cold stack of bills inside.

"Pathetic," he muttered under his breath, his jaw tightening.

With a swift motion, he flung the bag across the room. It hit the floor with a dull thud.

"Burn it," Dominic commanded, his voice icy.

Nathan nodded, scooping up the discarded items. "Right away, sir."

Meanwhile, at the bustling shopping district of Ravenshore, Adrian was on a mission.

"Come on, Evelyn, you can't judge a dress by just looking at it," Adrian insisted, piling another armful of outfits into her arms.

Before she could protest, he nudged her toward the fitting room.

"Your boyfriend is so thoughtful," the sales associate gushed, flashing Evelyn an approving smile. "Need any help with those?"

Evelyn shook her head quickly. "I've got it, thanks."

By the time they finished, the afternoon sun had dipped low in the sky. The trunk of Adrian's car was overflowing with shopping bags—new outfits for Evelyn, Lily, Henry, Clara, and even himself.

This was the first time Evelyn had ever indulged in a shopping spree with Adrian. Exhausted, she slumped into a chair at the nearest café, craving nothing more than to go home.

"Eat up," Adrian said, scrolling through his phone. "We're hitting the salon next."

Evelyn groaned. "I'm wiped."

"You can relax there," he countered, flashing her a photo. "Look at this guy from Eldermere. Wealthy, tall, gorgeous—miles ahead of that scumbag Dominic. This is the kind of man you should be aiming for."

Evelyn blinked, her appetite vanishing.

"You really think a new hairstyle and wardrobe will make a man like that notice me?"

"Not on their own," Adrian admitted. "But we’re laying the groundwork. Baby steps."

Evelyn set down her fork, dabbing her lips with a napkin.

"Done? Perfect. Salon time." Adrian whisked her away before she could argue.

The night of Evelyn’s birthday arrived in a whirl of glittering lights.

The grand ballroom of the Oceanview Grand Hotel was alive with chatter and laughter. Clara had opted to stay home with the kids, who weren’t fond of large crowds.

Adrian and Evelyn arrived at four, finding the venue already half-filled with guests.

Evelyn had left her hair loose, the natural waves cascading down her back. Her cream-colored dress, adorned with delicate sequins that shimmered like starlight, hugged her curves perfectly.

Every head turned as she glided into the room.

Lucas and Nathan approached, each holding a gift.

"Happy birthday, Miss Thorne," Lucas said warmly, handing her an elegantly wrapped box. "You look stunning tonight."

Nathan followed suit. "Mr. Blackwood sends his regrets—he had a prior engagement."

Evelyn smiled politely. "Thank you both."

Just then, Adrian gasped, grabbing Nathan’s arm. "Holy hell—isn’t that your boss?"

The entire room fell silent as all eyes turned toward the entrance.

There, framed in the doorway, stood Dominic—impeccably dressed, his presence commanding the room like a storm.
###Chapter 248

Dominic's cheeks flushed crimson. Hadn't someone claimed he wouldn't show up tonight?

What was he doing here suddenly? Did his words carry no weight anymore?

Both Lucas and Nathan rushed toward Dominic, their expressions a mix of surprise and concern.

"I was in the neighborhood," Dominic shrugged casually, his piercing gaze scanning the room. "Thought I'd drop in for the celebration."

"I thought you'd be too scared to face us!" Adrian strode forward, slinging an arm around Dominic's shoulders and steering him toward the bar. "Tonight we celebrate Evelyn's birthday. Rule one: no lectures. Rule two: no fighting. Just drinking!"

Adrian shoved an empty glass into Dominic's hand and poured generously from a crystal decanter.

Evelyn's breath caught. Were they really starting with alcohol before dinner? She watched as the group of men formed a tight circle around Dominic, with Adrian clearly leading the charge.

Then it hit her - this was an ambush! She moved to intervene when Sophie intercepted her. "Let them have their fun!" Sophie tugged Evelyn aside, lowering her voice. "Have you forgotten how he treated you last week? I specifically told Adrian not to bail him out. You shouldn't either."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed. "But we haven't even served dinner yet..."

"I'll get the kitchen started," Sophie declared.

"Alright."

Within moments, servers began bringing out steaming platters. Sophie guided Evelyn to their table. "That dress is stunning on you," Sophie remarked, eyes twinkling. "This wasn't your idea, was it?"

Evelyn's fingers brushed the silky fabric self-consciously. "Adrian picked it out."

"I knew it! I'm definitely befriending that man - he has impeccable taste," Sophie decided, admiring the emerald green gown that complemented Evelyn's complexion perfectly.

"He's scarily good at this," Evelyn admitted, wincing slightly as she adjusted her heels. Adrian had insisted on the strappy stilettos that now pinched her feet.

"Evelyn, maybe you should remind Adrian that Dominic doesn't hold his liquor well," Lucas interjected, watching the drinking contest with concern.

"Whose side are you on?" Sophie shot back.

"Ours, obviously! But what if he gets alcohol poisoning?" Lucas gestured toward the bar where empty bottles were piling up. "They've gone through a whole case in half an hour!"

Evelyn started to rise, but Sophie caught her wrist.

"Darling, Dominic isn't alone. Lucas and Nathan are there - they'll look after him." Sophie's grip tightened meaningfully. "Besides, he's got a girlfriend now. Your concern is... unnecessary."

The words hit Evelyn like cold water. She sank back into her chair.

At the bar, Lucas and Nathan were intercepting most of the drinks meant for Dominic. Adrian suddenly grabbed Nathan's arm. "Let's have a proper duel, Cross!"

As Adrian dragged Nathan away, the energy at Dominic's table noticeably dimmed. Without Adrian's instigation, the others lacked the courage to challenge the Blackwood Group CEO.

No one dared test him directly.

Lucas raised his glass with a chuckle. "To new beginnings!"

The drinking resumed at a more civilized pace.

Evelyn exhaled in relief as Adrian departed. She picked up her fork, finally able to focus on her meal. "Evelyn, did you like my gift?" Sophie asked between bites.

Evelyn laughed. "That photo album? How did you even collect so many embarrassing pictures of me?"

Sophie grinned wickedly. "A best friend's duty is blackmail material."

The conversation flowed easily, though Evelyn's gaze kept drifting toward the bar where Dominic sat, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the golden lighting. She quickly looked away each time, reminding herself of Sophie's words.

He wasn't her concern anymore.
###Chapter 249

Sophie handed Evelyn the photo album, its pages brimming with memories from their university days.

Evelyn's fingers traced the edges of the photographs, her heart swelling with nostalgia. "You kept all these?" she murmured, flipping through snapshots of late-night study sessions, impromptu road trips, and laughter-filled dorm room gatherings.

Sophie grinned, nudging Evelyn's shoulder playfully. "Of course! What are best friends for? Half this album is just you, anyway." She raised her glass, the amber liquid catching the dim lighting. "To forever friendships!"

Evelyn clinked her glass against Sophie's, the crystal ringing softly. "Forever," she echoed, taking a small sip before setting it down.

A warm hand landed on her shoulder, and she turned to see Lucas standing there, his cheeks flushed from drink. "Miss Thorne," he said, gesturing to the adjacent table where Dominic and the other executives sat, "you should join us. Your team is relentless—we're getting slaughtered over here." His expression was so pitiful Evelyn almost laughed.

Sophie smirked. "Oh please, Lucas. You used to outdrink everyone back in the day."

Lucas sighed dramatically, rubbing his temple. "That was before my liver started sending me warning letters."

Evelyn hesitated, but curiosity won out. She followed Lucas to the other table, where he promptly gestured for her to take the empty seat beside Dominic.

Dominic's sharp gaze locked onto her the moment she approached. His dark eyes were unreadable, but the tension in his jaw was unmistakable.

She sat, trying to ignore the way his presence made the air feel heavier.

"Here, Miss Thorne," Lucas said, pouring her a glass of sparkling juice. He glanced at Dominic. "Would you like some?"

Dominic didn't answer. Instead, he lifted his whiskey glass and took a slow, deliberate sip, his eyes never leaving Evelyn.

Lucas awkwardly set the juice pitcher down.

One of the managers, sensing the tension, stood abruptly. "Miss Thorne, happy birthday! A toast to you!"

Evelyn blinked. "It's not my birthday," she said, sipping her juice. The manager faltered, his glass still raised in midair.

Dominic suddenly stood, his voice rough. "I'll drink with you."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, shooting Lucas a pointed look. Why was Dominic making this her problem?

Lucas discreetly pulled out his phone and typed a message. A second later, Evelyn's phone buzzed.

(He keeps staring at your dress. Guess he wasn’t expecting you to wear something like that.)

Evelyn typed back, her fingers tapping harder than necessary. (I’ll wear whatever I want. If he doesn’t like it, he can leave.)

Lucas replied quickly. (Not saying you shouldn’t. Just ignore him. Let him drink himself into a stupor if he wants.)

She set her phone down with a quiet thud. Dominic’s gaze flickered between her and Lucas, his expression darkening. He knew they were talking about him.

With another sip of whiskey, he suddenly addressed the table. "Do any of you know what the most important thing is about running a company?"

The executives exchanged confused glances. Was this a pop quiz?

Evelyn stared at him, baffled. Was he drunk? Or was she?

Dominic tugged at his collar, his skin flushed. "Starting a company is easy. Keeping it alive? That’s the real challenge. You need strategy. Discipline." His voice was low, commanding.

The managers set their drinks down, listening intently.

Lucas sent another message. (He’s warning you. Thinks you’ll run Thornfield into the ground.)

Evelyn’s grip tightened on her glass. Her face burned—whether from anger or something else, she wasn’t sure.
###Chapter 250

Dominic suddenly grasped Evelyn's fingers. Her phone clattered onto the table as he abruptly released her.

Lucas had been right - this entire speech was aimed directly at her. The executives exchanged stunned glances.

Oh God. Was something brewing between them? Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks. She gulped down the entire glass of juice before her.

Thank heavens today wasn't her actual birthday. What a delightful present - a corporate lecture on her special day, Evelyn thought bitterly. Dominic kept droning on about business strategies between sips of whiskey.

He seemed to have completely forgotten whose celebration this was supposed to be.

Evelyn had consumed two plates of pasta and a bowl of fruit salad. An hour later, he was still pontificating. She massaged her temples and glared at him.

Dominic cleared his throat, locking eyes with her. "Evelyn, did you take notes on everything I said?"

"Let's drink!" Evelyn avoided his gaze, pouring herself a generous measure before filling his glass. "After all this time, we've never shared a proper toast!"

Before Dominic could respond, she'd already drained her glass.

At the neighboring table, Sophie gasped dramatically. "Evelyn's lost her mind!"

Adrian murmured to Sophie, "Looks like Evelyn's the one taking Dominic down tonight - not Mike, certainly not the executives."

As he spoke, they watched Dominic raise his glass and finish it in one go. Sophie's eyes widened. "What are they playing at?"

Adrian smirked. "It's obvious. There's either unresolved tension or pure animosity between them."

"They'll never reconcile. Not with Zoe in the picture... and Sophia... Even if Evelyn's gone mad, she'd never..." Sophie trailed off with a dismissive wave.

The drinking continued for another thirty minutes.

Dominic was thoroughly intoxicated, and Evelyn wasn't far behind. She pressed her fingertips to her throbbing temples, fighting to stay conscious.

Mike remained the only sober one. He dragged Lucas away for another round - clearly he'd intended to get everyone drunk tonight!

At 10:30 pm, Zoe appeared in the banquet hall, her stilettoes clicking sharply against marble. The sound made Evelyn look up. Their eyes met.

"Happy Birthday, Miss Thorne." Zoe towered over Evelyn, looking down her nose. "I'm here for Dominic."

Evelyn's alcohol-fogged brain struggled to form words. She managed only a weak hand gesture in response.

"Miss Thorne, how could you let him get this drunk? You know his health condition!" Zoe scolded while signaling the driver to help Dominic up. "I thought you cared about him, given your history!"

They couldn't maneuver Dominic to the car in his state. Zoe had no choice but to book a room. As soon as the driver deposited Dominic on the bed, Zoe retrieved the vial Julian had given her. Tonight was her chance.

Lucas had texted: (Not my intention, Miss Thorne. Let him drink if he wants. Just humor him.)

Evelyn set her phone down sharply. Dominic's gaze flickered between her and Lucas - he knew they'd been discussing him.

He took a measured sip before announcing, "Do any of you understand what truly sustains a business?"

The executives exchanged confused glances. Had they accidentally wandered into a corporate workshop?

Evelyn blinked owlishly. She couldn't tell who was drunker - herself or Dominic.

His face swam before her eyes as he loosened his tie with uncharacteristic clumsiness.

"Starting a company is simple. Maintaining it? That's the real challenge..." Dominic continued his impromptu lecture.

The executives set down their drinks, listening with forced attentiveness.

Lucas texted Evelyn: (He's warning you. Worried you'll bankrupt yourself.)

Evelyn's cheeks burned as she read the message.
###Chapter 251

"Dominic, drink some water." Zoe Montgomery adjusted his pillow and held the bottle to his lips. "You must feel terrible. This will help."

Back in the banquet hall, Evelyn Thorne was painfully sober. It was worse than being drunk. She knew she couldn't keep getting tangled up with Dominic Blackwood. Nothing good would come of it.

"Zoe is such a pretentious witch!" Sophie Mercer huffed, coming to Evelyn's side. "Don't listen to a word she says. She should take a long look in the mirror first."

Evelyn grabbed her purse, ready to leave. "I'm not mad at her. I'm mad at myself."

"You didn't do anything wrong," Sophie insisted.

"I'm being delusional," Evelyn muttered, more to herself than to Sophie. "Part of me still thinks there's a chance for us... Sophie, slap me if you ever catch me near him again."

Sophie nodded firmly. She only wanted what was best for her friend. "Come on, I'll drive you home," she said, looping an arm around Evelyn. "Don't worry about the others—Adrian will handle everything."

As they stepped into the elevator, Evelyn spotted Dominic's car parked below. "Oh, look at you," Sophie teased, noticing where Evelyn's gaze had landed. "Can't even resist staring at his car. Pathetic." She smirked before adding, "Relax, I heard Zoe booked a room here. Dominic's too wasted tonight—nothing's happening between them."

"Was that little detail really necessary?" Evelyn shot back.

"Buckle up, buttercup," Sophie quipped, starting the engine. "Get some rest tonight, Ev. You deserve better."

Evelyn felt a pang of warmth at her friend's words. Just as she was about to respond, her phone rang. Mrs. Wilkins's name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn hesitated but answered. Before she could speak, a heart-wrenching sob crackled through the line.

It was Sophia, crying uncontrollably. Sophie, about to pull out of the parking lot, froze at the sound.

"Evelyn, I couldn't reach Master Dominic," Mrs. Wilkins said, voice strained. "I had no choice but to call you. Sophia's been crying for him all day. She won't calm down. Is he still at the party? Could you please tell him?"

Of course this would happen the moment Evelyn vowed to cut ties with him forever.

"Tell her no," Sophie whispered urgently.

Evelyn opened her mouth, but the words stuck in her throat. Sophia's cries were unbearable.

"I'll get him," Evelyn said firmly before hanging up.

Sophie groaned. "Evelyn—"

"I'll take a cab later. Go home and rest, Soph," Evelyn said, already stepping out of the car. Though her eyes were red and her voice rough, her resolve was clear. "I know what I'm doing."

The door shut behind her.

As Sophie watched Evelyn stride back into the hotel, she remembered Adrian's warning: Either they reconcile, or they become enemies for life.

Evelyn approached the front desk. "What room is Zoe Montgomery in?"

"V906," the receptionist replied.

Evelyn took a steadying breath and pressed the doorbell. Silence.

She tried again. Nothing.

Just as she turned to leave, the door creaked open. Dominic stood there, shirt misbuttoned, his skin flushed from alcohol. A migraine had his brows knitted together.

Then his bloodshot eyes locked onto her.

In one swift motion, he yanked her into his arms.

###Chapter 252

Evelyn's nose throbbed with sharp pain as Dominic crushed her face against his chest. She blinked through her tears, scanning the dimly lit room with her reddened nose.

Where was Zoe? Why was Dominic alone in this suite? Hadn't she been tasked with looking after her intoxicated lover?

Evelyn shoved against his chest, but Dominic only tightened his grip, his arms like steel bands around her.

"Don't leave me, Evelyn..." His voice was raw as he lifted her effortlessly off the ground. "I've missed you... every damn day..."

The words slurred from his lips as he carried her toward the bed. Her heart clenched at the sight of him—completely wrecked by alcohol. They said drunken confessions held sober truths.

Did that mean he still carried a torch for her?

His weight pressed her into the mattress, his gaze burning into hers with unsettling intensity. "Let me go, Dominic Blackwood!" Evelyn gasped, palms flattening against his stubbled cheeks. "Sophia's crying at home—Mrs. Wilkins called me. She needs you—"

His mouth crashed onto hers, swallowing her protests.

Had he just ignored Sophia's name? Since when did he disregard his twin sister's distress? Normally, just hearing her name would send him into a panic. What had changed tonight?

Evelyn bit down hard. The metallic tang of blood bloomed between them.

"Dominic!" She wrenched her face away, tears spilling hot down her cheeks. "Sophia needs you! Are you even listening? She's waiting for you!"

Dominic licked his bleeding lip, his own tears now falling onto her skin. "I heard you," he rasped, voice gravelly with emotion. "But I'm not leaving. Not tonight. I'm staying right here with you."

Her resistance shattered.

Their lips met again, desperate and hungry. Evelyn stopped fighting. The image of his tear-streaked face haunted her—it hurt too much to push him away.

How had they come to this?

Zoe returned, clutching a shopping bag from an upscale boutique.

As she stepped into the suite, muffled moans slithered from the bedroom.

The bag slipped from her fingers, thudding onto the plush carpet. Her breath hitched. Impossible. She crept toward the half-open door, pulse hammering.

The scene inside stole her breath.

Dominic—drunk, reckless Dominic—was tangled in the sheets with Evelyn. Again.

Zoe's nails dug into her palms. Rage darkened her vision. How she longed to storm in, yank Evelyn's hair, and fling her into the hallway.

But Dominic was on top of her. And despite his intoxication, his grip looked unbreakable.

She couldn't intervene. Not yet.

Helpless, Zoe could only watch, tears streaming silently down her face. The injustice burned. Every instinct screamed at her to leave, but she remained rooted.

Everything had to proceed according to plan.

One misstep, and months of meticulous scheming would unravel. Jaw clenched, Zoe eased the door shut with trembling fingers.
###Chapter 253

Evelyn couldn't bear to listen any longer.

The sounds coming from Dominic's suite were a cruel reminder - no matter what title she held, his heart would always belong to Evelyn Thorne.

She collapsed onto the plush sofa, feeling as if part of her soul had withered away. Her body turned to ice as she sat motionless.

At precisely 2:07 AM, the bedroom door finally creaked open. Evelyn emerged, her movements sluggish as if carrying the weight of the world.

Her blood ran cold when she spotted Zoe waiting in the sitting area.

"How was my boyfriend, Miss Thorne?" Zoe's voice quivered with barely contained fury, her eyes burning with accusation. "Twenty minutes. That's all it took for you to sneak in like some common whore while he was vulnerable!"

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain, but no words came. What defense could possibly justify this betrayal?

The irony wasn't lost on her - she'd become the very thing she despised.

"I'm so sorry," Evelyn whispered, her voice breaking.

"Sorry?" Zoe let out a bitter laugh as tears streamed down her cheeks. "I waited until after your divorce! I've never wronged you, Evelyn. Why would you do this to me?"

The apology died on Evelyn's lips as she approached Zoe. "There are no excuses."

"Here's what's going to happen," Zoe hissed, wiping her tears with violent swipes. "We'll pretend tonight never occurred. You'll tell no one - especially not Dominic. And I'll handle his memory when he wakes." A cruel smirk twisted her lips. "Who knows? He might not even remember your pathetic little tryst."

Evelyn nodded numbly. "Understood."

Stepping into the hotel corridor, the night air sliced through her like a blade. She wrapped her arms around herself, tilting her face toward the moon as if it could cleanse her shame.

The confusion and guilt threatened to consume her, yet she couldn't share this burden with a single soul. Sinking onto the curb, Evelyn couldn't bring herself to go home or even book another room.

Dawn would come soon enough. Perhaps with it, some semblance of redemption.

At 8:03 AM in Suite V906, Dominic awoke to a skull-splitting hangover. His bleary eyes scanned the unfamiliar luxury suite before landing on the woman beside him.

The raven-haired beauty had a distinctive beauty mark on her left shoulder blade - a dark contrast against her porcelain skin.

Memories came flooding back. Evelyn had come to him last night, and he'd lost all control...

But where was she now?

As he dressed with mechanical precision, the sheets rustled behind him. Zoe stretched languidly, offering a sleepy smile. "Morning, darling. Come back to bed?"

Dominic froze. Every muscle in his body locked as shock and horror crashed over him in waves.

Zoe? Had he mistaken Zoe for Evelyn?

"Dominic?" Zoe's voice trembled as she clutched the sheets to her chest. "Last night...you brought me here yourself. I would never have presumed..."

His hands clenched into white-knuckled fists. "I owe you an apology."

The realization hit him like a freight train - he'd confused the two women in his drunken stupor. How could he have made such an unforgivable error?

"Don't be silly," Zoe purred, blinking back manufactured tears. "We're together now. This was...inevitable, wasn't it?"

Internally, Zoe reveled in her victory. Dominic's confusion confirmed her suspicions - he truly didn't remember Evelyn's presence last night.

Checkmate, Evelyn Thorne. You've lost him for good.
###Chapter 254

"I apologize, Dr. Montgomery," Dominic said, forcing his voice back into its usual icy composure. His momentary lapse of control was gone, replaced by the cold detachment he was known for. "It was a mistake. I need to clear my head."

Without another word, he turned and walked out, leaving Zoe standing there, stunned.

She had expected her tears to break through his defenses, to make him pull her into his arms and whisper reassurances.

But no.

He had just… left.

Like she meant nothing.

He hadn’t been like this last night with Evelyn.

Zoe wiped her cheeks roughly, swallowing the bitter taste of rejection. At least there was one silver lining—she had succeeded in her plan. She snatched her phone from the nightstand and dialed Julian’s number.

"It’s done," she said flatly.

"Congratulations, Dr. Montgomery!" Julian’s laughter rang through the line. "Let me know if you need anything else. I’m always happy to assist."

His cheerful tone made her stomach twist. If only Dominic showed even half of Julian’s eagerness to please her.

"Tell me," Zoe demanded, her voice sharp. "Do I look like a man to you? Your uncle didn’t even glance my way. Not even when I was completely bare in front of him."

Julian burst into louder laughter. "My uncle’s the one with the problem, Dr. Montgomery! He’s the one who needs therapy, not you."

Zoe clenched her jaw. It felt like mockery. "He was perfectly normal last night with Evelyn," she snapped.

Julian’s laughter faded into a low hum. "Ah… well, no man can resist Evelyn. She’s got that dangerous mix of innocence and temptation."

"So you’re saying I’m not as attractive?" Zoe hissed.

"No, no! You’re gorgeous, Dr. Montgomery! Stunning, really. It’s just… men tend to prefer Evelyn’s type—soft but seductive, you know?"

Zoe hung up before he could finish.

She didn’t need to hear more.

She already knew Evelyn was younger, prettier, more everything.

But she didn’t need Dominic’s heart.

She just needed him to be hers.

In another suite of the Oceanview Grand Hotel, Nathan stirred awake, his hands patting the sheets blindly.

"Where the hell are my glasses?" he muttered, squinting at the blurry shapes around him.

Then his fingers brushed against warm skin.

He froze.

"Who’s there?" he demanded, voice tight with panic.

He’d drunk too much last night. The memories were a haze.

A groan came from beside him, followed by a lazy kick.

"Why are you up so early?" Lucas grumbled, rolling over. "It’s the weekend."

Nathan ignored him, still searching for his glasses. "Where did you put them?"

"Why would I take your glasses?" Lucas yawned. "Just ask nicely. Say please."

Nathan’s patience snapped. He shoved Lucas off the bed.

"You shameless bastard!" Nathan snarled. "What the hell are you doing in my bed?"

Lucas hit the floor with a thud, then scrambled up, grabbing Nathan’s collar. "Me? You’re the one who crawled in here last night! I was too drunk to remember anything!"

They tumbled back onto the mattress, wrestling like teenagers.

Evelyn woke to the shrill ring of her phone.

She was still curled on the bus stop bench, her body stiff from the cold night air. Her fingers trembled as she fumbled for her phone, pressing it to her ear.

Her skin burned.

She had a fever.

"Evelyn," Lucas’s voice crackled through the line, thick with drama. "They beat me up again! I accidentally slept with Nathan last night because I was drunk! How is this my fault?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly, her head pounding.

"If you’re innocent," she said flatly, "call the police."

###Chapter 255

Dominic coughed roughly, his voice strained. "There's no need to involve the police! Evelyn, where are you right now? You sound exhausted."

Evelyn leaned heavily against the nearby pillar, forcing steadiness into her voice. "I'm at home."

"Were you still asleep? Go back to bed, then. I'm fine—just frustrated. Nathan blames me for everything. He's being completely unreasonable!" Ranting to Evelyn seemed to ease some of the tension coiled in Dominic's chest.

Evelyn hailed a cab and let it carry her home.

She swallowed a fever pill before collapsing into bed. Clara didn’t get the chance to ask what had happened.

At the Blackwood estate, Dominic remained under the shower’s spray for over an hour. His mind replayed the previous night, unable to reconcile the fact that it had been Zoe in his bed. Dealing with Zoe was simple, but facing Evelyn? That was another matter entirely.

One thing was clearer than ever—he was still irrevocably in love with Evelyn.

He couldn’t lie to himself anymore. He had never stopped thinking about her.

Stepping out of the bathroom, Dominic nearly collided with Mrs. Wilkins and Sophia. "Master, Sophia waited for you all night," the housekeeper informed him softly.

Right. Evelyn had come to his room last night, telling him to go home to Sophia. The memory sent a sharp pang through his chest. Had it really been her?

He remembered her presence vividly—her touch, her voice, the way she had looked at him.

So how had Zoe ended up in his bed?

"I couldn’t reach you last night, so I called Evelyn for help. She promised to find you, but you never came home… She must not have succeeded," Mrs. Wilkins explained.

Sophia had cried until three in the morning, exhausting both herself and the housekeeper.

Dominic’s breath caught. His gaze dropped. "She found me. I heard her telling me to come home."

Mrs. Wilkins sighed. "You must have been too drunk to move. I’ll fetch you some aspirin."

Once she left, Dominic turned to Sophia. Her eyes were still puffy from crying. "Sophia, why were you crying last night? Did you miss me?"

Sophia shook her head, her small hands clutching the hem of her nightgown. "I was scared… They hurt me."

Dominic pulled her into his arms. "Did you have a nightmare? They’re gone now. I’ll protect you, Sophia. No one will ever hurt you again."

"But… you weren’t here last night," she whispered, fresh tears spilling over.

Dominic’s chest tightened. "I’m so sorry."

Once Sophia fell asleep, Dominic dressed quickly. The line between dream and reality blurred in his mind. He needed to see Evelyn.

At Mooncrest Manor, a sleek black Rolls-Royce idled at the gates. Clara bolted the entrance the moment she spotted the car.

"Grandma, why did you lock the door?" Lily asked, confused.

Clara’s expression darkened. "Dominic Blackwood is outside. Do not open that door, understand?"

Lily nodded vigorously before darting off to find her brother.

Dominic stared at the locked gates. He pulled out his phone and dialed Evelyn’s number.
###Chapter 256

"Sorry, the number you have dialed cannot be reached, please try again later."

Evelyn had turned off her phone completely.

Dominic's expression darkened. Though they were physically separated by just a door, the distance between them felt immeasurable.

Both Lily and Henry were home when Evelyn mentioned Dominic's arrival. The moment Henry heard, he dashed to his room to grab his drone.

"Henry! What are you doing?" Lily's eyes widened in confusion as she watched her brother.

"I'm driving him away!"

"Oh! Can I help?" Lily clapped her hands excitedly.

Henry handed her a flexible hose connected to the indoor faucet.

Dominic stood resolutely outside the mansion gates, his determination to see Evelyn today unshaken.

Twenty minutes later, a sleek drone descended from the second-floor balcony.

When the bodyguard spotted the aircraft, his brows furrowed. "What the hell is that?"

This wasn't any ordinary drone - it carried a hose attachment and was flying straight toward them.

Dominic looked up just as the colorful drone hovered overhead.

A sharp beep sounded before water began spraying downward.

"Shit!" The bodyguard immediately tried pulling Dominic toward the car. "That spiteful Evelyn! How dare she-"

Dominic shook him off. "This isn't her doing. She'd never resort to something so juvenile."

Though he couldn't see the operator, Dominic knew immediately - this had Henry written all over it. If the boy could hack complex systems, piloting a drone would be child's play.

The drone mirrored Dominic's movements, dousing him relentlessly until his designer suit clung to his frame.

"I'm going in there!" the bodyguard growled.

"Stand down!" Dominic commanded.

Barging in would only worsen Clara's opinion of him, and he couldn't risk further alienating Evelyn's family.

"That little bastard Henry! I'll teach him a lesson next time!" The bodyguard rummaged frantically for an umbrella, coming up empty-handed.

From the first-floor window, Clara witnessed the scene unfolding outside and rushed upstairs.

"Henry! Bring that drone back immediately!"

Henry's small fingers tightened around the controller.

Lily giggled, holding the hose. "Grandma, we're chasing away the bad man!"

Clara shut off the water supply and fixed Henry with a stern look. "If you don't recall that drone right now, I'm telling your mother."

Though Clara wanted Dominic gone, she couldn't condone such behavior from the children.

With a frustrated sigh, Henry guided the drone home while Clara peered through the balcony doors.

Dominic stood dripping, his bodyguard patting him down with tissues.

Clara's lips pressed into a thin line. Should she apologize for the children's actions? The dilemma twisted her stomach.

###Chapter 257 

"Mr. Blackwood, we should leave!" The bodyguard's voice held urgency. "Your clothes are soaked through. You'll catch your death out here."

Though the autumn sun shone brightly, a biting chill had settled in the air.

Dominic remained motionless, his voice steady. "I'm fine."

Recognizing his employer's stubbornness, the bodyguard resigned himself to waiting in silence.

The crunch of tires on gravel announced an approaching vehicle. A crimson Porsche Cayenne pulled alongside them, its window descending to reveal Mike's surprised face.

"What in the world are you doing here?" Mike's eyes widened at Dominic's drenched appearance. "Did a storm roll through?"

The bodyguard shot him a glare. "That little demon Henry did this!"

Mike whistled low. "Damn, that kid's got more nerve than I ever did!"

When Dominic remained silent, Mike exited the vehicle with exaggerated flair. "You two look ridiculous standing here like drowned rats. Come inside before you freeze solid!"

After a brief hesitation, Dominic followed.

Mike punched in the security code with theatrical precision.

Clara's expression darkened when she saw Dominic trailing behind Mike, but she held her tongue.

"Just letting him borrow some dry clothes," Mike assured her. "You can kick him out afterward if you want."

With Clara's reluctant nod, Mike led Dominic upstairs.

Lily and Henry heard the approaching footsteps and stationed themselves like tiny sentinels outside their mother's bedroom door.

"We won't let him hurt Mom again," Henry whispered fiercely to his sister.

Dominic's sharp gaze immediately found the children guarding what could only be Evelyn's room. Their defensive postures told him everything.

Yet he didn't approach.

"Your assistant's a real piece of work," Mike complained as they entered his room. "And your CFO? They ambushed me like common thugs! This cut barely healed and now it's bleeding again!"

The children exhaled in relief when Dominic disappeared into Mike's room. Slipping into their mother's bedroom, they found Evelyn shivering violently beneath the blankets.

Henry pressed a small hand to her forehead. "She's burning up!"

"Stay with Mom," he ordered Lily before racing downstairs.

When Clara saw Evelyn's condition, her face drained of color. "Mike!" Her voice carried through the house. "We need to get Evelyn to the hospital now!"

Dominic moved faster than either of them expected, shouldering past Mike to reach Evelyn first.

Disoriented with fever, Evelyn barely registered being lifted from the bed. The medicine should have helped—why did she feel worse?

"What happened? She was fine this morning!" Mike trailed after Dominic.

"Stay with the children," Dominic instructed Clara as he carried Evelyn toward his Rolls-Royce.

The bodyguard already had the engine running.

Left standing in the driveway, Mike could only watch the luxury vehicle speed away. "Did he just abduct my sister?" he muttered to the empty air.
###Chapter 258

"Dominic, hurry! Don't let them get away!" Clara's voice was sharp with urgency.

Dominic blinked, snapping out of his momentary hesitation before flooring the accelerator.

Clara exhaled, relief washing over her.

"Grandma, is Mommy going to be okay? I'm scared!" Lily's small fingers clutched at Clara's sleeve, her eyes brimming with tears.

Clara lifted her into her arms. "Sweetheart, your mom just has a fever. The doctors will take good care of her, and she'll be fine once the fever breaks."

"But... why was Dominic here?" Lily frowned, a knot of unease tightening in her chest.

Clara's expression darkened. "I don't know, but I doubt he'd try anything while she's sick."

Despite her deep-seated distrust of Dominic, she couldn't deny the way he had carefully wrapped Evelyn in a blanket before carrying her out.

The smallest gestures often revealed the truth. No matter how many women he had in his life, his concern for Evelyn was undeniable.

At least for now, Evelyn was safe with him.

The emergency room was chaotic when they arrived.

Dominic carried Evelyn inside, his grip firm yet gentle. By the time Julian caught up, Evelyn was already hooked to an IV.

"Dominic Blackwood! You move like a damn cheetah!" Julian panted, glaring. "Give her back!"

The emergency room had no available beds, so Dominic kept Evelyn cradled in his arms. He shot Julian an icy look. "Get out of my way."

"Your way? If you hadn’t shoved me aside, I would’ve brought her here!" Julian planted his hands on his hips, defiance flashing in his eyes.

The surrounding patients turned to stare.

"Trying to make the front page tomorrow?" Dominic hissed. "Shut up."

Julian glanced around, reluctantly lowering his voice before slumping into the seat beside Dominic.

"Why is everyone around you so damn violent?" Julian gingerly touched the bruise at his mouth. "I was drunk last night, and someone threw me in a room with Nathan. Like it was my fault."

Dominic gave him a sidelong glance. Julian’s fair skin made the bruise stand out starkly.

"Why didn’t you fight back?" Dominic asked dryly.

"Two against one? Seriously?"

"Ever heard of calling the police?"

Julian groaned. "Ugh, Evelyn said the same thing."

"It’s not even that bad," Julian muttered. "But Nathan? That snake better hope I don’t catch him alone."

Dominic’s eyes narrowed. "Stay away from Nathan."

Julian scoffed. "Oh, I’m the problem? You’re the one juggling three women at once! Compared to you, I’m practically a saint!"

His voice rose again, drawing more stares.

Dominic’s jaw tightened. With a single glance, his bodyguard hauled Julian out of the room.

Silence settled at last.

Soon, a nurse guided Dominic to a private room. He laid Evelyn down, brushing a hand over her forehead.

Her fever was easing.

His frown deepened as he studied her pale face. After a moment, he stepped onto the balcony and dialed a number.

Zoe Montgomery barely paused when she got home.

Straight to the study—she had work to do. Finding Sophia’s former doctor was priority one, but so was researching potential treatments.

A knock interrupted her.

"Come in," she called.

At home, only her bodyguard and housekeeper ever disturbed her.

The bodyguard entered, his expression grim as he approached.
###Chapter 259

"Dr. Montgomery, Mr. Blackwood instructed me to deliver this to you." The security guard extended a crisp check toward Zoe.

Zoe accepted the slip of paper, her eyes scanning the staggering amount before letting out a derisive laugh.

"How remarkably generous! One night together and I'm worth five million dollars." She placed the check on the mahogany desk with trembling fingers, her smile bitter. "Did he have any other messages for me?"

The guard remained stone-faced as he shook his head.

A sharp pain lanced through Zoe's chest. "What does Dominic take me for? Some high-class call girl? Though I suppose the only difference is my price tag is significantly higher!"

Her medical textbook hit the floor with a resounding thud. "Does that man understand basic human decency?"

"Dr. Montgomery, you're receiving more consideration than most," the guard replied impassively. "Under different circumstances, you wouldn't see a single cent."

"Only because I'm still useful to him!" she spat, her eyes blazing crimson.

The guard adjusted his tie. "Precisely. Otherwise, you'd have been removed from the premises weeks ago. Miss Thorne never demands compensation from Mr. Blackwood. She understands her place."

"So now I'm the greedy one?" Zoe's voice cracked.

"You'd do well to focus your efforts on pleasing Madam Eleanor," the guard advised before exiting.

The words struck Zoe like lightning. She suddenly understood - she'd crossed an invisible line the moment she'd dared ask Dominic for commitment.

The guard was right. She needed to tread carefully and redirect her approach.

Meanwhile at St. Elizabeth Medical Center, Evelyn's fever had finally broken. She stirred awake, blinking at the unfamiliar hospital room before her gaze landed on the imposing figure seated beside her bed.

Dominic watched her with unreadable intensity.

"Why is he here? How did I end up in the hospital?" Her mind raced.

"I—" Her voice emerged as a ragged whisper, her throat burning as if lined with broken glass.

Without a word, Dominic filled a glass with water, gently supporting her back as he brought it to her lips. The cool liquid soothed her throat, triggering fragmented memories of the previous night.

"More?" His deep voice rumbled.

Evelyn shook her head, pulling the blanket tighter around herself. "Why are you here? Who brought me in?"

The room held only the two of them. While Dominic might have been her rescuer, the night remained a blur.

"Mike's waiting outside." Dominic's chest constricted at the wariness in her eyes. "Evelyn, I came to ask you something important."

Her expression remained carefully neutral. "Oh? What about?"

"Did you come looking for me last night?" His piercing gaze missed nothing, cataloging every microexpression. "I remember you saying—"

"No." Her interruption was swift and decisive. "I had too much to drink last night and wasn't feeling well. Why would I seek you out?"

"Are you certain?" His Adam's apple bobbed. "You mentioned Sophia was crying."

"If you remember so clearly, why ask me? This only proves your memory's unreliable," Evelyn countered smoothly, maintaining her facade.

Dominic stood abruptly, all emotion draining from his chiseled features.

"In that case, my apologies for disturbing you." His voice turned glacial.

Evelyn's heart clenched, but she schooled her features into perfect indifference.

"Was there some significance to last night that prompted this interrogation?" She feigned casual curiosity, expecting him to storm out.

Instead, Dominic locked eyes with her and delivered his bombshell: "I slept with Zoe Montgomery. Would you consider that significant?"

###Chapter 260

Evelyn's gaze flickered away momentarily before she let out a soft, mocking laugh. "Is this really the first time you two have slept together? It's been ages since you went public with your relationship. How... quaint."

Dominic's expression turned stormy. "You speak as if you're an expert. Have there been other men besides me?"

Her lips curved into a teasing smile. "Naturally."

Henry was technically a "man," after all.

The tension in Dominic's jaw eased slightly.

"Evelyn Thorne! I swear to God, if I ever come looking for you again—" He bit out the words, his voice low and dangerous, before turning on his heel and slamming the door behind him.

Evelyn watched him leave, her smile crumbling the moment he was gone.

This was good. He wouldn’t seek her out again. They could finally move on.

So why did her chest ache so much?

She clutched the blanket tighter, inhaling deeply. It still carried his scent—spice and something uniquely him.

The door burst open, and Mike strode in, his expression livid.

"Evelyn, did that bastard do something to you? I was supposed to take you to the hospital, but he got there first!" He marched to the bed, pressing a hand to her forehead. The fever had broken, her skin cool beneath his touch.

"Dominic brought me here?" Her voice trembled.

"Yeah! He showed up at your place looking for you, and Henry drenched him with a bucket of water. The man was soaked to the bone. I let him change inside, and that’s when we realized you were burning up." Mike scowled. "What did he say just now? He looked ready to murder someone when he left."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Nothing important. Why is my blanket here?"

"Dominic carried it over. The guy’s built like a damn tank—I could barely keep up while he was holding you."

She didn’t want to hear another word about him. Her eyes flicked to the IV bag. "There's one more dose left. I'm going to rest."

"Sleep. I’ll keep watch." Mike adjusted the covers around her.

Three days later, Thornfield Industries’ sales department received an unprecedented order.

"Blackwood Group wants five thousand Tempest series drones!" The sales manager double-checked the numbers before rushing to report the news.

Mike snatched the order details and headed straight for Evelyn’s office.

"Blackwood’s purchasing department just placed an order for five thousand Tempest drones," he announced, dropping the papers on her desk. "What the hell do they need that many for?"

Evelyn picked up the order form, scanning the figures.

"Each unit is priced at nineteen thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars. Five thousand units comes to..." She trailed off, doing the math in her head.

"Ninety-nine million nine hundred ninety-five thousand dollars," Mike finished, whistling. "Why don’t we mark it up to twenty grand each? That’s an easy billion-dollar deal right there."

Evelyn blinked. She had been considering a bulk discount.

"You’re not seriously thinking of giving him a break, are you?" Mike scoffed. "Evelyn, do you honestly think Dominic Blackwood cares about money? Don’t insult the man’s ego by implying he needs a discount." He snatched the order back. "This is huge. I’m calling Nathan."

As Mike left, Evelyn’s mind raced. Dominic had to know about this purchase. A billion-dollar order wasn’t something that slipped past him.

Her eyes drifted to the calendar on her desk. The Harvest Festival was coming up.

Was he planning to gift every Blackwood Group employee a drone?

Mike returned, already dialing Nathan on the intercom.
###Chapter 261

Nathan Cross picked up the phone. "Hello."

"It's me."

Nathan glanced at the caller ID and responded icily, "What do you want?"

"Watch your tone, or we might reconsider selling you the drones," Vincent Holloway threatened.

Nathan scoffed. "Get over yourself! Who said we even want your drones?"

Vincent paused. "Your boss, obviously. We just received an order from your purchasing department. Or is this some kind of scam?"

Nathan inhaled sharply. "So you're telling me Dominic instructed the purchasing department to order drones?"

"Exactly. Didn’t you know?" Vincent chuckled mockingly. "And here I thought your boss trusted you. Guess you’re not as important as you thought." He hung up before Nathan could retort.

Furious, Nathan stormed into Dominic Blackwood’s office to verify.

Dominic barely glanced up from his screen. "We give gifts to employees every Harvest Festival. This year, it’s drones. Got a problem with that?"

Nathan stiffened. "No, sir. Just... surprised."

"Decided last night," Dominic said casually. "Even though Evelyn and I aren’t on speaking terms, her company makes decent products." He’d never forget being chased by one of those drones—or getting drenched outside her house days ago.

Technology evolved, and he saw no harm in sharing it with his employees.

Nathan clenched his fists. "Vincent called earlier. I might have been... less than polite. Should I smooth things over?"

Dominic waved a dismissive hand.

Half an hour later, Nathan and the purchasing manager arrived at Thornfield Industries.

Evelyn Thorne and Vincent greeted them in the conference room.

"Five thousand drones by the Harvest Festival?" Vincent crossed his arms. "That’s a massive order. Doubt we can fulfill it in time." He smirked. "Unless you’re willing to make concessions."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. Who does this guy think he is? We’re the clients! Thornfield isn’t the only drone supplier in Eldermere.

"How many can you deliver?" Nathan demanded. "We’ll take what you have and source the rest elsewhere."

Vincent raised a brow. "Is that what your boss said?"

The purchasing manager leaned in, whispering urgently, "Mr. Cross, Mr. Blackwood specifically wants Thornfield’s drones."

Nathan grabbed his water glass, knuckles white.

Vincent continued, "If you insist on five thousand, we’ll pull stock from overseas branches—but the price won’t stay at $19,999 per unit. It’ll increase."

Nathan’s blood boiled. "Hold on. I need to call Dominic."

As he dialed, Evelyn sipped her water calmly.

Vincent wasn’t wrong. Their factories couldn’t produce five thousand drones overnight. Importing stock meant taxes, shipping costs—and higher overseas market prices.

Nathan struggled to stay professional. Clients were supposed to be kings, not beggars.

He relayed the terms to Dominic, voice strained.

"Nathan," Dominic’s voice cut like ice. "Do I look like I can’t afford Evelyn’s drones?"

"Sir, that’s not—they’re extorting us!"

Evelyn tapped the table, gesturing for the phone.

Nathan adjusted his glasses. "Mr. Blackwood, Miss Thorne wants to speak to you."
###Chapter 262

The line went silent as Dominic absorbed the information.

Nathan handed the phone to Evelyn with an awkward expression, and she placed it on the table, switching it to speaker mode.

"Hello, Mr. Blackwood."

Lucas stifled a laugh at Evelyn's overly formal tone, while Nathan remained quiet.

Dominic responded in an equally measured voice, "Hello, Miss Thorne."

Evelyn blinked in surprise.

Lucas reached for his glass of water, only to find it empty. Nathan mirrored the motion, realizing his own glass was dry.

"I want to clarify that we're not intentionally making this difficult," Evelyn said, steadying her voice. "Our factories are newly established, and we currently lack the necessary equipment and manpower. Given the circumstances, fulfilling your order as-is would be impossible. However, we can arrange for a shipment of drones from our overseas suppliers—though they come at a significantly higher price in the international market."

Nathan visibly relaxed at Evelyn's explanation. Though she was saying the same thing as Lucas, Nathan found Lucas's delivery far more grating.

"But since this is our first major domestic order, I’m willing to offer you the imported units at our local pricing," Evelyn continued.

Lucas's eyes widened. "Why are we giving Dominic a discount?"

Nathan, however, exhaled in relief.

This is how you show sincerity, he thought.

Dominic’s cold voice cut through the phone. "I don’t accept discounts."

The room fell silent. The unspoken implication was clear—Dominic had no interest in charity. He wasn’t someone who needed financial favors.

Lucas quickly changed tactics. "Let me outline the payment terms. We require a fifty percent deposit upfront, with the remaining balance due three days after delivery."

Nathan frowned. "That’s an unusually high deposit."

The purchasing manager nodded in agreement. "Thirty percent is already considered steep. Fifty is excessive."

"Send the invoice. I’ll pay in full immediately," Dominic stated.

Nathan and the purchasing manager exchanged stunned glances.

If this was his decision all along, why even send us here? Nathan thought. It’s obvious he just wanted to funnel money into Evelyn’s company. How transparent.

Once the contract was signed, Evelyn offered to take them to dinner.

Nathan wasn’t in the mood, but the purchasing manager eagerly accepted.

"Why the long face, Mr. Cross? You won’t regret this purchase," Lucas reassured him. "Our drones have the longest battery life on the market, and our AI system outperforms every competitor—"

Nathan raised a hand, cutting him off. "Let’s just eat."

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Group, Lucas had just learned Dominic was about to drop a billion on Thornfield Industries’ drones.

"Dominic, do you actually want those drones, or is this just an excuse to throw money at Evelyn?" Lucas asked bluntly. "Weren’t you the one who swore you’d never see her again after that night of drinking?"

Dominic arched a brow. "Did you question me when I ordered laptops and smartphones in bulk before?"

Lucas considered this. "Fair point. I suppose Evelyn’s drones really are that impressive."

"Did you think Apex Innovations’ sales reports were fabricated?"

Just then, Dominic’s phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID and immediately answered. Taking the hint, Lucas grabbed his coffee and left.

###Chapter 263

"Mr. Blackwood, we've uncovered some intriguing information," the private investigator said, his voice low and measured. Dominic had hired him overseas to track down a specialist who could help Sophia. "It appears Miss Montgomery is also searching for a doctor—a middle-aged man, approximately 1.7 meters tall."

Dominic's jaw tightened. "Why would she be looking for him?"

The investigator leaned forward slightly. "Our theory is she's trying to secure his services for Sophia."

A flicker of hope ignited in Dominic's dark eyes. "Then we find him first."

"There's more," the investigator continued. "Before his death, Professor Whitmore reportedly took on a secret student. The records are heavily classified, but we believe this individual worked closely with him in his private lab."

Dominic's fingers drummed against the desk. "Could this student be the one Zoe is after?"

"That's our assumption as well."

At five o'clock sharp, Dominic arrived at Willowbrook Academy to collect Sophia. As he pulled into the parking lot, his gaze landed on Evelyn, who was there to pick up Henry. The four of them froze for a heartbeat, an unspoken tension thickening the air.

Dominic quickly averted his eyes, helping Sophia into the car. Evelyn, after ensuring Henry was safely buckled in, slid into the driver's seat without a backward glance.

Their cars started simultaneously, turning in unison toward the school gate. The entrance was just wide enough for both vehicles to exit side by side—one veering left, the other right.

Once on the main road, Henry's small voice broke the silence. "Mom, I want to change schools."

Evelyn glanced at him in the rearview mirror. "Which school do you have in mind? Are you ready to be around other kids now?"

Henry stayed quiet, his fingers fidgeting with the strap of his backpack.

Willowbrook wasn't terrible, but Sophia kept peeking into his classroom, her wide eyes following him. He'd only enrolled to uncover the truth about Dominic and Sophia. Now that he had his answers, he wanted out.

"Let's finish the year first," Evelyn suggested gently. "If you still hate it, we can try elementary school next fall. Deal?"

Henry gave a reluctant nod.

Meanwhile, in the other car, Sophia clutched her seatbelt, her head bowed. "Big Brother, can we invite Henry to my birthday party?"

Dominic's voice softened, though his words were firm. "He won't come."

Tears welled in Sophia's eyes. "Why don't they like me? Is it because I'm slow?"

"No," Dominic said roughly. "They don't like you because they hate me."

"But why? You're the best."

Dominic exhaled sharply. "Sophia, just because I'm good to you doesn't mean I've been good to them." He reached over, squeezing her hand. "I'll celebrate your birthday with you."

Half an hour later, the car rolled into the grand driveway of Mooncrest Manor.

After dinner, Mrs. Wilkins led Sophia to the sprawling backyard to pick fresh fruit from the orchard. Sophia adored the garden, where Dominic had planted rows of flowering trees just for her.

Alone in his study, Dominic braced himself against the desk. His father's memorial was in a week, and the nightmares had already begun—violent, suffocating visions that haunted him every year like clockwork.

He crossed to the bookshelf, his fingers brushing against a crimson box tucked between leather-bound volumes. Inside lay his darkest secret. He kept it here deliberately—because the most dangerous hiding places were often the most obvious.

###Chapter 264

The wooden box had occupied that same corner of the shelf for two decades without incident.

Now it had vanished without a trace.

Dominic's blood ran cold when his searching hands found empty space where the heirloom should be.

He yanked every book from the third shelf, sending leather-bound volumes crashing to the study floor. The custom-built shelving unit was secured directly into the wall—no gaps, no crevices for anything to slip through.

Methodically, he combed through each discarded book, shaking them violently as if the missing item might materialize between pages. The shelf stood barren, yet the box remained stubbornly absent.

"Who dared?" His vision tinted crimson as fury surged through his veins. The study was his sanctum—no one entered without explicit permission.

A hazy memory surfaced—he'd glimpsed the box during inventory checks four weeks prior.

Snatching his phone, he barked orders to security. "Pull all surveillance footage from the past month! Someone breached my private study!"

The head of security stammered. "Right away, Mr. Blackwood!"

"Deploy every available analyst to review the recordings immediately!" Dominic commanded, his pulse hammering against his ribs.

Mrs. Wilkins nearly dropped the teacup when she guided Sophia into the parlor and encountered Dominic's thunderous expression.

"Sir? What's happened?"

"My study has been violated," he ground out between clenched teeth.

The housekeeper's hand flew to her mouth.

"Compile a complete visitor log for the past thirty days. I want it on my desk within the hour." Without waiting for acknowledgment, he took Sophia's delicate hand and escorted her upstairs.

The young woman flinched at his uncharacteristic roughness.

Once inside her pastel-hued bedroom, Dominic knelt to her eye level. "Sophia, darling, have you visited my study recently?"

Wide blue eyes blinked in confusion before she shook her head.

"It's alright, sweetheart. Just checking." When she remained silent, he added gently, "Would you help me find something important?"

A tremulous smile curved her lips. "Like hide-and-seek?"

"Exactly like that." He guided her to sit on the lace-covered bed.

Sophia's fingers twisted in her skirt. "I didn't take it..."

"I know, precious." He smoothed her honey-blonde hair, heart constricting at her distress. Sophia's cognitive delays made her painfully vulnerable—another reason he'd dedicated millions to neurological research.

Forcing calm into his voice, he changed tactics. "Your birthday approaches. Tell me what would make you happiest this year."

The tension melted from her shoulders. After prolonged consideration, she whispered, "I want Henry to play tea party with me."

Dominic's jaw tightened. The request involving Evelyn's son complicated matters, but he'd move heaven and earth for his sister's smile. "Consider it done."

Mrs. Wilkins appeared with a parchment list just as he stood.

"The visitor log awaits in your study, sir. Shall I prepare Sophia's evening tonic?"

Nodding curtly, Dominic stalked toward his domain.

Familiar names filled the page, but five stood out: Zoe Montgomery, Evelyn Thorne, Lucas Grant, Henry Thorne, and Lily Thorne. All had accessed the mansion during the critical timeframe.

His fountain pen hovered over Evelyn's name first. Without hesitation, he drew a decisive line through it. Some unshakable instinct—deeper than logic—told him the fiery entrepreneur would never steal from him. The certainty felt as intrinsic as breathing.

Next came Lucas Grant. Dominic scoffed. His CFO had been physically restrained in the foyer by security during their last confrontation. No possibility of him reaching the study.

The remaining three names made his grip tighten around the pen. Someone would pay dearly for this transgression.
###Chapter 265

Dominic's pen hovered over the list as he decisively crossed out Julian's name - and with it, Henry Thorne's as well.

Henry had visited his estate twice, but the boy had never ventured beyond the living room during either visit.

Lily, however, had managed to sneak upstairs once, where she'd been caught by the staff. Yet the child didn't strike him as particularly cunning - if she were, she wouldn't have burst into tears when discovered.

He kept Lily's name on the list but shifted his focus to Zoe Montgomery.

Could it possibly be her?

Every time Zoe came to the mansion, there were always people present. She'd never had an opportunity to slip into the study unnoticed.

With no other leads, Dominic had no choice but to wait for the security footage review.

He'd spent the entire night in the surveillance room, poring over recordings without a moment's rest.

On the day he'd brought Evelyn home, the security system had been compromised, leaving a critical three-hour gap. Previously, he'd only needed to confirm the cameras were operational - now he needed to understand exactly what had gone wrong.

Returning to his bedroom, sleep eluded him completely. The discovery of the missing box had left him feeling as though his chest had been torn open. If only he'd confronted his past demons sooner, he might never have needed to divorce Evelyn.

By noon, his security team had finally completed reviewing the past month's footage.

"Mr. Blackwood," the head guard reported, "we've examined all surveillance outside your study. No one entered besides you and Mrs. Wilkins. Each time Mrs. Wilkins exited, she carried only her cleaning supplies - nothing more."

Dominic closed his eyes in frustration. He'd never suspected Mrs. Wilkins - she'd served him faithfully for years. If she'd wanted to betray him, she'd had countless opportunities before now.

"The cameras malfunctioned the day Miss Thorne brought her children over," the guard suggested cautiously. "Is it possible someone accessed the study during that window?"

Dominic's expression darkened. After dismissing the guard, he immediately called Evelyn.

Seeing his name on her screen, Evelyn assumed it was work-related as she answered, "Dominic?"

"I've lost something," his voice rasped from exhaustion.

The unexpected statement caught her off guard. "What did you lose?"

"It was there a month ago. I've reviewed all the surveillance footage from the past month and found nothing. When you visited my home previously, your son disabled the security cameras - we're missing three hours of footage."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn, making her stomach clench. "Dominic Blackwood, I didn't take anything from you! I wouldn't!"

During their marriage, he'd given her countless expensive gifts - all of which she'd left behind when she moved out.

"I don't suspect you." His heart ached at her defensive tone. "Could you ask your children if they've seen a red wooden box?"

"There's no red box in my home. If they'd taken something from you, they would have told me," she said firmly, closing her laptop. "I'll check when I get home."

"Thank you," he replied heavily.

Hearing the strain in his voice softened Evelyn slightly. "You stayed up all night? Was it something important?"

"Vitally important." He massaged his temples, voice thick with emotion. "If you find that box... please don't open it."

Evelyn swallowed hard. She wanted to comfort him but didn't know how. Perhaps the best comfort would be recovering whatever he'd lost.

She left her office and headed straight for the elevator.

She'd always sensed Dominic was hiding something, but never imagined he'd lose whatever secret that box contained.

She couldn't imagine who might have taken it, but felt certain it wasn't Henry or Lily.

Though the children resented Dominic, stealing wasn't in their nature. Still, Evelyn resolved to search every inch of her home. What if the box was there after all?
###Chapter 266

Evelyn stood in the grand foyer of Mooncrest Manor, her breath catching when Dominic stormed through the front doors. The usually composed billionaire looked uncharacteristically disheveled.

"Dominic, you look exhausted. Have you eaten?" Clara Thorne emerged from the kitchen, wiping her hands on a linen towel.

"Mother, have you noticed a crimson jewelry box in the house?" Evelyn flung her designer handbag onto the plush sofa and marched toward the twins' playroom.

"A jewelry box?" Clara trailed behind, frowning. "I don't recall seeing one. Why do you ask?"

"Dominic misplaced an important box." Evelyn's fingers trembled as she opened the toy chest. "He reviewed all security footage but found nothing unusual. However, Henry hacked into Dominic's security system weeks ago during his visit. Dominic suspects the box disappeared during that window."

Clara's face darkened. "He's accusing Henry of theft?"

Evelyn met her mother's gaze. "I know you don't believe Henry capable of this, and neither do I. But how many boundaries has he crossed already?"

Clara exhaled sharply but didn't argue. "This box - what's inside that makes it so valuable?" She began searching through the bookshelf.

"Dominic says it's crucial." Evelyn's voice wavered as she checked under the bunk beds.

"If it's that important, why wasn't it secured properly?" Clara's brow furrowed. "If a child could simply walk in and take it, the security measures are clearly inadequate."

"His estate has round-the-clock guards and surveillance covering every angle," Evelyn countered. "No ordinary person could breach that level of protection."

Clara fell silent.

After combing through every inch of the playroom, Evelyn expanded her search to the entire mansion.

An hour later, they'd found nothing.

"Evelyn, if he suspects us, let him come search himself." Clara collapsed onto the velvet sofa, exhaustion lining her face.

Evelyn stepped onto the moonlit balcony and dialed Dominic's number.

"The box isn't here," she reported. "When Lily and Henry return from Willowbrook Academy, I'll question them."

"Understood."

"Dominic... what happens if the box isn't found?" Her grip tightened on the phone.

"Nothing consequential." His clipped tone suggested he was withholding something.

"If it's not urgent, get some rest. Sometimes what we search for appears when we stop looking." She tried to sound reassuring.

"Perhaps."

Dominic had turned Blackwood Estate upside down multiple times. The box was undeniably missing.

If Evelyn's children hadn't taken it, who had?

The thief's motives baffled him. The box's contents could destroy him, yet nothing had surfaced. No blackmail. No threats. Just silence.

Lying in his cold bed, Dominic found sleep elusive. The mystery gnawed at him.

That evening, Evelyn inspected Lily and Henry's school bags as soon as they returned. Only textbooks and spare uniforms filled the compartments.

"Mommy, what are you searching for?" Lily blinked her enormous hazel eyes.

"Sweetheart, have either of you taken a red box from Dominic's house?" Evelyn knelt to their eye level. Lily's cheeks instantly flushed crimson, her small hands clutching her skirt.

###Chapter 267

"No," Henry replied evenly.

"Are you absolutely sure?" Evelyn pressed, searching her son's face for any hint of deception.

"No," Henry repeated, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn exhaled, forcing herself to drop the matter. If she kept questioning them, Lily and Henry might think she doubted their honesty.

Henry took Lily's hand and led her to their bedroom to put away their school bags.

Once the door closed behind them, Lily whispered, "Henry, why did we lie? We shouldn't lie to Mom."

Lily had only kept quiet because Evelyn hadn't known—but now that she was asking directly, guilt prickled at her conscience.

"Dominic is probably losing his mind right now, realizing that box is missing," Henry said coolly. "If we give it back now, he’ll just punish us for taking it. Let him sweat a little longer."

"Oh... Okay!" Lily agreed. Between their terrible father and her brother, she would always choose her brother.

They had originally hidden the box under Henry's bed, but after discovering its contents—a single, crucial piece of paper—they had moved it. Two days ago, they buried it beneath the old oak tree in the backyard.

Good thing they did, or it would have been found by now.

"But what if Dominic gets so worried he gets sick?" Lily fretted. "He’s still our dad!"

"Don’t worry," Henry said flatly. "People like him don’t break that easily."

Lily finally relaxed.

After dinner, Evelyn sent Dominic a message: (I asked the kids. They said they didn’t take the box.)

She assumed he was resting, but he replied immediately: (Understood.)

She typed back: (You’re still awake?)

When Dominic read it, he didn’t respond. He didn’t know how to. It had been thirty-six hours since he’d last slept, and exhaustion was gnawing at his sanity.

In the depths of his despair, a bitter thought surfaced: So what if someone exposes what’s in that box? I’ll lose money. Friends will abandon me. And as for love… I’ve already lost that. I’ve made enough to last a lifetime. And friends? They were never real anyway. At least Sophia won’t leave me.

Resigned to the worst, Dominic finally surrendered to exhaustion and fell asleep.

Evelyn waited for his reply, but three days passed with nothing.

Then, during a call with Sophie, she got the news.

"Did you hear? Dominic’s been hospitalized! No one knows why, but he’s refusing to eat. Can you believe it? A man like him, starving himself!" Sophie exclaimed.

Evelyn shot to her feet, her pulse spiking.

No wonder she’d felt uneasy these past few days. She hadn’t realized that box meant so much to him.

I shouldn’t have believed him when he said it wasn’t a big deal. If it wasn’t, he wouldn’t have stayed up all night searching for it.

"How is he now?" Evelyn moved toward the door but stopped short.

"He’s on an IV drip," Sophie said. "Adrian just got back from the hospital. Said Zoe’s been taking care of him. Evelyn, do you want to go see him?"

She did want to. But with Zoe already there, what was the point? Even if she went, Zoe would never let her near him.
###Chapter 268

"You shouldn't go. Sophia is there too, and with those two guarding him, you'll definitely feel provoked," Sophie warned. "Dominic's mental state isn't stable right now. I thought maybe his company was in trouble, but Adrian said everything's fine. I suspect it has something to do with you?"

Evelyn returned to her office chair, sinking into the leather seat. "You're overestimating my influence, Sophie. He didn't break when I divorced him, so I doubt I matter that much."

"Then why is he acting so strange? It can't be because of Zoe, can she?" Sophie muttered, perplexed. "I heard she's been visiting the old Blackwood mansion constantly. That woman schemes like a chess master!"

The more Evelyn heard about Dominic and Zoe, the more unsettled she became. Maybe she could maintain her composure if they married someday.

Dominic and she were like parallel lines - moving in the same direction but never intersecting, destined to grow further apart with time.

"Sophie, how are things with Adrian?" Evelyn changed the subject.

"Same as always! He's giving it until year-end to win my parents over. If they're not satisfied by then, he'll return home to take over the family business," Sophie sighed. "Not everyone has Dominic's business acumen. Maybe Adrian and I are both meant to inherit our family empires."

"You're such a privileged soul."

"As if I could compare to you," Sophie chuckled. "Honestly Evelyn, I'm relieved you're not visiting Dominic at the hospital."

Evelyn feigned indifference. "It's not like he's dying."

"Would you go if he were?"

"If it were terminal, I'd visit out of basic human decency."

Sophie laughed. "His birthday's coming up - would you attend if invited?"

"No."

"Well, he's not planning a celebration anyway. He never does."

"Then why ask?"

"Just testing your resolve!" Sophie approved of Evelyn's determination.

After hanging up, Evelyn hesitated before finally calling Mrs. Wilkins.

The housekeeper answered immediately. "Evelyn?"

"It's me." A pause. "I heard Dominic's hospitalized. What happened?"

Mrs. Wilkins sighed. "His stomach. He went two days without sleep, then slept for two more without eating. His stomach rebelled."

"So he wasn't refusing food deliberately?"

"No. He tried eating when he woke up, but vomited blood." Mrs. Wilkins shuddered at the memory.

Evelyn felt relief. As long as Dominic wasn't self-harming, it couldn't be too serious.

"Don't worry, he'll recover soon," Evelyn comforted her.

"Have you visited him?" Mrs. Wilkins asked.

"I'm swamped with work," Evelyn deflected.

Mrs. Wilkins recognized the excuse.

"Please don't tell Dominic I called," Evelyn requested. "We're divorced - we should live separate lives."

"Of course," Mrs. Wilkins agreed, then abruptly asked, "Evelyn... is Henry actually Master Dominic's son?"

Evelyn's stomach dropped.

"Perhaps I shouldn't have asked?" Mrs. Wilkins apologized. "I've met Henry twice, and each time I see Master Dominic in him. Their resemblance is uncanny - in looks and temperament. Don't worry, this stays between us."

Evelyn barely remembered ending the call. She wasn't sure whether to be relieved Dominic had never suspected Henry was his. Initially, she'd hidden the children because he'd despised them enough to potentially harm them. Now, she had new reasons for secrecy.

With two women in his life, regardless of circumstances, it wouldn't be appropriate for the children to reconnect with their father. If reconciliation wasn't possible, they were better off not knowing the truth.

During Harvest Festival, the five thousand drones Thornfield Industries had supplied to Blackwood Group performed an aerial ballet above the corporate headquarters, their formations shifting like living constellations under Mike's expert control.
###Chapter 269

"Nathan, aren't our drones impressive?" Lucas asked with a smirk, taking a bite of his apple.

Nathan glanced at his smug expression and suddenly realized Lucas wasn't as insufferable as he'd thought. In fact, he was starting to look almost... charming.

"They're decent. Don't get ahead of yourself. They still need work," Nathan retorted, adjusting his glasses.

"Even the mighty Blackwood Group can't claim perfection, can they?" Lucas shot back. "We're just getting started. The best is yet to come."

"Good luck with that."

"The moon looks stunning tonight," Lucas murmured, gazing up at the sky.

Nathan followed his gaze and hummed in agreement.

"Let's call a truce," Lucas said abruptly, turning to face him with unexpected seriousness. "Who knows? We might need to collaborate someday."

Nathan scoffed. "You just can't get enough of my boss's money, can you?"

"Please. We've dealt with far more ridiculous clients overseas."

"Those drones Dominic bought from you will bring you more than just a billion. This deal will be tomorrow's headline—everyone will want a piece of Alpha Tech after this."

"I know," Lucas said, shrugging. "But it's the least Dominic could do as an ex-husband. Or does he expect Evelyn to grovel in gratitude?"

Nathan rolled his eyes, equal parts amused and exasperated. "That doesn’t mean you should take it for granted."

"Dominic did this willingly."

"...Why isn't your boss here?"

"Same reason yours isn't."

"Hmm."

Were Evelyn and Dominic really avoiding each other?

Time passed swiftly, seasons shifting without pause.

One morning at nine, after dropping Lily off at Willowbrook Academy, Dominic made his way to Henry's classroom.

The teacher excused herself discreetly, leaving them alone.

Henry glanced at Dominic before burying his face in his arms, ignoring him.

"Henry Thorne," Dominic said, leaning against the desk. "Let's make a deal. Today's Lily's birthday, and she wants to celebrate with you. If you agree, I'll grant you one wish."

Henry lifted his head slightly, considering. He had no interest in parties, but the offer was tempting—especially if it meant keeping Dominic away from his mother.

After a pause, Henry pulled out a notebook and pen, scribbling down terms before sliding it toward Dominic.

Dominic arched a brow at the boy's caution but signed without protest.

That evening, Evelyn arrived to pick up Henry—only to freeze in the doorway.

Her son sat in Lily's classroom, surrounded by decorations. A lavish cake, almost too beautiful to eat, sat on the side table.

"Is it... Lily's birthday?" she murmured, pulling out her phone to check the date.

Her breath caught.

If she wasn't mistaken, it was Dominic's birthday too.
###Chapter 270

"What an odd coincidence... Their birthdays fall on the same date?" Evelyn mused to herself.

She tightened her grip on Henry's small hand as they approached the exit.

Suddenly, a familiar imposing silhouette blocked their path.

Dominic stood there wrapped in a charcoal trench coat that accentuated his aloof demeanor. Evelyn couldn't tell if it was her imagination playing tricks or if he'd actually lost weight in recent weeks.

After a brief hesitation, she gathered the courage to offer birthday wishes. But before she could speak, Sophia came bounding forward like an excited puppy.

"Big Brother! I brought your cake!" Sophia chirped, throwing her arms around Dominic's waist.

The words struck Evelyn like a physical blow. "Big Brother?!" Her mind reeled. "Did she just call Dominic that?"

Her sharp gaze locked onto Sophia, who immediately shrank under the intensity.

Sophia fidgeted nervously, her earlier excitement fading. She'd meant to invite Evelyn to join the celebration, but the words died in her throat.

"That's an interesting way to address him," Evelyn remarked, her voice sharper than intended. She hadn't meant to intimidate the girl, but the question tumbled out before she could stop it.

Startled, Sophia ducked behind Dominic like a frightened rabbit. He protectively clasped her hand. "Don't be scared, Sophia. Let's go enjoy that cake."

They brushed past Evelyn without another word, disappearing into the classroom.

Henry tugged at his mother's sleeve, noticing her dazed expression. "Mom? We should leave."

Evelyn blinked rapidly, shaking off her stupor before leading her son away.

Inside the car, Henry observed his mother's troubled expression. "Sophia calls me big brother too," he offered quietly.

Evelyn turned sharply toward him, realization dawning. Of course - Sophia had developmental challenges. The term "big brother" likely just reflected her perception of age hierarchy, nothing more.

"Dominic's records don't mention any sisters," Henry added matter-of-factly.

Evelyn mentally chastised herself. "What am I thinking? There's no possible connection between Dominic and me!"

As she navigated the streets, she changed the subject. "I thought you didn't particularly like Sophia. Why celebrate her birthday?"

Henry remained silent, unwilling to reveal his arrangement with Dominic.

"I know you have a kind heart," Evelyn continued. "She's vulnerable, and I'm not upset you showed her kindness."

Henry stared out the window, unwilling to discuss Sophia further.

"Dominic's birthday is today too," he mentioned casually. He hadn't remembered the date until seeing the two cakes - one labeled "Dominic," the other "Sophia."

"How do you know that?" Evelyn shot him a sideways glance. "Do you pay that much attention to him? Could it be... you want him as your father?"

"I don't need a father," Henry retorted instantly.

Evelyn's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "If circumstances were different... I think you and Lily would benefit from having—"

"I said I don't need one!" Henry's voice carried finality.

Dominic's image was seared into Henry's memory - and not in a way that invited forgiveness.

Meanwhile, Dominic escorted Sophia home, where they encountered Eleanor and her eldest son's family. His expression darkened at the unwelcome sight.

###Chapter 271 

Dominic didn't appreciate unannounced visitors, especially when they were strangers to Sophia. He knew how easily she could get frightened.

Eleanor stood at the forefront, her eyes lighting up the moment she spotted Sophia. She couldn't resist moving closer.

Dominic stepped protectively in front of his sister. "Mother, why didn't you tell me you were coming?"

"It's your birthday... I brought a cake." Eleanor lowered her gaze, murmuring, "I know I should have called first, but I just couldn't wait..."

Her longing to see Sophia had been unbearable.

Sophia peeked at Eleanor from behind Dominic, her doe-like eyes filled with equal parts curiosity and anxiety.

"Sophia, you're not afraid of me, are you?" Eleanor asked hopefully.

Sophia immediately ducked her head again, her fingers tightening around Dominic's shirt.

Dominic reached back and gently squeezed her hand.

"Mother, please go home. We already celebrated at Willowbrook," he said firmly. "Take your cake with you."

Eleanor sighed deeply.

Though disappointed, she felt content seeing her daughter looking well.

The group soon departed, and Dominic led Sophia back inside.

"Madame Eleanor arrived suddenly and insisted I not inform you," Mrs. Wilkins apologized.

Dominic's gaze shifted to Zoe, who stood nearby.

"I've been here since six," Zoe explained quickly. "If you've already had cake, I'll take mine back."

She held a homemade cake in her hands.

Noticing how nervous she appeared, Dominic frowned.

Was he really that intimidating?

"Dr. Montgomery, any progress on Sophia's treatment?" Dominic studied her face intently.

Zoe met his gaze. "The earliest we can proceed is next spring. She needs time to recover after the first surgery. The longer the recovery period, the better."

Dominic nodded. "I expect good results."

"I'll do my best," Zoe promised.

With that, she left with her cake, lost in thought. Eleanor's reaction to Sophia had been unusual. It was Dominic's birthday, yet Eleanor couldn't take her eyes off Sophia.

Her mind racing, Zoe texted Julian.

(Doesn't your grandmother know Sophia? She seemed overly excited.)

Julian replied: (Dr. Montgomery, I can't discuss this. My father would kill me.)

Zoe's curiosity grew. (I'll kill you too if you don't tell me. Which death do you prefer - metaphorical or literal?)

"...What a ruthless woman!" Julian thought.

When he didn't respond immediately, Zoe sent another message. (Let me guess - Sophia is related to the Blackwoods, isn't she? Dominic's ex-wife? Maybe her condition is why the family keeps her secret?)

Julian read her theory with exasperation. (Dr. Montgomery, I don't know the full story either, but it's not like that.)

(Then what is it?)

(She's definitely not my uncle's girlfriend. I'd know if they'd been married.)

Zoe felt relieved. As long as Sophia wasn't Dominic's romantic partner, her exact identity didn't matter.

At 3 AM in Mooncrest Manor's master bedroom, Evelyn's phone rang. Rubbing her eyes, she answered - then bolted upright at the caller's words.

###Chapter 272

Evelyn sat on the edge of her bed, her face alight with unrestrained joy.

Five years ago, her stepmother Margaret and her younger brother Sebastian had stolen three hundred million from Thornfield Industries. After squandering most of the fortune, greed had consumed Sebastian, driving him to plot another scheme against the company. But this time, he wouldn’t walk away with riches—only the cold, unyielding grip of justice.

Just moments ago, Officer Bradford, the detective handling the case, had called Evelyn with electrifying news: Sebastian had boarded a flight back to the country.

A team of officers was already positioned at the airport, ready to ambush him the moment he stepped off the plane. His arrest was imminent.

This was the moment Evelyn had waited years for. Even after hanging up, her pulse refused to steady. She wanted to share the news with her friends, but the clock read three in the morning—too early to wake them.

Restless, she slipped out of bed and padded to the kitchen. The fridge held a few cans of beer her mother used for cooking. She grabbed one and wandered into the living room, collapsing onto the couch.

At four a.m., Dominic was jolted awake by his ringing phone. He scowled at the screen, rubbing his temples.

When Evelyn’s name flashed across the display, he blinked, certain he was hallucinating. He pinched the bridge of his nose and looked again. No mistake—it was her.

He answered immediately, dread coiling in his gut. They hadn’t spoken in months, not unless forced. If she was calling now, something was wrong.

"Hello... Dominic? Happy Birthday!"

Her voice was thick with intoxication. Relief flickered through him—she wasn’t hurt—but then irritation took its place.

"Evelyn Thorne, have you lost your mind?" he snapped, disappointment sharpening his tone.

"...I called to wish you a happy birthday, and this is how you respond?" She crushed the beer can in her hand, imagining it was his neck.

"My birthday was yesterday," he corrected tersely. "Why are you drinking? What happened? Where are you? Give me your address."

He threw off the covers and stalked to the closet, yanking out clothes.

She giggled, the sound bright and unrestrained. "I’m at home! Why do you think I’m this happy?"

Her laughter was like sunlight breaking through storm clouds. He sank onto the edge of the bed, disarmed.

She was genuinely happy—but he had no idea why.

"It’s been so long since I heard you laugh like that, Evelyn," he murmured, his voice rough with something dangerously close to longing.

Her smile faltered. For a heartbeat, it felt like no time had passed at all.

A sharp ache pulsed behind her eyes. She tossed the empty cans into the trash and staggered toward her bedroom.

"Dominic Blackwood... I called you... to wish you a happy birthday..."

"You already did."

"Oh... Then I hope you have a son soon."

He exhaled sharply, too exasperated to be angry. "No, thank you."

"No son? Fine. Then I wish you endless wealth!" She collapsed onto the bed, the room spinning.

Her heavy breathing filled the silence between them. An idea sparked in Dominic’s mind—drunken words were sober thoughts. There was one question he’d never gotten an answer to.

"Evelyn," he began, voice gravelly. "When you were pregnant with our child... did you really get rid of it?"

Henry resembled him. The boy had the same stubborn tilt to his chin that Sophia did.

Dominic couldn’t stop thinking about Henry. If their child had lived, he’d be the same age now.
###Chapter 273

Evelyn heard his deep voice through the phone. The alcohol haze in her mind cleared slightly.

Did he really think she'd reveal secrets just because she'd had a few drinks?

How naive of him.

Sure, she'd consumed more beer than usual, but it wasn't strong liquor. Beer never completely clouded her judgment.

She decided pretending to sleep was her best option now.

Dominic listened to her steady breathing, his thumb hovering over the end call button. He knew she'd never have reached out sober.

The call duration on his screen kept ticking upward.

Evelyn startled awake at 8 AM, her body covered in cold sweat. The nightmare about her father's death had returned with terrifying clarity.

Those dark days after Richard Thorne's passing flashed before her eyes - wandering the streets with her mother Clara, desperate for even a drop of water but too broke to buy any.

She gripped her silk sheets, grounding herself in the present. "It's over," she whispered, "just a bad dream."

Then Dominic's sleep-roughened voice came through her phone: "Morning, Evelyn."

Her eyes flew open. Was she hallucinating? Why was Dominic Blackwood's voice coming from her phone?

"Get a grip," she muttered. "Ghosts don't call people at breakfast time."

She cautiously picked up the device.

Dominic had heard every word. A smirk played on his lips as he awaited her reaction.

When Evelyn saw the call timer showing five hours and seventeen minutes, her stomach dropped.

She nearly threw her phone across the room.

"Did I actually call him? Why?" Her cheeks burned as fragmented memories surfaced. She wanted to ask what she'd said but couldn't find the words.

"Evelyn?" Dominic broke the silence. "You there?"

"...Yeah." She rubbed her throbbing temples. "Listen, about last night...I didn't say anything embarrassing, right?"

His chuckle sent shivers down her spine. "Oh, you absolutely did."

Her headache intensified as she struggled to recall.

"You wished me happy birthday," he said smoothly. "Then predicted I'd have a son within the year."

"What?"

The memories came rushing back - the drinking, the news about Sebastian Whitmore's imminent arrest.

Her eyes darted to the clock. 8:15 AM. By now, Sebastian would be in custody.

"Dominic, I've got to go!" she blurted, ending the call before he could respond.

She immediately dialed Officer Bradford.

He answered on the first ring.

"Officer, did you get him?" Her pulse pounded so loudly she could barely hear herself speak.

"Sebastian Whitmore is currently in interrogation," Bradford confirmed. "Didn't want to wake you with the news."

"Thank you!" The relief was so intense her headache lessened instantly.

"Don't mention it. I'll update you after the questioning."

"Perfect. Thank you!"

At 10 AM, her phone rang again. The international caller ID made her blood run cold. She hadn't spoken to Margaret Thorne in four years, but would recognize that venomous voice anywhere.

"Evelyn Thorne!" Margaret shrieked. "You scheming little bitch! How dare you set up my brother! If anything happens to Sebastian, I'll make you pay!"

###Chapter 274

Evelyn's heart swelled with dark satisfaction as Margaret's enraged screams pierced through the phone.

"And what exactly do you plan to do about it?" Evelyn taunted, her voice dripping with mockery. "You were either complicit in your brother's crimes, or you turned a blind eye. Don't pretend innocence—you spent every stolen dime he took from Thornfield Industries! How dare you even call me?"

"You murdered my daughter Victoria!" Margaret shrieked. "I haven't even made you answer for that!"

"Oh, please," Evelyn scoffed. "Who else in your miserable family has died? Why don't you blame me for that too?" Her tone turned icy. "Did you really think I'd still be the helpless girl you could push around? Margaret, you lost your chance when you failed to kill me five years ago."

The line went dead as Margaret slammed the phone down. But Evelyn knew this wasn't over.

By evening, the headlines blared: Thornfield Industries to Recover Stolen Millions? James Worthington, Former Finance Director, Arrested at Eldermere Airport After Five Years on the Run!

Nathan burst into Evelyn's office, his face alight with excitement. "You didn't tell me about this? Three hundred million—are you serious?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of her tea. "Don't believe everything you read. Do you honestly think he'd return if he hadn't already squandered every last cent?"

Nathan gaped at her. "You lost three hundred million, and you're just sitting here drinking tea?"

"My father lost it," Evelyn corrected coolly. "Not me. People always pay for their mistakes. That was the price he paid for marrying Margaret."

Nathan grinned. "We should celebrate tonight."

"Fine," Evelyn agreed, her lips curving. "You arrange it."

His expression turned sheepish as he toyed with a strand of her hair. "Can I invite Lucas?"

Evelyn's smile faltered. "You two...?"

Were they actually together?

"We've made peace," Nathan admitted, cheeks flushing. "I promise, just Lucas. Not your ex, okay?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Define 'made peace.' Did you two—?"

"Do you want us at each other's throats?" Nathan cut in, exasperated. "Get your mind out of the gutter."

Evelyn smirked. "Fine, invite him." But as Nathan hurried out, she couldn't shake the feeling there was more to the story.

Later, she called Wesley. "Join us tonight?"

"Of course," he agreed. Then, hesitating, he added, "Are you free this afternoon? Could you come to St. Elizabeth Medical Center?"

Evelyn arrived after lunch, and Wesley met her at the entrance, leading her to the private ward.

"Evelyn, I have incredible news," he said, eyes bright. "Eric Montclair is improving. Sebastian Whitmore's star student strikes again."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Is he awake?"

Eric was her first patient since returning to Eldermere.

"Yes," Wesley confirmed. "He regained consciousness. Every specialist in the country had written him off. No one believed he'd wake up—except you."

Evelyn shook her head. "He's not fully recovered yet."

"But he will be," Wesley insisted. "I know you'll get him back on his feet."

She hoped so. Before his accident, Eric had been a reigning idol, his name still ranking among the top celebrities despite his two-year absence. After his surgery, Evelyn had binge-watched every one of his performances.

Now, standing at his bedside, she whispered, "Welcome back, Eric."

His eyelids fluttered open—and for the first time in years, he looked directly at her.

###Chapter 275 

The spotlight loved Eric Montclair.

Whenever he stepped on stage, his mere presence could captivate thousands.

That night, Evelyn Thorne drove Wesley Ashford to the venue Nathan Cross had mentioned.

They exited the car outside the Oceanview Grand Hotel.

"Wesley, everyone here tonight is either my friend or Nathan's, so don't feel restrained," Evelyn said with a bright smile. "We're celebrating Sebastian Whitmore's arrest. It's been weighing on me for ages."

"I know. You've mentioned it before." Wesley studied her face. "You're glowing today."

They entered the grand event hall as directed. The moment they stepped inside, Evelyn's smile vanished.

"What the—? Why are there so many unfamiliar faces? Did we get the wrong hall?" Her gaze landed on Nathan's unmistakable golden hair.

Spotting her, Nathan hurried over. "Evelyn! You made it! And Wesley!"

Evelyn yanked Nathan outside. "Explain."

"Well... When I invited Lucas, he mentioned Blackwood Group was hosting their corporate event here tonight. He suggested we merge gatherings... Save costs, right?" Nathan's eyes gleamed with mischief.

Evelyn's temper flared. "I'm in a celebratory mood, and you think I'd cheap out on food?"

"Relax, Dominic never attends these things," Nathan assured. "Blackwood Group holds biweekly gatherings—he can't possibly show up every time. Lucas swore Dominic only appears for special occasions... and tonight's just routine! I guarantee it!"

Nathan placed a dramatic hand over his heart.

Just then, polished leather shoes clicked against marble. Evelyn turned to see Dominic Blackwood approaching, dressed in his signature black.

She immediately smacked Nathan's arm.

Nathan inhaled sharply. "What now? Our guests are already inside... We can't exactly kick them out."

Dominic stopped before them, his stormy eyes locking onto Evelyn. "Congratulations."

She glared.

"...On securing three hundred million," he added smoothly.

Evelyn arched a brow. "I thought you avoided company mixers."

"I attend when it suits me. No fixed rules," he countered, then smirked. "Drinking tonight?"

"I drink when I please. No fixed rules," she shot back.

Dominic's lips quirked before he strode past them into the hall.

Nathan pulled Evelyn along. "We're staying. Leaving now would look like we're scared of him!" He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "We'll feast on their dime—order the priciest wines!"

Evelyn scoffed. "Have you no shame?"

Nathan flashed his most charming grin. "He's not my ex-husband. The embarrassment's all yours."

Evelyn vowed never to organize another gathering.

Then she noticed Wesley's absence. "Where's Wesley?"

The question hung in the air as her gaze swept the crowded hall.

###Chapter 276

"Dominic dragged him away." Nathan pointed Evelyn in the direction the men had disappeared.

Evelyn turned to see Dominic and Wesley seated alone at a table, their bodyguards standing like sentinels beside them. A bottle of amber liquid glinted under the dim lighting, its presence signaling their intent.

Her lips pressed into a thin line.

Wesley rarely drank, and his tolerance was laughably low.

"Two lightweights! Let's see who taps out first," Nathan teased, mischief dancing in his eyes.

Then it struck her—Dominic couldn't hold his liquor either.

"Evelyn, it's a battle of pride between them. Just let them have their moment," Nathan said, nudging her shoulder playfully.

She shoved his annoyingly perfect face away. "This is entirely your fault!"

"I swear, I'll never fall for Sebastian's tricks again! Next time, I'm dragging him along!" Nathan raised his hands in mock surrender.

"There won't be a next time!" Evelyn stalked toward Sophie.

Sophie flipped Nathan off with a smirk.

It had been weeks since Evelyn last saw Dominic, and now, thanks to Nathan's meddling, here he was. Just the sight of him twisted her stomach into knots, a reminder of the ties she couldn't sever, no matter how hard she tried.

"Evelyn, congrats on reclaiming that fortune." Sophie handed her a glass of sparkling juice. "Whether you actually get it back or not, at least you've honored your father's wishes."

Evelyn nodded. "I'm visiting Dad's grave tomorrow."

"You should take the twins. If he were here..." Sophie's voice softened. "He'd have adored them."

Evelyn considered it, then nodded again.

Her phone buzzed. A glance at the screen sent her stepping aside.

When she returned, her expression was unreadable. "I need to step out. I won't be long."

Margaret had called.

Fresh off her flight back to Eldermere, panic had seized her after her lawyer hinted at Sebastian's impending legal disaster. Desperate, she'd demanded a meeting.

They faced each other in a quiet café near the Oceanview Grand.

Margaret's gaze raked over Evelyn, assessing. The girl looked the same, yet different—her eyes colder, her posture unyielding. The warmth that once lingered in her smile was gone.

"Evelyn, I had nothing to do with my brother's theft," Margaret blurted, breaking the silence. "After all those years with your father, why would I want Thornfield Industries to crumble?"

"Spare me the act. Dad's gone. What's the point?" Evelyn's voice was ice. "I don't have time for this. State your business."

"Let's settle this quietly!" Margaret hissed. "I'll return what he stole! If not for his idiocy, Victoria and I would've had a share of those millions. Now you get it all. Happy?"

As if she were bestowing a favor.

Evelyn's lips curled. "Margaret, is your brother's freedom only worth three hundred million to you? Those overseas ventures of yours must be thriving. But no—we're past private settlements. Unless you can hand me fifty billion."

"Fifty billion?" Margaret's face paled. Might as well slit my throat!

Her fists clenched. "Evelyn Thorne, you're insatiable!"

"Then we're done here." Evelyn rose, smooth and deliberate.

Margaret shot up, desperation flaring. "Wait! Fifty billion isn't pocket change! Give me time!"

###Chapter 277

"Since you're my stepmother, I'll give you one day," Evelyn said icily before striding out of the café.

Back at the gala, both Dominic and Wesley appeared unsteady after only a few drinks.

"Mr. Ashford," Dominic began casually as he refilled Wesley's glass, "I heard Professor Whitmore had a secret protégé."

Wesley's cheeks flushed as he met Dominic's gaze. "Where did you hear that, Mr. Blackwood?"

Dominic lifted his glass, clinking it against Wesley's. "Just answer yes or no."

Wesley took a slow sip, his expression troubled. "I'm afraid I can't discuss Professor Whitmore's private affairs."

"The man is dead. It's not like it's some shameful secret."

"What if that person doesn't want to be found?"

A slow smirk curved Dominic's lips. "So, there is a secret student."

Wesley's slip confirmed it—the elusive protégé was real.

He drained his glass, avoiding Dominic's piercing stare.

"Mr. Ashford," Dominic leaned in, voice dropping, "you are that student, aren't you?"

Wesley choked on his wine, spraying the table. Dominic handed him a napkin without missing a beat.

"Thanks," Wesley muttered, dabbing his mouth. "Mr. Blackwood, I was just Professor Whitmore's assistant. I studied medicine, but I was never worthy of being his student. That's why I worked for him."

Dominic's eyes narrowed. "Really?"

"Of course! Besides, haven't you already found Zoe? She's brilliant."

"She is," Dominic admitted, swirling his drink. "But I want more options. Rumor says the secret student is a middle-aged man. My men have searched for months—nothing."

That was why he'd cornered Wesley tonight.

Wesley groaned. "So I look middle-aged to you?"

"Desperate times," Dominic said dryly.

The alcohol loosened Wesley's tongue. "Your intel's wrong. Even if there was a secret student, it wouldn't be some middle-aged man."

Dominic's gaze sharpened. "A woman, then?"

Wesley pressed his lips together.

"Name your price," Dominic urged. "I'll pay anything."

Overwhelmed, Wesley dropped his head onto the table, feigning drunkenness.

When Evelyn stormed into the hall and saw Wesley slumped over, her blood boiled.

"That bastard Dominic! How dare he get Wesley drunk?"

She marched toward him. Dominic turned, sensing her approach, his usually sharp eyes glazed.

"What the hell is this, Dominic Blackwood?" she snapped.

Flushed, he held up the half-empty bottle innocently. Clearly, Wesley was faking.

"Wesley doesn't drink!" She slammed the bottle down and reached for Wesley.

Dominic yanked her back.

Evelyn stumbled, crashing into his chest.

"Evelyn, I—" His voice roughened as he stared at her, his breath warm against her skin. "I think I'm drunk."

###Chapter 278

His breath was warm against her skin, heavy with the scent of whiskey.

Evelyn was certain he was drunk—otherwise, Dominic Blackwood would never have pulled her into his arms in front of his entire staff.

"You should know your limits," she muttered, trying to push away, but his grip only tightened around her waist.

"Evelyn," he murmured, reaching for the bottle and pouring amber liquid into two glasses. "Were you drowning your sorrows last night because of Sebastian's arrest?"

His hold loosened just enough for her to slip free. She scanned the room, but Wesley was gone.

"Dominic!" Her voice was sharp. "Where's Wesley?"

His cheeks were flushed, his gaze too knowing. She didn’t trust that look. His men must have taken Wesley away while he had her trapped.

"Given his state, I had him escorted to a room to sleep it off," Dominic drawled, offering her a glass. "Relax. I wouldn’t harm Mr. Ashford."

Her phone buzzed. A message from Wesley:

[Evelyn, I’m sober. He kept pressing about Professor Whitmore’s secret student. Played drunk to escape. He might suspect you. Be careful.]

Relief was short-lived. Her pulse spiked as she met Dominic’s watchful stare. She took the glass and downed it in one go.

"What were you doing outside earlier?" he asked, sipping his drink.

Her breath hitched. He’d been watching her. The realization sent a jolt through her.

"Dominic," she said, sitting beside him, "have you forgotten your own words? ‘I’ll be damned if I seek you out again.’"

His lips curved. "I came for the party, not for you."

"Then why care what I was doing?" she shot back. "Careful, or you’ll damn yourself after all."

His eyes gleamed under the dim light. "Evelyn, you don’t actually think I’m drunk, do you?" He leaned closer. "If life’s already hell, what’s damnation?"

She stood abruptly, turning to his guards. "Your boss is wasted. Take him home."

Without another word, she walked away.

The moment she was gone, Dominic set his glass down and left.

"Evelyn!" Sophie yanked her into the restroom. "What was that? Your face is burning!"

Evelyn pressed her hands to her cheeks. "Just the alcohol."

"Was Dominic drunk? The way he held you—like a starving predator with its prey!" Sophie gasped. "I’ve never seen him like that. It was terrifying!"

Evelyn groaned. "Do you think he’s not human?"

"Honestly? No. He’s always been this untouchable ice statue. Sometimes I wonder if he’s a machine."

"If he were, I’d have pulled the plug by now."

Sophie laughed.

Back at the table, Sophie nudged her. "Who called you out earlier? You vanished so fast."

"Guess."

Sophie frowned. "Everyone you know is here. Who else—?"

"My stepmother," Evelyn said, savoring a bite of steak. "Turns out, I might walk away with more than three hundred million."

Sophie’s jaw dropped.

Evelyn smirked and took another sip of wine.
###Chapter 279

The fact that Margaret was willing to negotiate at fifty billion meant she had the funds.

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Dominic Blackwood’s office at Blackwood Group, casting golden streaks across the polished mahogany desk.

Dominic scanned the list of students who had studied under Professor Sebastian Whitmore. According to Wesley Ashford’s revelation the previous night, the professor’s secret protégé wasn’t middle-aged, nor was it a man—which significantly narrowed down his search.

Then, his gaze landed on Evelyn Thorne’s name.

Evelyn had been one of Sebastian’s students, but because she had pursued medicine, Dominic had initially dismissed her file without much thought.

Her academic record appeared straightforward—nothing beyond coursework and published research papers. He pulled up one of her publications online, but the dense medical jargon might as well have been hieroglyphics. He closed the tab.

Perhaps Evelyn wasn’t as unremarkable as he’d assumed. Sebastian wouldn’t have taken her under his wing if she were ordinary. Wesley had admitted that even he hadn’t been deemed worthy enough to be a direct student—only an assistant.

If Evelyn had such talent, why had she abandoned medicine after graduation? Was it truly just for money? And if so, why waste two years studying under one of the most demanding professors in the field?

Dominic’s brow furrowed. He picked up a pen and wrote Evelyn Thorne on a notepad, then branched out to Sebastian Whitmore and Apex Innovations. Finally, he jotted down Mike beside the company name.

Apex Innovations’ sudden profitability had coincided with Mike’s arrival. Mike had once boasted to Nathan Cross about his hacking prowess, and indeed, there was no trace of him anywhere online.

Why would a hacker of his caliber willingly work for Evelyn?

Dominic drew a question mark beside Mike’s name.

Meanwhile, in the cemetery, Evelyn stood before her father’s grave with her mother and children.

"Dad," she murmured, placing a bouquet of lilies on the polished granite. "Mom and I are here. And your grandchildren came to see you too."

Richard Thorne’s photograph smiled back at her from the headstone.

"I’ve rebuilt Thornfield Industries," she continued softly. "And James Worthington is behind bars now. You can rest in peace."

A cool breeze swept through, rustling the leaves. Just then, her phone buzzed in her purse. She pulled it out and saw Margaret’s name flashing on the screen. Without hesitation, she answered.

"Evelyn," Margaret’s voice was hoarse, as if she hadn’t slept all night. "I’ve considered your terms. I can’t pay fifty billion upfront, but I can sign a contract guaranteeing full payment within a year."

She hadn’t wanted to spend a single cent saving her brother, but her parents had threatened to disown her if she refused.

Evelyn’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Oh?" Her tone was glacial. "Then we have nothing to discuss."

Margaret’s breath hitched. "What do you mean?! You said if I paid fifty billion, you’d settle this privately!"

"Did I?" Evelyn’s fingers brushed the edge of her father’s gravestone. "I said I’d consider it. And after careful consideration, I’ve decided James should face the full weight of the law."

Her voice dropped to a whisper.

"Let him rot."

###Chapter 280

She had never intended to settle things quietly. The words were merely a cruel tease—a fleeting promise dangled before Margaret only to be snatched away. Evelyn wanted her to choke on despair.

"Fine! Evelyn, just fine!" Margaret's lips trembled with fury. "I never planned to pay fifty billion in the first place! My fortune wasn't earned without sacrifice!"

"Then I hope your brother's ghost doesn't haunt you when he's gone," Evelyn taunted, her voice dripping with venom. "I wonder how you divided that twenty billion you stole from us."

Margaret's blood boiled.

"Evelyn Thorne... Just you wait... I won't let you walk away unscathed... My brother, my daughter... I will make you pay!"

"Oh? Planning to hire an assassin?" Evelyn's laugh was cold. "Eldermere's surveillance and law enforcement have advanced far beyond what they were five years ago. Think carefully—can you bear the consequences? Murder and hiring a killer both carry the death penalty here."

Margaret's face drained of color. The call ended abruptly.

Clara studied Evelyn. "Is she still as arrogant as ever?"

"She built a cosmetics empire overseas. Profitable."

Clara lowered her gaze, silent.

"Mom, she funded that company with stolen money." Evelyn's voice hardened. "No amount of success will erase what she did—getting Dad killed and bankrupting Thornfield Industries. She will pay."

Clara nodded. "Karma took her daughter young. All I care about is your safety, Evelyn. The money means nothing."

That evening, Nathan called Lucas, inviting him for drinks.

Lucas was home, and Evelyn's sharp gaze locked onto him the moment he answered.

He'd sworn off alcohol after last night's excess, opting for a quiet dinner—but Nathan's invitation was hard to refuse.

"Didn't you drink last night? Again?" Lucas shot Evelyn a guilty glance.

"What, can't handle it?" Nathan challenged.

Since reconciling with Lucas, Dominic had tasked Nathan with extracting information. Why had Lucas partnered with Evelyn? Was there more to the story?

Lucas, prideful and young, would never admit defeat.

"Send the address. I'm on my way." He hung up and turned to Evelyn.

She arched a brow. "Nathan?"

Lucas flushed, scratching his head. "How'd you guess?"

"Who else could drag you out? Remember your hangover this morning? You swore off alcohol this week."

"I said no wine. Beer is basically water." He grinned, stepping onto the porch.

Evelyn followed. "Have you considered why Nathan's asking?"

"Huh?" Lucas paused mid-shoe change.

She recounted Dominic's interrogation of Wesley last night and warned, "If Nathan probes, you know what to say. If you slip, our friendship ends here."

Lucas clenched his fists. "That snake! Always scheming! I'll drink him under the table tonight—teach him a lesson!"

"Don't. He has work tomorrow."

"Not my problem. Relax, I won't betray you."

Evelyn hesitated. "If you were dating Nathan... would you tell him?"

"Even if he were my husband, I'd never reveal what you don't want shared. You saved my life. You come first."

Relieved, Evelyn let him go.

###Chapter 281

The next morning, Nathan Cross dragged himself into the office, his head pounding from last night's drinking session.

Dominic Blackwood took one look at him and raised an eyebrow. "What happened to you?"

"Lucas Grant tricked me into drinking," Nathan groaned, rubbing his temples. "I barely got any answers out of him before I blacked out. But I did notice something—he has a scar on his head."

Dominic's gaze sharpened. "How noticeable is it?"

"Very. It looks like he's had a craniotomy." Nathan had been half-conscious when Lucas carried him back to the hotel, but even in his drunken haze, he’d spotted the jagged line hidden beneath Lucas’s golden hair.

When he woke up that morning, he found himself sharing a bed with Lucas again. Surprisingly, he hadn’t lashed out this time. Instead, while Lucas was still asleep, he carefully parted his hair and snapped a photo of the scar. The surgical marks were unmistakable.

"Look." Nathan showed Dominic the picture. "This isn’t just any scar. It’s from major surgery."

Dominic studied the image, his expression unreadable. "A craniotomy is serious. Next time, don’t drink—just ask him directly. Now go home and rest."

Nathan nodded, though his head still throbbed. "Mr. Blackwood… are you investigating Lucas because you suspect Evelyn?"

Dominic’s eyes flickered. "Don’t you think she’s acting strange?"

"Of course!" Nathan frowned. "She clearly loves you, so why the divorce? I get that she’s jealous of Sophia, but can’t she be more understanding? I’m disappointed in her."

Dominic sighed. They weren’t even talking about the same thing.

"Go home. And next time you’re hungover, don’t come in." Dominic turned his leather chair away, signaling the end of the conversation.

The truth was, Evelyn hadn’t known about Sophia’s condition when she filed for divorce. He couldn’t blame her. If anyone was at fault, it was him.

Later that afternoon, Dominic received a call from Zoe Montgomery.

"Dominic, my father’s back in town. Are you free tonight? He wants to have dinner with you."

Dominic checked his watch. "Fine."

"Oh, and… I mentioned my parents are divorced, right? My dad’s bringing his new girlfriend. I hope that’s okay?" Zoe sounded hesitant.

Dominic replied flatly, "It’s fine."

He had no interest in Zoe—or her father’s love life.

An hour later, Dominic sat across from Zoe’s father and his new companion. The moment he saw her, his mind went blank. His sharp gaze locked onto the woman beside Richard Montgomery.

"Mr. Blackwood, do I look familiar?" Margaret Thorne smiled sweetly. "We were connected once, though we never actually met. Funny how fate works, isn’t it?"

Dominic’s expression darkened instantly. The air grew thick with tension.

Then, his phone rang. Without a word, he answered and strode out of the restaurant.
###Chapter 282

The phone vibrated in Dominic's hand. Nathan's name flashed on the screen.

"Lucas mentioned there was a malignant brain tumor before," Nathan's voice came through clearly. "During severe episodes, he'd lose consciousness completely. Professor Sebastian performed the surgery to remove it."

Dominic's fingers tightened around the device. "Did he explain why he partnered with Evelyn?"

"He did. Said he's passionate about drone technology. Evelyn had Richard Thorne's proprietary system. After enhancing it, he was so impressed that he co-founded Apex Innovations with her."

The explanation felt hollow.

Ending the call, Dominic turned back toward the restaurant entrance. Though every fiber of his being recoiled at Margaret's presence, he needed Zoe's expertise. For Sophia's sake, he'd tolerate this charade.

Zoe rushed to meet him at the door. "Dominic, I swear I had no idea. First time meeting Margaret. My father never mentioned she was Evelyn's stepmother - we barely speak."

Dominic gave a curt nod before striding to the table. "Richard," he acknowledged Zoe's father with measured politeness. Margaret might as well have been invisible.

"Dominic." Richard's smile faltered. "My apologies. Living abroad, Margaret and I never discussed... past connections."

"Unnecessary. Evelyn and I are divorced." Dominic's tone could freeze molten lava.

Margaret cleared her throat. "Dominic, I've apologized to Evelyn already. Offered seven hundred million as restitution. She refused."

Zoe gasped. "Seven hundred million?!"

The sum was staggering. Who knew this woman commanded such wealth?

"Not liquid assets," Margaret clarified. "But with company collateral... I wanted to demonstrate sincerity. Reconciliation proves... challenging."

The afternoon call had come unexpectedly.

"Dominic? Father's returned from Geneva. Wants dinner tonight - are you free?"

Dominic checked his watch. "Schedule it."

"There's... something else. My parents divorced years ago. He's bringing his new partner. Hope that's acceptable?"

"Not an issue." He'd no interest in Zoe's personal life, let alone her father's romantic entanglements.

The restaurant meeting hit like a sucker punch. Dominic froze upon recognizing Margaret Thorne beside Richard Montgomery.

"Mr. Blackwood." Margaret's smile didn't reach her eyes. "We've been connected before, yet never properly met. What an... interesting coincidence."

Dominic's expression turned glacial. The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees.

His phone's ringtone provided escape. Stepping outside, Nathan's update about Lucas's medical history offered temporary reprieve.

Back inside, Zoe's anxious whispers and Richard's awkward attempts at conversation filled the tense silence. Margaret's seven hundred million offer hung in the air like toxic fumes.

"Perhaps we should change topics," Zoe suggested nervously, noting Dominic's thunderous expression.

Returning home, Dominic's resolve hardened. Following Zoe's treatment plan now seemed untenable. If Evelyn discovered Margaret's involvement - as Richard's lover, potentially Zoe's future stepmother - she'd sever all contact completely.

Sophia's sudden embrace caught him off guard. Her warmth, her childlike dependence squeezed his heart. Though showing remarkable progress, she still needed constant care.

New Year approached. With it, Sophia's next treatment phase. The anticipation should have brought hope. Instead, Margaret's reappearance left him nauseated. Continuing this farce with Zoe meant endless encounters with that woman.

"Sophia," Dominic guided her to the sofa, "do you like Dr. Montgomery?"

She studied him with those clear, guileless eyes. A pause. Then, cleverly: "Do you?"

Dominic shook his head. "Her expertise could heal you. That's all that matters."

Sophia brightened. "Evelyn can heal me too!"

Dominic stilled. "Has Evelyn... treated you before?"

A hesitant nod.

His hands framed her shoulders. "When? During your disappearance?"

With caregivers monitoring Sophia's every move, only those unaccounted hours provided opportunity. The realization struck like lightning - Evelyn had intervened when he'd failed to protect his sister. Again.
###Chapter 283

Evelyn could see the truth was impossible to conceal any longer. Yet Sophia's terrified expression as she cowered before her brother's stern gaze made Evelyn's heart clench.

The little girl hung her head in silence, trembling fingers clutching the hem of her dress.

Over at Mooncrest Manor, Lucas was holding court in the grand parlor, bragging about his legendary drinking prowess. "I had Nathan completely wasted in under an hour!" he declared, puffing out his chest. "The man couldn't even stand straight!"

He smirked, swirling his whiskey glass. "And the best part? He bought every word of my story. Dominic will never suspect a thing."

Evelyn methodically peeled an apple, her knife flashing in the firelight. She handed him the sliced fruit without looking up. "For once, you actually used your brain."

"Excuse me?" Lucas sputtered indignantly, snatching the plate. "I'll have you know my intellect rivals Sherlock Holmes himself!" He took an aggressive bite, juice dripping down his chin. "I simply choose when to apply it."

Just then, Lily burst into the room clutching a leather-bound photo album. "Mommy! Who is this gorgeous man?" she squealed, pointing excitedly. "I'm in love!"

Evelyn's knife clattered to the table. The album contained her private collection of Eric Montclair memorabilia - her longtime celebrity crush.

"Lily Thorne," she said through gritted teeth, snapping the book shut. "How many times must I tell you not to go through my things?"

The child pouted dramatically. "Then you should lock them up properly! Besides," she added with a mischievous grin, "if you like him so much, why can't I?"

Henry glanced up from his book with a derisive snort. "Pathetic fangirl behavior."

Lily stuck out her tongue. "Mommy's a fangirl too! So if I'm pathetic, that makes Mommy pathetic!"

Defeated by his sister's flawless logic, Henry retreated to his room with an eye roll.

Snuggling into Evelyn's lap, Lily batted her lashes. "When you remarry, Mommy, promise you'll find someone this handsome. Grandma and I would approve wholeheartedly."

Clara muffled a laugh behind her hand while Evelyn massaged her temples. Before she could reprimand her daughter, the doorbell chimed.

At nine o'clock? Evelyn frowned. Only Sophie ever visited unannounced, and never this late.

Lucas peered through the peephole and recoiled. "Holy hell, Evelyn! It's your ex!" he hissed, scrambling back. "And he brought company."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. Who would Dominic bring here at this hour?

Handing Lily to Clara, who immediately whisked the children away, Evelyn approached the door. Before she could speak, Dominic's icy voice cut through the foyer.

"Is she here?" he demanded.

Sophia shuffled inside, shrinking under Evelyn's questioning glare. The girl pressed her lips together, eyes darting nervously.

Dominic gripped his sister's wrist and stormed past Evelyn into the living room. "Elliot—" Evelyn began, but he whirled on her.

"Silence!" Dominic's voice cracked like a whip. His piercing gaze locked onto hers. "When Sophia disappeared... was she here with you?"

Evelyn's throat tightened. He knew.

The confirmation flashed across Dominic's face as he took in her reaction. A glacial fury settled over his features.

"How did she get here?" Each word dripped with venom as he advanced. "Why wasn't I informed?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Did you enjoy watching me tear the city apart searching for her?"

###Chapter 284

Back then, Dominic had spent one hundred and fifty-five million dors searching for Sophia.

The entire country knew of his desperate hunt for her. He had never believed Evelyn had any involvement in her disappearance.

Evelyn's cheeks burned under Dominic's accusatory glare. The sharp edge in his voice left no doubt—he thought she had kidnapped Sophia and brought her here.

At that moment, Evelyn hadn't even had time to think. She was running a high fever! If she had returned Sophia to him while the girl was still sick, he would have accused her of neglect.

"Yes!" Evelyn snapped, her voice trembling with frustration. "I was thrilled to watch you lose your mind!"

Suddenly, the room plunged into darkness. The lights flickered out.

"Ah!" Sophia shrieked, immediately latching onto the nearest person.

Lucas stiffened. "Why are you clinging to me? Let go!"

"I'm scared! Terrified!" Sophia whimpered, refusing to release him. Lucas sighed in resignation. It was just a hug.

He wasn't losing anything by it. Why argue with someone who wasn't fully capable of understanding? Besides, Dominic would take her away soon.

Just as Lucas assumed Dominic would reclaim Sophia, the man's voice cut through the dark. "It was your son who took Sophia from school, wasn't it? You ordered him to do it!"

Lucas frowned in confusion. What was wrong with Dominic? Sophia was trembling in fear, yet he ignored her, fixated on his argument with Evelyn.

"Yes! I told my son to do it!" Evelyn's voice rose above his, raw with emotion. "I deliberately sent him to bring Sophia here. I wanted to see the kind of woman you desired—to see how extraordinary she was! And what do I find? A simpleton!"

Dominic could hurl all the insults he wanted at her, but dragging Henry into this was crossing a line.

His relentless accusations shattered Evelyn's composure.

If he wanted her to be the villain, she would show him exactly how cruel she could be.

The moment the words left her lips, silence swallowed the room. Then, just as abruptly, the lights flared back to life.

Evelyn saw the storm in Dominic's eyes—dark, furious, his fists clenched so tightly his knuckles whitened. He looked seconds away from striking her.

Her pulse raced. Reality crashed back. How could she have called Sophia that? Even in anger, she should never have said it in front of her.

Evelyn's gaze darted around, searching for Sophia.

Clara and the children stood frozen in the doorway of the playroom, staring at Sophia. The girl stared at the floor. They had all heard. And despite their dislike for her, pity was all they felt now.

"Sophia," Clara said softly, her small voice cutting through the tension, "my mommy didn't mean what she said. She was lying. So she's lying about you being... that too."

Sophia's eyes brightened at Clara's words. Before, Clara had always ignored her. Now, she was the one reaching out. A tiny spark of happiness flickered in Sophia's chest.

"But I am," Sophia admitted with a blink, her voice earnest. "Evelyn wasn't lying."

The room fell silent again.

In the living room, Dominic's entire body tensed. His eyes glistened, red-rimmed with pain as he turned to Evelyn, his voice breaking. "Evelyn, you can hurt me all you want. But don't you dare say that about Sophia."

Every word dripped with betrayal and anguish.

Evelyn opened her mouth to apologize—then swallowed the words. "Take Sophia and leave," she said coldly, before turning on her heel and striding to her bedroom.
###Chapter 285

Evelyn slammed the door shut and turned the lock with trembling fingers.

Dominic watched the confrontation end. Without hesitation, he guided Sophia out of the playroom.

"Wait! Mr. Blackwood!" Lucas had intended to defend Evelyn.

Dominic shot him a warning glare. "Not another word!"

Lucas pressed his lips together. He watched helplessly as Dominic led Sophia away.

A light rain had begun falling as they stepped outside Mooncrest Manor. Dominic removed his coat and gently covered Sophia's head with it.

Inside the car, Sophia clutched his jacket like a security blanket. Her tear-filled eyes remained fixed on the mansion.

Dominic fastened her seatbelt with unsteady hands. His voice came out rough. "Don't look back, Sophia."

"Dominic... I'm so sorry..." Tears streaked down her pale cheeks.

"None of this is your fault." He brushed away her tears with trembling fingers. "You have nothing to apologize for."

Her small frame shook with quiet sobs. "It was me. I was terrified of the operation, so I begged Henry to take me away..."

The confession tumbled out - the truth she'd been too frightened to share until this moment.

Dominic's mind flashed to Evelyn's icy stare. Why hadn't she explained? Did she enjoy provoking him?

"Dominic, please don't blame Evelyn. She's been so kind to me." Sophia's breath hitched as she remembered. "When I fell ill... she gave me medicine. She's wonderful, really..."

Dominic wiped her tears with a tissue, his throat tight. "So Henry brought you home, you became sick, and Evelyn treated you? Did she call the ambulance too?"

Sophia blinked through her tears. "I don't remember everything. Just that Evelyn was so gentle... not like tonight. She's good, Dominic."

His jaw clenched. "She called you names. Doesn't that anger you?"

A fresh wave of pain crashed through him. Sophia hadn't always been this way. Their father's abuse had stolen so much from her.

No one would ever hurt her again.

Sophia shook her head, her eyes red-rimmed. "You hired Dr. Montgomery to help me... because I'm slow, right?"

Dominic pulled her into a fierce embrace. "No! Never think that." His voice broke. "I want you to experience everything beautiful this world has to offer—"

"But it's true." She pressed her face against his shoulder. "Evelyn wasn't wrong. I'm not angry... so please don't be angry either?"

Her soft plea shattered his resolve. Gripping the steering wheel, he turned toward the rain-streaked window. Silent tears tracked down his face.

"There's nothing wrong with how I am." Sophia inhaled the familiar scent of his jacket. "As long as I have you, I don't mind staying this way forever."

Dominic's lips parted, but no words came. He would find a cure. She wouldn't remain trapped like this - he'd make certain of it.

Back in Mooncrest Manor, Evelyn lay curled on her bed, agony twisting through her. The line between living and dying felt paper-thin.

She shouldn't have lost control. She could have explained properly... but how could she when Dominic had stormed in looking for a fight?

From the moment he'd crossed her threshold, his eyes had burned with accusation. He hadn't come for answers - he'd come to punish her.

This was her home! Why should she endure such treatment here?

Evelyn dragged a pillow over her face, suffocating in regret. Calling Sophia names was inexcusable. How was that any better than Dominic's immediate assumption she'd kidnapped the girl?

She'd lashed out at an innocent because Dominic hurt her. And now it was too late. Outside her window, an engine roared to life, carrying her mistakes away into the night.
###Chapter 286

Evelyn emerged from her bedroom to find all eyes in the living room fixed on her. An uncomfortable silence hung thick in the air.

"Did I go too far earlier?" Evelyn sank into the sofa cushions, her fingers twisting nervously. "I shouldn't have said those things about Sophia."

"Absolutely not!" Clara exclaimed, jumping to her feet. "That bastard Dominic started shouting first! The moment you opened your mouth, he told you to shut up. Honestly, you showed remarkable restraint! If it were me, I would've torn him to shreds! Not only would I call Sophia an idiot, I'd say the entire Blackwood family belongs in a circus!"

Evelyn blinked at Clara's unexpected outburst.

Lily nodded vigorously in agreement. "Mom, you were upset. Anyone with half a brain would understand you didn't mean it."

Evelyn's shoulders slumped. "I don't care what Dominic thinks of me. I'm worried about hurting Sophia's feelings."

Her chest tightened at the thought. The spiteful words had tumbled out in anger, but now she regretted potentially wounding the innocent woman.

"Sophia isn't mad. She said she knows she's not smart anyway," Clara offered gently.

"That's exactly why I feel terrible." Restless energy buzzed beneath Evelyn's skin. She abruptly stood and retreated back to her room, unable to bear the weight of her guilt.

Watching their mother's distress, Lily and Henry exchanged troubled glances. Tonight had revealed the stark differences between Sophia and themselves in painful clarity.

Though Sophia appeared grown, her mind remained childlike. Even young children would cry if called names, yet Sophia accepted the cruel label without protest. Henry suddenly felt ashamed of his previous hostility.

Back in their shared room, Lily pulled out her art supplies and began sketching with intense focus.

Henry peered over her shoulder. "What are you drawing?"

"Can you give this to Sophia tomorrow?" Lily held up a vibrant watercolor of blooming roses against crisp white paper.

Henry hesitated but didn't refuse. His voice softened. "I feel bad for Sophia too." Lily's eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "Nobody chooses to be different. Only someone truly cruel wouldn't care about being called names."

Henry carefully tucked the painting into his backpack.

"Let's be nicer to Sophia from now on, okay?" Lily grasped Henry's hand with sudden seriousness. "We can hate our stupid father all we want, but Sophia didn't do anything wrong."

The next day during recess, Sophia appeared at Henry's classroom door as usual. This time, Henry turned to face her directly.

Sophia's face lit up like sunrise when presented with the artwork. The previous night's incident might as well have never occurred.

"I love it!" Sophia enveloped Henry in a crushing hug before he could react. Henry stiffened - while he'd resolved to be kinder, her overwhelming displays of affection still made him uncomfortable.

Extricating himself with difficulty, Henry hastily retreated into the classroom and shut the door firmly behind him.

Moments later, Sophia's caretaker arrived bearing an overflowing basket of exotic fruits and gourmet treats. She handed it to Henry's teacher with a warm smile.

"Sophia insisted on sending these for Henry," the caretaker explained. Her gaze drifted to Henry just as he glanced up from his desk.

For one startling moment, the woman saw not Henry, but Dominic's striking features reflected in the boy's face.

Returning to Sophia's classroom, the caretaker found her charge still admiring Lily's painting with childlike wonder.

"Sophia," the caretaker began carefully, sitting beside her. "Don't you think Henry resembles your brother?"

Sophia nodded enthusiastically. "I like Henry very much."

"What I mean is... Henry might actually be your brother's son." The caretaker lowered her voice, ensuring their privacy. "If Henry is Dominic's child, that would make you his aunt."

"Aunt?" Sophia's brow furrowed in concentration, the new concept slowly taking root in her mind.

###Chapter 287

"Yes! Sophia, you're an aunt now!" The nanny laughed, then her expression turned thoughtful. "But I don't believe your brother is aware of this. I can't confirm if Henry is truly his son as well."

Sophia's face fell. "He doesn't like Dominic."

The nanny shook her head. "That's because your brother is currently in a relationship. I really shouldn't be discussing this—their situation is far too complicated."

Sophia, as always, tuned out the complicated matters and returned her attention to the painting Henry had gifted her, her fingers tracing the delicate brushstrokes with admiration.

That weekend, Sophie and Evelyn set out for a shopping spree. "If everything goes smoothly, I'll be spending New Year's at Adrian's place," Sophie confessed, a hint of nervousness in her voice. "I overheard my father and his discussing... marriage arrangements."

Evelyn smiled warmly. "Isn't that wonderful? You two have been together for ages. It's about time."

"But we're still so young! There's so much more we haven't experienced yet!" Sophie tugged Evelyn into a high-end boutique, her excitement tinged with anxiety.

Evelyn chuckled. "How is what you have now any different from being married? You're practically inseparable."

"Yes, we do plan to spend our lives together, but what if our feelings change? What if we grow tired of each other?" Sophie paused at the new arrivals section, picking up a sleek casual jacket. "Evelyn, what do you think of this one?"

"Too outdated," Evelyn replied without hesitation.

Sophie shot her a playful glare. "Since when did you develop such questionable taste?"

"Evelyn, what's gotten into you today? Since when would I buy something like this for Adrian?" Sophie teased, then gasped dramatically. "Wait—are you in love?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Spare me. I'd like to live a little longer."

Sophie laughed. "You're right. Being single is far less complicated." She checked the jacket's tag before flagging down a sales associate. "Do you have this in a triple XL?"

"Only double XL for this style, but we have a similar design available in triple XL," the associate offered, presenting an alternative.

With no father or uncles to shop for, Evelyn found herself with little to buy. She settled onto a plush sofa nearby, idly flipping through a glossy fashion magazine.

Suddenly, a pair of sleek black boots entered her line of sight. She glanced up—and froze. Zoe Montgomery stood before her, her presence as unexpected as it was unwelcome.

"Evelyn, what a surprise!" Zoe chirped, her smile saccharine. She had been accompanying her father on his shopping trip and had overheard Sophie mention Evelyn's name moments earlier.

"Indeed, what a coincidence," Evelyn replied coolly, not bothering to rise from her seat.

Richard Montgomery approached, eyeing Evelyn curiously. "Is this a friend of yours?" he asked his daughter.

Zoe's lips curled. "This is Dominic Blackwood's ex-wife, Evelyn Thorne."

"Ah..." Recognition flickered in Richard's eyes. He'd heard of Evelyn, but this was his first time seeing her in person. She was far more striking than her photographs suggested.

"I'm finished here," Richard announced, deliberately ignoring Evelyn. Margaret despised the woman, ranting about her incessantly at home.

"If you like them, take them all!" Zoe declared, pulling a sleek black card from her purse. "After all, Dominic is footing the bill."

Her words were laced with implication—that Dominic had given her the card. The associate accepted it eagerly, preparing the receipt for signature.

"Should I sign my name or my boyfriend's?" Zoe asked loudly, ensuring Evelyn heard every word.

"Yours will do," the associate gushed, envy dripping from her voice. "Your boyfriend must adore you—this card has no spending limit!"

Zoe beamed. "Absolutely. He treats me like a queen. And I love him more than anything."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the magazine, but her expression remained impassive. The game, it seemed, was far from over.

###Chapter 288

Evelyn kept flipping through the fashion magazine with deliberate disinterest. The glossy pages turned mechanically under her fingers, her expression carefully blank.

The magazine was abruptly snatched from her hands.

"Don't you feel awkward staying here?" Sophie yanked her up from the plush sofa with surprising strength. "What terrible luck! Running into such unpleasant company while shopping."

Sophie's voice carried clearly across the boutique, ensuring Zoe couldn't possibly miss the barb.

Evelyn sighed. "It's a public store. Anyone can come in."

"Exactly why I said we're unlucky!" Sophie declared dramatically. "I refuse to shop here another minute. Let's go." She gripped Evelyn's wrist tightly, attempting to drag her toward the exit.

Evelyn planted her heels. "Since when did you become such a coward?"

The question froze Sophie mid-motion. Her eyes widened with realization. Right. Why was she running? She wasn't afraid of Zoe Montgomery.

With renewed determination, Sophie grabbed an armful of random garments and marched to the register, pulling Evelyn along.

"Is swiping someone else's credit card really such an accomplishment?" Sophie's mocking laughter rang through the store. "Some people act like being financially dependent is something to brag about. Real power comes from spending your own money!"

Though Zoe's name wasn't mentioned, the target was unmistakable. Zoe spun around, her smile brittle.

"Oh my! If it isn't Miss Montgomery!" Sophie feigned surprise with theatrical flair. "Shopping alone today? How unusual. I heard you and Dominic were practically inseparable these days. Was that all just for show? If not, why isn't he here holding your hand while you spend his money? Credit cards are so... impersonal."

Zoe's face darkened to match the shade of her black Amex. She knew Sophie Mercer was the sole heiress to the Mercer retail empire. And Evelyn Thorne controlled Thornfield Industries. Both women had fortunes that dwarfed her own - even with Dominic's generous spending allowance.

The sales associate began folding Sophie's haphazard selections. "Miss Mercer, these are all triple XL. They won't fit—"

"Wrap them anyway," Sophie interrupted with a careless wave. "They'll make excellent dust rags."

Zoe's complexion turned ashen. Richard Montgomery, recognizing the danger, quickly steered his daughter away.

Once outside, Zoe shook off her father's grip. "Why did you drag me out? I wasn't afraid of them!"

"Because nothing good comes from public scenes," Richard hissed. "Do you think Dominic would approve? Men don't appreciate catty behavior."

Inside the boutique, Evelyn was quietly returning the oversized garments to their proper places. "That was unnecessarily harsh."

Sophie snorted. "With vipers like her, you have to strike first. Did you hear how loud she was bragging about that card? Practically screaming it for your benefit. Maybe you can tolerate that nonsense, but I won't."

Over lunch at a nearby bistro, Sophie dropped another bombshell. "Dominic's been showering Zoe with attention lately. Her father's been back in the country looking for investment opportunities. Dominic's been making introductions using his connections."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her water glass. "I don't care about their relationship."

"Really? Then why won't you look at me?" Sophie challenged. "Even if you don't love him anymore, it still stings, doesn't it?"

"Not wanting to hear about him doesn't mean I still have feelings," Evelyn countered coolly. "Tell me, would you enjoy it if I brought up your ex right now?"
###Chapter 289

"I'll still be happy! My ex and I remain close friends!"

Evelyn was at a loss for words.

"Evelyn, you never know. They might actually tie the knot," Sophie continued excitedly. "Eleanor adores Zoe. And Dominic... well, he's finally come to his senses. Adrian and I were just saying that if Sophia's second surgery succeeds before New Year's, he'll surely propose to Zoe."

Evelyn maintained her composure. "I wish them every happiness."

"You need to think about your future too!" Sophie's voice softened with concern. "You're still young. Clara can help with the twins, and they're already in school. You've got your whole life ahead of you."

"I'm perfectly content," Evelyn smiled. "Stop looking at me like I'm some tragic figure. Being single isn't a crime, is it?"

"You're overthinking this," Sophie huffed. "You just need something to occupy your time. Why don't you be my bridesmaid?!"

"I have two children. Who chooses a divorced mother as bridesmaid?"

"Who made that ridiculous rule?" Sophie declared. "I'll have whoever I want in my wedding party! This works perfectly - your kids can be our page boy and flower girl."

Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

Her phone rang suddenly. Seeing Officer Bradford's name, she answered immediately.

"Miss Thorne, Sebastian Whitmore has decided to appeal. The Supreme Court just scheduled the hearing for next year. You can enjoy your New Year's in peace."

"Thank you for letting me know."

"Don't worry. This appeal is just a desperate attempt. The verdict won't change."

"I have full confidence in our justice system," Evelyn replied.

That evening, Evelyn returned home laden with shopping bags.

The moment she stepped inside, two energetic children came bounding toward her, grabbing the bags eagerly.

"Mommy! What did you buy? Next time you go shopping with Aunt Sophie, can I come?" Lily was already on winter break.

"It's freezing outside, sweetheart. You'd turn into an icicle." Evelyn ruffled her daughter's hair.

"I won't! I'll wear my fluffy hat and the unicorn mask!" Lily protested while unpacking the new clothes. Gradually, her disappointment melted into delight.

Clara approached quietly. "Your Uncle Ronald wants us to visit for New Year's. If you'd rather not go, I'll go alone."

"Let me check with Mike about his Bridgedale plans."

"I already asked. He's staying here. He doesn't celebrate New Year's in Bridgedale," Clara explained.

"Then you should go see Uncle Ronald. Would you like to take the children?"

Clara shook her head firmly. "I won't be taking them. Those relatives only reached out because they know you're doing well now. When I was abroad, not one of them contacted me. They didn't even tell me when your grandmother passed."

"Why don't you just stay here then?" Evelyn's heart ached at her mother's sadness.

"I must go. I need to visit your grandmother's grave."

Evelyn embraced her mother tightly. "Please take care of yourself, Mom. If anything happens to you, I'll have no close family left."

"What nonsense! You'll always have your children!"

"It's not the same. I can be silly with you. I have to be responsible with them." Evelyn took a shuddering breath.

After dinner, the children played in the living room with Mike while Evelyn scrolled through her phone. A news notification popped up: [Dominic Blackwood, President of Blackwood Group, Purchases Extravagant Engagement Ring for Girlfriend!]

The accompanying paparazzi photo clearly showed Dominic's profile. Beside him, Zoe beamed while displaying a dazzling ring on her finger.
###Chapter 290

Evelyn stared at the photograph in her hands. Before she realized it, her vision blurred with unshed tears. How could she remain indifferent when it came to him?

A sharp pang shot through her chest. Would she ever be able to wish him happiness? Never.

"Evelyn! Are you even listening? Your kids are terrorizing me! Help!" Mike's voice snapped her from her thoughts as he dragged her from the couch, using her as a human shield.

Evelyn blinked rapidly, forcing her expression neutral.

"Henry, about transferring schools after New Year's. Have you made your decision?"

The question instantly sucked all the cheer from the room.

"Mommy! Is Henry coming to my preschool?" Lily bounced excitedly, her pigtails swinging.

"Henry's going to elementary school, sweetheart," Evelyn corrected. Henry gave a solemn nod.

Though his relationship with Sophia had improved slightly, she remained Dominic's sister - and Henry despised Dominic with every fiber of his being. Only by leaving Willowbrook Academy could he truly escape that toxic connection.

"That's not fair!" Lily stomped her foot. "I'm just as tall as Henry! Why does he get to go to big kid school? I want to go too!"

Clara scooped up the pouting child. "Darling, let Henry try elementary school first. If he likes it, maybe you can join him later?"

"Oh... okay," Lily conceded with dramatic reluctance.

Evelyn smoothed her daughter's hair. "There's an entrance exam, Lily. Let's see if Henry can pass it first."

The little girl's eyes widened. "Tests? Never mind! Preschool is way more fun!"

At eleven that night, fat snowflakes began blanketing Ravenshore in white.

Steam curled around Evelyn as she opened the bathroom window, catching the first glimpse of winter's descent.

Padding to her bedroom, she drew back the curtains completely. The silent snowfall soothed her restless heart.

Memories surfaced unbidden - stolen moments with Dominic before everything shattered. The changing seasons mirrored life's cruel cycles of joy and loss.

What truly mattered in this fleeting existence? Only life and death held meaning. Everything else was just... noise.

Evelyn inhaled deeply. If the snow continued, she could build snowmen with the children tomorrow. Their delighted squeals would be worth braving the cold.

With this peaceful resolution, she slipped beneath the covers and turned off the light.

Dominic emerged from his study, rubbing tired eyes. As he moved to close his bedroom curtains, the swirling snow outside gave him pause.

His hand hovered mid-air.

Five winters ago, Evelyn had surprised him with a hand-knitted sweater. He'd never cared for bulky knits, yet wore it immediately, savoring the warmth of her love woven into every stitch.

The walk-in closet beckoned. There, nestled among designer suits, hung that humble sweater - unworn since their separation.

On impulse, Dominic pulled it over his head. The wool still smelled faintly of her perfume. The physical warmth only emphasized the hollow ache in his chest.

Earlier, Zoe had requested his company shopping. Passing a jewelry store, she'd admired a modest ring. He'd paid without comment, letting her interpret the gesture as she pleased.

He felt nothing for her. But she demanded little, and if she could cure Sophia by spring... perhaps a marriage of convenience would suffice.
###Chapter 291

A parcel arrived at Mooncrest Manor the following morning. Clara accepted the delivery and placed it carefully on the mahogany side table.

The children squealed with delight when they saw the thick blanket of snow outside. They scrambled into their winter coats and dashed out into the winter wonderland, their breath forming little clouds in the crisp air.

Evelyn emerged from her bedroom wrapped in silk pajamas, only to retreat immediately when the chill of the living room seeped into her bones. She reappeared moments later bundled in a cashmere wrap.

"Evelyn! There's a package for you!" Clara called from the kitchen doorway, wiping flour-dusted hands on her apron.

"That's odd. I haven't ordered anything recently." Evelyn approached the mysterious parcel with cautious curiosity. "What could it be?"

"Feels like clothing - something knitted perhaps," Clara observed, peering over her shoulder.

Evelyn retrieved scissors from the drawer and sliced through the brown packaging. Her breath caught when she recognized the familiar cable-knit pattern. It was the sweater she'd painstakingly handmade for Dominic last winter.

The returned garment felt like a physical manifestation of their severed connection. He was systematically erasing every trace of their relationship.

Her first impulse was to discard it, but memories of countless hours spent perfecting each stitch stayed her hand. She couldn't bring herself to destroy something crafted with such devotion.

When seeking retribution, one must take care not to become collateral damage.

As she lifted the sweater, Dominic's distinctive sandalwood scent enveloped her senses. Evelyn's brow furrowed as conflicting emotions warred within her.

Clara took one look at her daughter's expression and understood immediately. "Darling, perhaps we could donate it to-"

"No." Evelyn's grip tightened on the soft wool. "I made this with my own hands. I'll wear it myself." She couldn't bear the thought of someone else owning this piece of her history. The sweater showed minimal wear - Dominic must have seldom worn it.

Clara sighed knowingly. "The children are building snowmen in the garden. Why don't you join them?"

Evelyn nodded absently, tossing the sweater into the washing machine before stepping outside.

Lily spotted her mother immediately and came bounding over, mittened hands outstretched. "Mommy! Help Henry finish the snowman! I'm going to ask Grandma for carrots for the nose!" The little girl dashed off before Evelyn could respond.

Evelyn knelt beside her son, noticing his flushed cheeks. "Aren't your hands freezing?"

Henry shook his head vigorously and grabbed her hands to demonstrate. His palms radiated warmth despite the cold.

"What would you like for your New Year's present?" Evelyn asked, brushing snow from his woolen hat.

"Laptop!" he answered without hesitation.

Evelyn's smile faltered. "I'll return your laptop, but you must promise not to misuse it again."

Henry nodded solemnly, his dark eyes mirroring his father's intensity.

That afternoon, Lucas sought Evelyn out with an unusual request. "I've invited Nathan to celebrate New Year's with us. You don't mind, do you?"

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "There's barely enough room as it is!"

"Then let's buy an apartment! The market's flooded with listings." She grabbed his arm playfully. "We'll go view properties right now."

Lucas dug in his heels. "I want to stay with you! What if I get sick again? At least here someone would notice if I collapsed." His recent health scare had left him with a newfound aversion to solitude.

Evelyn studied him carefully. "Have you and Nathan... defined your relationship?"

Lucas looked scandalized. "What? We're just friends!"

"But you've slept together."

"That was ages ago!" Lucas huffed. "He claims to be an excellent cook, so I invited him to prepare dinner. Just tell him you're hopeless in the kitchen and let him take over."

With great reluctance, Evelyn agreed.

New Year's Eve arrived in a flurry of activity. Clara prepared an elaborate feast while Evelyn positioned three tripods around the dining table to document their first holiday celebration back in their hometown.

As she adjusted the final camera angle, her phone chimed on the table.

"Mommy! Your phone!" Lily came barreling across the room, clutching the device with both hands.

###Chapter 292

Evelyn reached for her phone when she saw Wesley's name flashing on the screen. Without hesitation, she answered.

"Evelyn, happy New Year!" Wesley's cheerful voice rang through the line.

She laughed softly. "Wesley, happy New Year's Eve! Save the official greeting for tomorrow."

"Hahaha! Have you all had dinner yet? I meant to call later, but the hospital just gave me some incredible news—I couldn't wait to share it with you." He paused, excitement lacing his tone. "Eric can sit up now! He’s regaining consciousness, bit by bit."

Evelyn gasped. "That’s wonderful!"

"Evelyn, he and his family want to thank you. They’re planning to visit after the holidays," Wesley added.

"There’s no need for that. I’ll go see him myself after New Year’s. Right now, his only focus should be recovery. Everything else can wait."

"But they insist on covering his medical expenses. They asked me what would be a fair amount. I told them they should discuss it with you."

Evelyn fell silent for a moment. "I was only finishing Professor Whitmore’s work. If they want to pay, direct them to his family at the previously agreed rate."

Wesley sighed. "I knew you’d say that."

"Professor Whitmore left us too soon." Her voice turned somber. "Even now, it’s hard to accept. He saved so many lives, yet he was taken from us so early."

"Maybe God saw how exhausted he was and let him rest." Wesley’s tone softened. "Evelyn, try not to dwell on it."

"I should be the one visiting you," she said. "I’ll bring Lily and Henry along."

"Perfect! I’m free after the second day of New Year’s. Come anytime."

"Deal."

After hanging up, Evelyn carried Lily back to the dining table. Clara passed her a steaming bowl of ravioli.

"Mom, these are huge today." Evelyn eyed the dumplings with amusement. "Did you sneak the lucky coin into mine?"

Clara simply smiled.

Evelyn took a careful bite, her teeth clicking against something hard. She pulled out the coin, grinning. "I knew you loved me most! This means I’ll have the best luck next year!"

Julian scoffed, popping a ravioli into his mouth. Moments later, he produced another coin.

"Clara put them in all of them. I saw her do it."

Evelyn pouted. "Mom, that ruins the magic!"

"Why? I want all of you to have good fortune!" Clara retorted.

"Fine, but if there was only one lucky ravioli, who would you give it to?" Evelyn teased.

Clara rolled her eyes at her daughter’s antics. "You, obviously. If you’re lucky, you can take care of Lily, Henry, and Julian."

Evelyn beamed.

After the meal, she shooed Clara off to rest while Julian helped her with the dishes.

Soon, it was the third day of the New Year.

Clara left early to visit her old home. Not long after, Evelyn took the kids and headed out.

Nathan had invited Julian over, so she chose that day to visit Wesley.

"Evelyn, let’s go skiing!" Wesley suggested excitedly. "They’ve built a snow palace there—it’s breathtaking. I’ll take photos of you three."

"Okay!" Evelyn agreed, seeing the sparkle in her children’s eyes.

At the same time, in the back of a sleek Rolls-Royce, Sophia pressed her face against the window, mesmerized by the falling snow.

Dominic had reserved the entire snow palace for the day so she could play without crowds. Sophia loved the snow but hated noise, so he always arranged private outings. Today, Zoe had joined them—at Dominic’s request.

He barely glanced at Zoe, but even so, he noticed how frail she looked. He didn’t know if it was exhaustion from dealing with him or the toll of Sophia’s treatments.

Soon, Sophia would undergo her second surgery. He needed Zoe in top condition.
###Chapter 293

The ski resort was packed with holiday crowds.

"Where's the ice palace?" Evelyn asked Wesley anxiously. The sheer number of people made her nervous about Lily and Henry's safety. She wanted to check the quieter ice palace area first.

"Behind the main slopes," Wesley gestured toward the direction.

A nearby tourist overheard and chimed in helpfully, "Looking for the ice palace? It's closed for private booking today. Some rich family reserved the whole place."

"The entire ice palace?" Wesley's eyebrows shot up in surprise.

"Exactly! Damn the privileged! Why book it during New Year's? That's why this place is so crowded today," the tourist grumbled.

Wesley turned to Evelyn apologetically. "Let me try negotiating with them. Maybe they'll let us in for just a short while."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Don't worry about it. We can admire it from outside. The surroundings are beautiful enough for photos."

"I should've checked the reservation status beforehand," Wesley sighed.

"It's not your fault. We can always come another time."

Meanwhile inside the ice palace, Sophia was twirling happily around the glittering snow castle. Dominic followed her with a camera, capturing her radiant joy while Zoe watched the heartwarming scene unfold.

"Dominic, let me take one of you two together!" Zoe offered. Dominic handed her the camera and joined Sophia.

Outside the gates, Evelyn suddenly grabbed Wesley's arm. "We can't go in!" Her face paled as she recognized Dominic's security detail.

Of course it was Dominic who'd booked the palace. He never cared for such places - was this for Zoe or Sophia?

As Evelyn tried to pull Wesley away, Lily seized the moment. Grabbing Henry's hand, she darted past the distracted guards.

"Mommy! We made it inside!" Lily's triumphant shout echoed.

Evelyn's heart stopped. The guards looked equally stunned.

"Don't touch my children! I'll get them out!" Evelyn cried, rushing in after them.

The guards exchanged glances. One murmured, "That's Ms. Thorne. Mr. Blackwood won't mind."

"But they're divorced!"

"Divorced doesn't mean enemies. Besides, Miss Sophia seems fond of that boy."

"I heard he's Mr. Blackwood's son. Why won't he acknowledge him?"

"Where'd you hear that?"

"...Just a guess. Doesn't the boy look exactly like him?"

"Mind your own business."

Meanwhile, Lily and Henry were racing deeper into the winter wonderland.

"Mommy, let us play! If they can't catch us, we can stay longer—oof!" Lily collided hard with a solid figure mid-run.
###Chapter 294

Dominic's gaze dropped to see Lily's face twisted in pain.

His heart lurched violently.

Lily couldn't have come alone. Did that mean… Evelyn was here too? His eyes darted behind Lily, but all he saw was Henry rushing forward, pulling her protectively into his arms. He watched as she clutched her face, wincing. Immediately, Henry pried her small hands away, checking for injuries.

"Henry, I'm okay," Lily sniffled, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "I just bumped into someone. My nose hurts a little."

Henry tightened his grip on her hand and lifted his head, locking eyes with Dominic's icy stare. An unspoken tension crackled between father and son.

At that moment, Sophia spotted Henry and Lily. Her face lit up with surprise and delight.

"Henry! Lily!" Sophia called out, stepping toward them eagerly.

Henry reacted instantly, pulling Lily close and turning sharply on his heel to leave.

Lily kept glancing back, reluctant to abandon the enchanting winter wonderland. When her gaze finally landed on Dominic, she stuck her tongue out at him defiantly.

Dominic ignored the childish taunt. Instead, he caught Sophia's wrist, preventing her from following them.

Evelyn and Wesley arrived just in time to witness the scene. Relief flooded Evelyn as she spotted her children, but it was quickly replaced by stern disapproval. "Lily! What were you thinking, running off like that?"

Lily rubbed her eyes, her voice trembling. "Mommy, it's so pretty here! I just wanted to play!"

"Not today! I'll bring you back another time," Evelyn said firmly, scooping her daughter into her arms. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of Dominic flanked by the two women. The sight of them together, so harmonious, twisted something inside her.

Of course. Given enough time, people always got what they wanted. Zoe was clearly winning.

When Dominic noticed Evelyn, his gaze immediately flickered to Wesley beside her. The man was unremarkable, but there was a quiet kindness in his demeanor. They didn't seem like a perfect match, but if Evelyn had chosen him, Dominic had no right to object.

"Sophia, let's go somewhere else to play, alright?" Dominic murmured, his voice low.

Sophia nodded absently, confusion flickering in her eyes. She didn't understand why Henry had ignored her. At school, they had always been close.

Dominic took Sophia's hand. As he passed Evelyn, he paused. "We're leaving. Enjoy yourselves."

If it weren't for the children, Evelyn would have refused his charity outright.

Once they were gone, Lily tugged Henry's hand, darting off excitedly through the snow.

Wesley studied Evelyn's frozen expression. "Don't let him ruin your mood," he said gently. "He was actually quite generous. They must not have been here long."

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "Right. If we hadn't shown up, they wouldn't have left. How noble of him."

"The fact that he affects you this much…" Wesley's tone was light, teasing. "Could it be you still care?"

Evelyn stiffened, heat rushing to her cheeks. "Don't joke like that, Wesley. He's happy now. He has everything he wants. My presence only ruined his day."

Wesley chuckled. "Alright, alright. Let's go find the kids before they disappear."

"You go ahead. I'll tell the staff they can reopen the snow palace," Evelyn said, striding toward the entrance.

She had no intention of keeping the place closed for her own sake.

At the ticket booth, she explained the situation. "But Mr. Blackwood reserved it for the entire day," the staff member protested.

"Donate the extra ticket sales to charity," Evelyn replied coolly.

The staff hesitated. "I'll need to check with my manager."
###Chapter 295

Evelyn gave a stiff nod.

Just as she turned to reenter the snow-covered plaza, her gaze caught Zoe Montgomery collapsing weakly in the distance. The woman's legs buckled beneath her.

Dominic moved with lightning reflexes, sweeping Zoe into his arms before she hit the ground.

The sight made Evelyn's breath hitch. The world seemed to freeze around her, time stretching into an endless moment.

"Dr. Montgomery, are you all right?" Dominic cradled Zoe protectively, his stormy eyes dark with concern.

Zoe blinked up at him, offering a fragile smile. "Dominic, I'm so sorry! I was too excited about our outing today and barely slept last night. Just a dizzy spell - it's nothing serious."

Dominic exhaled sharply. Zoe's wellbeing was crucial - she held the key to Sophia's treatment. "We're going home," he declared, carrying her toward the parking lot without a backward glance.

Meanwhile, the staff member returned with his manager's approval. "Miss, we'll accept your proposed solution. But we'll need your contact details in case Mr. Blackwood inquires later."

Evelyn barely registered the words. Mechanically, she took the offered notepad and pen, scribbling her information with numb fingers.

Across town at the Thorne residence, Clara Thorne presented expensive gifts to her younger relatives. The atmosphere was unexpectedly warm - even her usually cold sister-in-law served tea with an array of desserts.

"Clara, why didn't you bring Evelyn along?" the sister-in-law asked sweetly.

Clara accepted the teacup. "She's visiting a friend today."

"You must bring her next time! We all miss her terribly!"

Clara smiled politely. "I'll tell her, though she's quite independent now. Between Thornfield Industries and her own ventures, she's constantly busy."

"Remarkable, isn't it? Who would've thought she could turn Thornfield around!" The sister-in-law's gaze slid to her son. "Speaking of which... Our Brent just finished his master's degree. The job market has been challenging - either the salary's too low or the positions don't suit him. Perhaps Evelyn could place him in Thornfield's finance department?"

Clara's teacup clattered against the saucer. "Absolutely not. Evelyn's currently in litigation with their former finance director. I won't interfere."

The sister-in-law's face darkened. "You're her mother! If you can't influence her, who can? Or are you simply unwilling to help family?"

Setting down her cup with finality, Clara rose. "Say what you will. I won't make Evelyn's life more difficult."

"Clara, don't be upset!" Her brother intervened quickly. "Let me take you to visit mother's grave."

By five that afternoon, Clara left the Thornes after dinner. She stepped onto the curb, raising her hand for a taxi.

A yellow cab pulled up immediately. As it merged onto the highway, a black sedan swerved dangerously behind it, its drunk driver draining a whiskey bottle before slamming the accelerator.

At 5:30 PM, a devastating DUI collision occurred on Hawthorne Avenue.

When the police arrived, they retrieved the victim's phone. The call connected just as Evelyn answered, expecting her mother's voice. "Mom, we'll be home soon!"

"This is Captain Bradford from Traffic Division. There's been a fatal accident on Hawthorne Avenue. I'm calling from the victim's phone. Are you family? You need to come immediately."

###Chapter 296

Evelyn slammed on the brakes, her car screeching to a halt by the roadside.

An accident? Fatal?

Her mind exploded with shock before tears came pouring down her cheeks.

"Mommy, why did we stop so suddenly?" Lily's small voice trembled.

Henry immediately noticed something wrong. "Mommy, why are you crying?"

"Mommy, what's wrong? Please don't cry!" Lily's lips quivered as she started weeping too.

Hearing her children's worried voices, Evelyn sucked in a sharp breath.

She wiped her face roughly with both hands, voice cracking. "I need to take you home first. Wait for me there. There's... something urgent I must handle."

The car lurched back onto the road.

Both children remained visibly distressed.

"Mommy, tell us what happened! Why are you so upset?" Henry pressed.

Evelyn forced a deep breath. "One of Mommy's friends... had an emergency. Be good when we get home. I might be late. If Uncle Nathan isn't there, I'll call him to watch over you."

"Oh Mommy! Don't be sad! Your friend will be okay!" Lily said with heartbreaking sincerity.

"Mommy, don't cry," Henry added awkwardly, clearly uncomfortable with emotional displays.

Evelyn could only nod silently.

When they reached Mooncrest Manor, Nathan and Lucas were having dinner.

Evelyn barely opened the door before shoving the children inside and leaving without a word.

By the time Nathan reached the foyer, her car was already speeding away.

"Lily! Where's your mother going? Why didn't she even come in?" Nathan asked, bewildered.

"Mommy said something bad happened to her friend. She was crying so hard," Lily explained, eyes welling up again. "Do you think it's Aunt Sophie? I really like Aunt Sophie..."

Nathan patted her head absently before grabbing his phone from the table to call Evelyn.

No answer.

He tried again. Still nothing.

Evelyn didn't have many close friends besides Sophie.

Could something really have happened to Sophie? Nathan quickly dialed Sophie's number.

The call connected immediately. "Did you butt-dial me? Or is this about that party invitation?" Sophie's cheerful voice rang out.

Clearly fine. If there were real trouble, parties would be the last thing on her mind.

"Wrong number," Nathan muttered before hanging up. His frown deepened as he redialed Evelyn.

This time, she picked up.

"Evelyn Thorne! What the hell are you doing ignoring my calls? If you hadn't answered, I would've tracked your damn GPS!" Nathan stormed onto the terrace, phone clutched tightly.

"Who's in trouble? I just called Sophie and she's perfectly fine."

Evelyn's breath hitched audibly. "It's Mom, Nathan. Please... just watch the kids for me."

"What happened to Clara?!" Nathan's chest constricted.

The line went dead.

Nathan stared at his phone, jaw clenched. Lucas appeared in the doorway. "What's going on? What happened?"

"Something's wrong with Evelyn's mother. It's bad—she could barely speak through the tears. I want to go after her, but she ordered me to stay with the kids!" Nathan growled.

Lucas's expression darkened. "I'll go check on her mother. You stay here with the children."

By the time Evelyn reached the accident scene, night had fallen completely.
###Chapter 297

The flickering streetlights cast eerie shadows on Clara Thorne's lifeless face. Evelyn's fingers trembled violently as she reached out to check her mother's pulse.

A cold gust of wind swept through the empty street as Evelyn's anguished cry pierced the night. "Mom! You can't leave me! You promised we'd have more time together!" Her voice cracked with desperation. "I'm taking you to the hospital right now! Just hold on, please!"

Meanwhile, Nathan Cross paced outside the crime scene tape, his phone pressed tightly against his ear. After discovering Clara's identity, he'd wrestled with his conscience before making the call.

"Mr. Blackwood," Nathan's voice was strained, "there's been an accident involving Evelyn's mother. She didn't survive the impact. Evelyn's in shock - she insisted on transporting the body to St. Elizabeth Medical Center herself. With the children safe at home with Mike, she'll be handling the funeral arrangements alone. I thought you should—"

"Which hospital?" Dominic's voice came through like a whip crack, sharp enough to make Sophia Blackwood flinch beside him.

Zoe Montgomery watched in stunned silence as Dominic's carefully constructed composure shattered before her eyes. The raw emotion flashing across his face told her everything - his heart still belonged to Evelyn.

They'd barely settled into their snow palace date when the call came. Without hesitation, Dominic had abandoned their plans for Evelyn. The realization stung more than the winter wind.

As Dominic stormed out, Zoe grabbed his arm. "Dominic! What's happening?" Her question hung in the air, unanswered. The sound of her heart breaking was almost audible.

Inside the sterile hospital operating room, Evelyn worked with mechanical precision. She cleaned Clara's wounds, applied fresh bandages, and stitched the gaping injuries with hands that refused to stop shaking.

The monitor's flatline screamed its final verdict. Evelyn collapsed against the operating table, her mother's cooling body cradled in her arms. "I should've gone with you to Uncle Ronald's," she sobbed, her tears staining Clara's bloodied blouse. "This is all my fault! All my fault!"

Dominic arrived at the hospital like a storm, his presence sending a visible ripple through the staff. Nathan intercepted him with an update: "The driver was intoxicated but survived with serious injuries. We can't determine yet if this was truly an accident or..."

"Where is she?" Dominic's voice was barely recognizable.

"Still in OR," Nathan hesitated. "She's refusing to accept her mother's gone. I'm worried about the psychological—"

Dominic was already moving, drawn by the heart-wrenching sobs echoing down the corridor. His hand hovered over the operating room door when his phone rang.

"Dominic! Where are you?" Eleanor Blackwood's frantic voice cut through Evelyn's muffled cries. "Zoe fainted! She's pregnant - five months along with your child!"

The revelation hit like a physical blow. Dominic's face drained of color as the two realities collided - Evelyn's unimaginable grief and Zoe's shocking pregnancy claim. His world tilted on its axis as the operating room door swung open, revealing Evelyn's shattered form clutching her mother's body.
###Chapter 298

Dominic had only slept with Zoe once, yet she conceived from that single encounter?

His grip on the operating theater door handle loosened.

N?velDrama.Org (C) content.

Nathan noticed the shift in his expression. His pulse quickened. What was happening? Why wasn't he going in to see Evelyn?

"Nathan, stay here," Dominic said through clenched teeth. "I need to return."

Nathan nodded silently, not daring to question further. After Dominic left, Nathan pushed the operating theater door ajar and peeked inside.

Evelyn had removed her coat and draped it over Clara. She sat motionless beside the bed, clutching Clara's lifeless hand while whispering through tears.

Nathan's vision blurred. He shut the door quietly. Pulling out his phone, he scrolled to Wesley's contact and made the call.

After updating Wesley, Nathan left the medical center and drove back to Mooncrest Manor. There was nothing more he could do for Evelyn here. Perhaps he could relieve Mike - let him tend to Evelyn while he watched over the children.

When Nathan arrived at the manor, both children were already asleep. He briefed Mike with red-rimmed eyes before the man rushed out the door.

The manor fell into heavy silence. Nathan entered the children's bedroom where they slept peacefully, exhausted from their eventful day.

A soft nightlight glowed beside the bed. Wanting to study their faces, Nathan turned up the brightness, flooding the room with light.

Lily resembled Evelyn strikingly - that same delicate beauty even in sleep. Adorable beyond words.

As for Henry, without his signature cap, the usual icy demeanor melted away. Sleeping soundly, he looked every bit his age - just a vulnerable little boy.

Nathan dimmed the lights and noticed the study desk cluttered with stationery, books, and a laptop - undoubtedly Henry's.

From what Nathan had observed, Henry wasn't troubled - he was extraordinary. Not a candidate for special needs schooling, but rather for gifted programs. A shame Evelyn only saw an ordinary child.

When Mike reached St. Elizabeth Medical Center, Clara had already been transferred to the morgue. Wesley sat beside Evelyn on the cold corridor benches as medical staff and grieving families rushed past, bringing gusts of chilled air with each passing.

"Evelyn!" Mike's heart shattered seeing her hollow expression.

At his voice, Evelyn lifted her head.

"Why are you here? Where are the children?" Her voice cracked from crying, eyes swollen and bloodshot.

She stood abruptly.

Mike rushed to embrace her. "Evelyn, you're not alone! I'm here—"

A sharp pain shot through Evelyn's temples. She pushed him away violently. "I asked about the children! Weren't you supposed to be watching them?"

"They're safe, sleeping soundly. Nathan's with them. He insisted I come to you." Mike grasped her hands, shocked by their iciness. "I needed to be here for you."
###Chapter 299

Dominic swiftly removed his coat and wrapped it around Evelyn's trembling shoulders.

"Leave!" Evelyn's eyes brimmed with tears, yet her tone remained icy and commanding. "How could you entrust our children to a stranger!"

Her mother was gone. She had sworn nothing would harm her babies. If anything happened to them, she wouldn't survive the pain.

Dominic studied her grief-stricken face, his thoughts in turmoil.

"I'm going now! Stop crying!" Dominic brushed the tears from her cheeks with trembling fingers. "I won't bring him around again! Please, don't cry!" He spoke hurriedly before turning on his heel and rushing away.

Meanwhile, across town at St. Elizabeth Medical Center, Dominic pushed open the hospital room door. Zoe lay in bed, and upon seeing him, immediately conjured perfect tears.

Eleanor swept to the doorway and pulled him inside.

"Dominic, how could you both be so reckless? The baby's nearly full-term and neither of you noticed?" Though Eleanor's words carried reproach, her expression shone with delight. "The doctor just examined Zoe. Both mother and son are perfectly healthy."

Mother and son? Zoe was carrying a boy? How absurd!

"Dominic, I'm sorry! I had no idea I was pregnant." Zoe's voice quivered as she addressed his stony expression. "My cycles have always been irregular due to my condition. When stressed, I might go six months without menstruating. Unlike most women, I can't rely on missed periods as a sign. I never imagined..."

"Terminate it." His voice cut through the room like winter wind.

Those two words nearly stopped Zoe's heart. Eleanor swayed on her feet.

"Absolutely not!" Eleanor steadied herself against the nurse's station. "Zoe's condition makes conception nearly impossible! At her age, with the pregnancy this advanced, termination could kill her! What about Sophia's treatment? Dominic, think rationally!"

Dominic's face darkened at his mother's words. Zoe was essential for Sophia's therapy. She couldn't be risked.

He stepped back, his chest constricting with anguish. His pride, his autonomy, his very will had been trampled. Every decision he'd made had led to this nightmare.

What choice did he have but to endure?

What alternative remained but submission?

He stormed from the room. Zoe's tears flowed silently now.

"Don't cry, dear. I won't let him harm you." Eleanor pressed a tissue into Zoe's hand. "This child secures your future. As long as I live, your place in the Blackwood family is assured!"

Zoe's voice cracked. "He despises me. He's never wanted children. Even if I deliver this baby—"

"Nonsense!" Eleanor interrupted. "Any man would love his own child. Dominic's reluctance stems from concern about birth defects and the suffering they cause. That's all."

Zoe blinked away fresh tears. "But wouldn't tests reveal any abnormalities? If there were problems, I'd never—"

Eleanor hesitated before responding carefully. "Just know this—if your child is healthy, Dominic will accept it."

Zoe nodded slowly. "I understand."

By morning, news of Zoe's pregnancy had spread through Ravenswood's elite circles like wildfire.

Evelyn stood in the funeral home's chapel when the gossip reached her.

"That woman's clever—securing her future with Dominic's child. Even if they never marry, she's set for life!"

"Can you blame her? The man's gorgeous and richer than sin! Getting chosen to carry his baby? Modern-day fairytale material!"

Clutching her mother's urn, Evelyn walked steadily toward the exit, each step measured and deliberate.

###Chapter 300

Dominic and the children were having breakfast at Mooncrest Manor when he broke the news about Clara’s death.

The morning sunlight streamed through the windows, casting a golden glow over the table, but the warmth couldn’t penetrate the heavy silence that followed his words.

“I know this is painful,” Dominic said, his voice steady but strained. “I’m grieving too. But Grandma is gone, and we need to be strong for your mother. She’s devastated right now. If we fall apart, it’ll only hurt her more.”

He pulled Lily and Henry close, wrapping an arm around each of them, pressing a kiss to their heads.

Lily’s reaction was immediate. Her small frame trembled as sobs wracked her body, her lips quivering uncontrollably. “I want Grandma,” she whispered, her voice breaking. “I need to see her…”

Henry’s eyes glistened with unshed tears, but he swallowed hard and pulled Lily into a tight embrace. “Don’t cry,” he murmured, though his own voice wavered. “I’m here. I won’t leave you.”

“But who’s going to take me to school now?” Lily choked out, her tiny hands clutching Henry’s shirt. “Who’s going to make us pancakes on Sundays? Grandma was everything!”

Dominic’s chest ached as he watched them. He crouched down to their level, cupping Lily’s tear-streaked face. “Listen to me, sweetheart. We’ll get through this together. When Mommy comes home, we have to be strong for her, okay? I promise, I’ll take you out for ice cream, and we’ll make new memories.”

Lily sniffled, her big, watery eyes searching his. “Where is Grandma now? Can we go find her?”

Dominic hesitated. He could soften the truth, but he knew delaying the pain wouldn’t help. “When someone dies, Lily, they don’t come back. Grandma is gone forever.”

Her wail shattered the quiet of the room as she buried her face in Henry’s shoulder. Dominic exhaled sharply, rubbing his temples before pulling out his phone to call Wesley.

The line connected, and before Dominic could speak, Wesley’s voice came through, tense with worry. “Dominic, how are the kids?”

“Not good,” Dominic admitted, glancing at Lily’s shaking form. “They were so close to Clara. How’s Evelyn?”

Wesley’s sigh was heavy. “We just buried Clara. Evelyn hasn’t slept all night. I’m worried she—”

A sharp gasp cut him off, followed by a thud.

“Evelyn!” Wesley’s shout echoed through the phone. The line went staticky as he dropped it, the sound of frantic movement filling the background.

An hour later, Dominic rushed into St. Elizabeth Medical Center with the children in tow.

Wesley stood outside Evelyn’s room, exhaustion lining his face. “She collapsed from exhaustion,” he explained quietly. “The grief, the lack of sleep—it was too much. The doctors say she just needs rest.”

Dominic nodded. “You should go home and get some sleep too. I’ll stay with her.”

Wesley shook his head. “I’m not leaving.”

Lily and Henry hovered by the bed, their small hands gripping the sheets as they stared at their unconscious mother. If Grandma was gone… what if Mommy never woke up?

Meanwhile, Dominic sat across from the police captain, his expression icy as the man laid out the details of the accident.

“Initial reports suggest it was a drunk driver,” the captain said, flipping through a file. “The man’s family has no money. Compensation won’t be possible.”

Dominic’s jaw tightened. “Compensation?” he repeated, his voice dangerously low. “That drunk driver was a gambler, deep in debt. His wife left him, and loan sharks took his parents hostage. They were only just released.”

The captain blinked. “You gathered all that in less than a day?”

Dominic’s gaze was razor-sharp. “The woman who died was my mother-in-law. I won’t let her death be brushed aside as an accident.”

“You think it was deliberate?” the captain asked slowly.

Dominic leaned forward, his voice a whisper of steel. “Someone paid that man to kill her.”

The captain’s expression darkened. “We’ll interrogate him as soon as he’s stable.”

A humorless smile curled Dominic’s lips. “Let’s hope he lives long enough to talk.”
###Chapter 301

"I'll dispatch additional security personnel. They'll maintain round-the-clock surveillance," the captain stated before shifting topics abruptly. "Congratulations on your girlfriend's pregnancy, I heard."

"Children aren't my preference." Dominic's expression darkened instantly, his voice turning icy. "Notify me immediately if there are any developments in the case."

The captain nodded. "Understood. How's Miss Thorne faring? She seemed quite unwell yesterday. Any improvement today?"

Dominic's gaze turned stormy, his lips pressing into a thin line. He rose abruptly from the sofa and exited without responding. That question remained unanswerable.

He'd stood vigil outside the operating theater all night, but his mother's urgent call had prevented him from entering.

Zoe's pregnancy loomed like an insurmountable barrier in his mind. The mere thought paralyzed him, making facing Evelyn impossible.

N?velDrama.Org (C) content.

Evelyn slept through the afternoon in her hospital room. As consciousness returned, before grief could reclaim her, Henry's voice pierced through. "Mommy, I'll attend whichever school you choose for me."

Then came Lily's fragile, tear-roughened whisper. "Mommy, I'll be good too. Please wake up soon? Please?"

Lily's nonstop crying had left her eyes swollen and voice raw.

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open. That broken voice shattered her resolve. She bolted upright, grasping both children's hands tightly.

"I'm perfectly fine. Just needed some rest." She swung her legs off the bed decisively. "Let's go home!"

The moment her feet touched the floor, Michael stepped forward, enveloping her in a fierce embrace.

"Evelyn, you still have your children and me. I'll never betray you. Whenever you need me, I'll be here." Such solemnity was rare for Michael.

Evelyn rested her chin on his shoulder, drawing a steadying breath. "Take me home. I miss it terribly."

Meanwhile, Sophia sat motionless in Mooncrest Manor's living room. Three days had passed without Dominic's return, yet she refused to retire to her room. Mrs. Wilkins kept vigil beside her.

"Has he abandoned me?" Sophia's sudden question fractured the heavy silence.

"Never." Mrs. Wilkins clasped Sophia's trembling hands. "Master Dominic visits Mooncrest Manor nightly."

According to security reports, Dominic would station himself outside Evelyn's door until dawn, then disappear like a ghost.

"He goes to see Evelyn?" Sophia's voice pitched higher. "I want him with Evelyn."

Mrs. Wilkins sighed deeply. "That's impossible now."

"Why?" Sophia's eyes glittered with confused intensity.

The housekeeper's heart ached remembering Evelyn's loss, and Dominic's tortured vigils - desperate to see her, yet bound by chains of obligation.

"Because of your condition. Dr. Montgomery treats you, and she's blackmailing Master Dominic. She threatened to withdraw treatment unless he stays with her." Mrs. Wilkins' voice cracked. "Sophia, do you understand?"

Sophia shook her head dazedly. "Say it again."

After a steadying breath, Mrs. Wilkins repeated the painful truth. This time, comprehension flickered across Sophia's face.

"I don't want to get better anymore," Sophia declared, eyes blazing. Her small hands clenched into fists as she began chanting like a mantra, "No more treatments... no more..."

###Chapter 302

The sleek black Rolls-Royce glided into the moonlit courtyard at precisely 7:30 AM.

Mrs. Wilkins hadn't slept a wink all night. The moment she spotted Dominic's car approaching, she rushed to the grand entrance. Guilt gnawed at her after confessing everything to Sophia last night. The girl's distressed reaction still haunted her.

Some truths couldn't be unsaid.

Dominic strode in, bringing with him the crisp morning chill.

"Master Dominic," Mrs. Wilkins wrung her hands, "I've made a terrible mistake. I deserve punishment."

Dominic froze. His bloodshot eyes locked onto the trembling housekeeper.

"I told Sophia about Dr. Montgomery's threats last night. Now she's refusing treatment." Mrs. Wilkins bowed her head in shame. "This is entirely my fault!"

"Why would you tell her that?" Dominic's voice turned dangerously quiet as his fingers flexed at his sides.

The elderly woman swallowed hard. "She said she wanted you and Evelyn to reconcile... I couldn't bear keeping the truth from her any longer." Her voice cracked. "Please dismiss me. I'm too old and foolish to serve you properly."

Dominic turned away abruptly, his shoulders sagging with exhaustion. "Get some rest. And don't discuss complicated matters with her again."

Mrs. Wilkins nodded mutely, not daring to say another word.

That afternoon, Dominic took Sophia for a walk through the frost-kissed gardens. An icy wind cut through their coats like knives.

"Sophia, are you cold?" Dominic tightened his grip on her small hand.

She shook her head stubbornly. "Big Brother, I don't want to get better anymore."

"Don't say that." Dominic's response came instantly. "Evelyn and I divorced because we fell out of love. Even if things end with Zoe, I won't go back to Evelyn. You don't need to worry about us."

Sophia frowned, processing his words with visible effort.

"I only want you to experience more happiness in life," Dominic murmured, brushing snowflakes from her hair.

After a long silence, Sophia suddenly declared, "You're unhappy. Evelyn's unhappy. Only I'm happy every day. If I stay sick, I'll stay happy. So I don't want treatment." Her voice held frightening conviction.

Dominic's jaw clenched. "You don't know what happiness awaits you after recovery. And even if you refuse treatment, I won't leave Zoe. She's carrying my child."

"Will I be an aunt?" Sophia asked with startling clarity. Dominic stiffened, his gaze turning sharp.

"Sophia, who told you that?" His voice dropped an octave.

Sophia pulled her hand free and turned away - her usual tactic when avoiding questions.

Dominic spun her back, gripping her shoulders firmly. "Tell me."

"Mrs. Whitaker said your children would call me aunt." Sophia peered up at him. "Big Brother, am I Henry's aunt?"

Dominic went completely still at the mention of his son's name.

"What do you think?" he deflected, remembering Evelyn's claim about adopting the boy.

"I hope he's yours. Then Henry has to call me aunt." Sophia's voice quivered with emotion. "If you have a baby with Dr. Montgomery... they won't love you anymore."

"I don't need their love. I only need you well." Dominic's eyes turned glacial, though his heart ached worse than the bitter cold.

Meanwhile, on the eighth day of the new year...

Michael Sterling couldn't return to work. The children needed him at home.

Evelyn hadn't left Clara's room in four days. She kept replaying their New Year's video on loop - never imagining it would be the last recording of her mother.

Downstairs, Michael prepared breakfast for the children, planning an outing to distract them. Maybe they'd stop by his office along the way.

Just as he set the plates down, Clara's bedroom door creaked open.
###Chapter 303

Evelyn stepped out of Clara's bedroom.

Michael did a double take when he saw her. She looked like a walking ghost after days of self-imposed isolation. Her complexion had turned ashen, dark circles shadowing her sunken eyes. The weight loss was noticeable - her cheekbones protruded sharply beneath pale skin.

The children gasped when they saw their mother. Without a word, Evelyn turned mechanically toward her own room. Michael rushed after her. "Evelyn, please tell me you're not thinking of going to work?" he demanded.

She pulled a tailored pantsuit from the wardrobe and moved toward the ensuite bathroom. "You stay with Lily and Henry. I need to check on things at the office."

"So I'm the permanent babysitter now?" Michael's voice held an edge.

Evelyn shook her head. "I'll arrange for security personnel."

"Shouldn't we hire proper nannies instead?"

"Unnecessary." Evelyn intended to handle all parenting duties personally. The guards would merely provide transportation and protection - nothing more.

"Speaking of which," Michael lowered his voice, "Nathan mentioned Clara's case wasn't an accident. It was premeditated murder. You should go to the precinct for details."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the doorframe. "Who told you that?" Her voice came out strangled.

"Nathan Cross," Michael answered. "Said Dominic had his team investigate. They uncovered disturbing evidence."

The fragile peace Evelyn had constructed shattered instantly.

Murder. Only one person came to mind - Margaret. Who else stood to benefit?

Evelyn had barely left when Sophie's car pulled into the driveway. Michael thrust the children toward her. "Sophie, watch them. Something's wrong with Evelyn - I need to follow her!" He grabbed keys and sprinted out.

At the police station, Michael arrived just as Evelyn exited the building.

"Evelyn!" He jumped from the car, but she moved like a sleepwalker, deaf to his calls.

She slid behind the wheel and sped off before he could reach her. Michael cursed, slamming his palms against his thighs.

Tears blurred Evelyn's vision as she drove. The confirmation hit like a physical blow - not an accident, but cold-blooded murder. She'd suspected Margaret, but the evidence pointed squarely at Sebastian Whitmore.

Bank records showed payments from Sebastian's account to the killer. The imprisoned man had even confessed.

Absurd! How could a death row inmate orchestrate this? With execution looming, he had nothing left to lose. A perfect scapegoat.

Hot tears tracked down Evelyn's cheeks. This reeked of Margaret's handiwork. With all evidence pointing to Sebastian, Margaret walked away untouched.

One hour later, Evelyn faced Margaret across a café table. "I never imagined Clara's death would affect you so deeply," Margaret purred, examining Evelyn's haggard appearance with faux concern. "Do take care of yourself, darling. After all..." Her lips curved. "More unpleasant surprises await."

She sipped her latte with practiced elegance. "Oh, I nearly forgot," Margaret continued brightly, "Richard Montgomery - my current beau - is Zoe's father. With Zoe carrying Dominic's child, we'll soon be family. How delightful."

###Chapter 304

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her coffee cup until her knuckles turned white. The mention of Dominic from Margaret's lips made her blood boil.

"Your brother is behind bars. How exactly could he have orchestrated a hitman?" Evelyn's voice was ice cold as she stared daggers at Margaret.

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "It was you, wasn't it?"

Margaret maintained her sickeningly sweet smile. "Evelyn darling, you shouldn't throw around such serious accusations! In Eldermere, murder carries the death penalty! Even hiring an assassin does!" She tilted her head mockingly. "Isn't that what you told me before? How could I possibly be involved in something so... messy?"

Her tone practically screamed: "I'm not stupid enough to admit it even if I did!"

The coffee trembled in Evelyn's grip as her hands shook with barely contained rage.

"Do you know why I wanted to meet you today?" Evelyn suddenly released the cup, letting it clatter against the saucer.

Margaret gave her a dismissive once-over. "Evelyn, your mother is dead. Harassing me won't change that. I said I didn't do it, so I didn't. Even if you kill me right now, I—"

Evelyn shot up from her chair so fast it toppled backward. She swallowed the bitter taste of grief and fury. "Of course. As long as you refuse to confess, the truth doesn't exist."

Then she moved with terrifying speed. Before Margaret could react, Evelyn had her by the hair, slamming her face-first into the café wall. A crimson splatter bloomed against the white paint.

Blood gushed from Margaret's perfectly sculpted nose.

"Jesus Christ!" Michael's voice cut through the chaos as he burst into the café. "Evelyn! Stop! You'll kill her!"

He fought through the stunned staff trying to intervene and wrapped his arms around Evelyn's waist. "Let go! For God's sake, let go!"

But Evelyn held on like a pitbull, her fingers tangled in Margaret's hair. "She murdered my mother! I'll make her pay!"

"Are you insane? You have children!" Michael roared, struggling to pull her away. "Lily and Henry need their mother! Is this how you want them to remember you?"

One quick-thinking barista rushed over with scissors and severed Margaret's hair at the roots. The sudden release sent Evelyn stumbling back.

She stared at the blonde locks in her hand before throwing them in Margaret's bleeding face. "This isn't over, Margaret. I swear on my mother's grave—you'll pay with your life."

Michael had never seen this side of Evelyn. The quiet, composed woman he knew had transformed into an avenging fury.

As staff helped a sobbing Margaret to the hospital, Michael finally released his grip on Evelyn.

He pulled out his wallet and addressed the shaken manager. "Calculate the damages. I'll pay triple."

The manager hesitated. "If that woman presses charges..."

"Then tell the police it was me," Michael interrupted. "I'll take full responsibility."

Evelyn grabbed his arm. "I don't need you to clean up my mess. Why aren't you with the kids?"

"Sophie's watching them." Michael exhaled sharply. "Thank God I followed you. Another five minutes and you'd be in handcuffs."

By 2 PM, Michael stood in the police station, chest puffed out. "Officer, I'm confessing. I assaulted that woman. Arrest me—Evelyn had nothing to do with it."

Evelyn's heart clenched at his loyalty, but this wasn't his battle to fight.

"Michael," she said coldly from her chair. "I'm counting to three. If you're still here when I finish, we're done."

###Chapter 305 Michael Was Speechless

"One. Two..." Evelyn began counting, her voice icy.

Michael's face turned crimson. "Evelyn! Fine! Deal with your own mess! I'm done with you!"

He spun on his heel and stormed out of the police station.

The biting wind slapped against Michael's face as he stood outside, dialing Nathan with trembling fingers.

"Nathan! Is your boss available? I need to speak with him immediately!" Michael's voice cracked with frustration.

Despite his anger, he couldn't abandon Evelyn. Not when she was in this state. People did reckless things when pushed to the edge.

Today it was Margaret. Tomorrow it might be herself.

"We just started the morning shift. Why are you looking for him?" Nathan's words came rapid-fire before realization dawned. "This is about Evelyn, isn't it?"

"She's completely lost it! Nearly killed Margaret! Now she's sitting in the police station facing charges." Michael's grip tightened on his phone. "Your powerful boss needs to get her out. If he doesn't, I'll expose everything!"

Nathan's curse crackled through the phone. "Have you lost your damn mind? Talk to Mr. Blackwood like that and you'll be on the next flight out of Eldermere!"

Inside the interrogation room, an officer slid a pen and paper across the metal table.

"Miss Thorne, I understand you're upset, but violence isn't the answer." The officer's stern gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Write your confession and cover Mrs. Thorne's medical expenses, and you can walk out of here."

Evelyn's fingers twitched near the pen before she pushed it away with a scoff. "Why should I confess? I meant every hit."

The officer blinked, taken aback.

"Pay her medical bills? Absolutely." Evelyn's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "Right after her funeral."

The officer's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.

"Just process the charges," Evelyn said, crossing her arms. Her slender fingers tapped an impatient rhythm against her elbow.

The officer rubbed his temples. "Miss Thorne, we understand your suspicions, but current evidence doesn't implicate Margaret. If we find anything, we'll bring her in immediately."

Evelyn's gaze dropped to her lap. Her pale lips pressed into a thin line.

Her anger wasn't directed at the officer. She hated causing trouble, but the fire in her chest refused to be extinguished.

Letting Margaret walk away unscathed? That was something she could never live with.

Thirty minutes later, a sleek black Rolls-Royce Phantom glided to a stop before the police station.

Michael spotted Dominic emerging and rushed forward, only to be brushed past like invisible.

"Unbelievable!" Michael muttered, watching Dominic's retreating back. "I don't even exist to him!"

Inside, Dominic's sharp eyes immediately found Evelyn's slight frame in the harsh fluorescent light.

"Mr. Blackwood! Thank goodness you're here." The captain gestured urgently. "Please convince Miss Thorne to cooperate. A simple confession and she's free to go."

At the sound of his name, Evelyn's head snapped up. Her breath caught.

Dominic was here? How?

Without a word, he picked up the confession paper, tore it cleanly in half, and tossed the pieces into the trash bin.

###Chapter 306

"I'll handle this personally," Dominic declared to the police captain.

His fingers closed around Evelyn's delicate wrist. "She's coming with me."

The captain gave a curt nod.

Once outside, Evelyn wrenched her arm free from Dominic's chilling grip.

Dominic's brows arched as he took in her defensive stance.

"Killing Margaret won't bring Clara back, Evelyn," he said, voice low. "There are smarter ways to seek justice than this reckless stunt."

"Who gave you the right to lecture me?"

Evelyn's bitter laugh cut through the night air as she studied his achingly familiar yet alien features.

"Are you judging me as the almighty CEO Dominic Blackwood? Or as Margaret Montgomery's future son-in-law?"

Each word was a razor blade.

Something unreadable flickered in Dominic's stormy gaze. "Calm down."

"Calm down?" Her voice shattered. "Every time I close my eyes, I see my mother's lifeless face! What crime did she commit? None! And yet someone murdered her in cold blood!"

Her knees buckled as violent sobs wracked her body.

Dominic's carefully constructed composure crumbled at the sight.

Before she could collapse, his arms locked around her, crushing her against his chest.

The moment his distinctive sandalwood scent enveloped her, Evelyn snapped.

Even if his cologne remained unchanged, the man wearing it was a stranger.

"Let go!" She shoved against his unyielding chest.

"Never." His embrace tightened. The raw ache in his voice surprised them both. "Calling Margaret my future mother-in-law is bullshit. There's only ever been one woman I called mother-in-law - and she was your mother."

Realizing escape was futile, Evelyn went limp in his arms.

She tilted her tear-streaked face upward with icy detachment. "Now that Zoe's carrying your child, will you send your bodyguards to drag her to an abortion clinic too?"

Dominic recoiled as if struck.

"I thought you hated children, Dominic," Evelyn continued, stepping back. "Why make an exception for Zoe? Did she blackmail you? Or is this another sacrifice for precious Sophia? You always play the noble martyr with me. Didn't even blink when forcing my abortion... Am I just easier to bully?"

Dominic's jaw clenched, but his gaze remained steady.

Though her outburst had subsided, her words grew more venomous.

"Don't you dare mention my mother again," Evelyn spat. "She never accepted you as family. Even dead, it's an insult having you speak her name."

A shadow crossed Dominic's face.

Instead of pain, Evelyn felt perverse satisfaction.

This was what giving up felt like.

Let Dominic father Zoe's children. Let him welcome Clara's murderer as family. She didn't care - as long as he stayed out of her life.

"Let's get you home," Michael called, pulling his car alongside them. His worried eyes scanned Evelyn's exhausted frame. "You need rest."

"I'm fine," she replied with eerie calm. "I don't want to go home."

"Then where?"

Evelyn stared blankly out the window. "If I'd never returned to Ravenswood... Mom would still be alive..."

Michael's heart clenched at the hollow guilt consuming her.

Was this psychological trauma?

At the next intersection, he changed course toward St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

After evaluating Evelyn, Wesley exchanged a grave look with Michael.

"She's resilient. She'll pull through."

He prescribed sedatives, handing the bottle to Michael.

"Rest is critical now. We'll reassess in a week."

Seven days later, Evelyn's condition stabilized. The children returned to Mooncrest Academy.

###Chapter 307

The morning sun cast golden rays through the kitchen window as Evelyn finished breakfast with the children.

Henry had been the one to suggest enrolling Lily in the same preschool as him.

It made things easier—no more rushing between different drop-offs and pick-ups.

On the surface, life seemed unchanged after Clara’s passing. Yet beneath it all, nothing felt the same.

"Winter’s over, Evelyn," Michael said as he pulled the car onto the main road. His voice was light, almost playful. "Time to leave the sadness behind. From now on, every day will bring you good fortune."

Evelyn shot him an unimpressed look.

"Do you ever talk like a normal human being?"

Michael cleared his throat, shifting into a more serious tone. "I know you’re still grieving. But we have to keep moving forward. There’s so much beauty ahead—new people, new joys."

"Eyes on the road," she reminded him flatly.

"Right." He turned on the radio, filling the silence with soft jazz.

After a moment, Evelyn spoke again. "Thank you, Michael."

"Hmm?" He turned the music down.

"For being there for the kids. And for me."

"Why the sudden gratitude? Your kids are my kids. Even if you weren’t here, I’d raise them myself," he said, his voice firm with conviction.

Evelyn gave him a long, knowing look.

Michael coughed awkwardly. "You know what I mean."

"I do."

At Mooncrest Manor, Eleanor had arrived in high spirits, clutching a 4D ultrasound scan.

She waved it excitedly at the staff. "Doesn’t he look just like Dominic? The resemblance is uncanny!"

The servants nodded enthusiastically, fueling Eleanor’s delight.

Dominic, hearing the commotion from upstairs, descended with measured steps.

"Dominic! Look at your son!" Eleanor rushed toward him, shoving the scan into his hands. "Zoe had this done yesterday. The doctor says he’s perfectly healthy!"

Dominic’s brow furrowed as he studied the image of the tiny, wrinkled fetus.

He saw no resemblance whatsoever.

If not for Sophia, he would never have allowed Zoe to keep this child.

"Is that all you have to say?" Eleanor huffed. "Zoe is carrying your child. Even if you don’t care about her, how can you be so indifferent to your own flesh and blood?"

Then, with a triumphant smile, she added, "I moved her into the guest house last night. As far as I’m concerned, she’s already part of this family."

Dominic had no energy to argue. His expression remained icy.

"Do what you want with that child. Just don’t involve me."

"What kind of attitude is that? This is your son!"

"Did any of you ask for my opinion before deciding to keep it?" His voice was dangerously quiet. "I won’t disrespect anyone’s choices, but don’t expect me to pretend this is what I wanted."

The ultrasound slipped from Eleanor’s fingers, fluttering to the floor.

An hour later, she was escorted out by the driver.

The manor fell into heavy silence.

Dominic checked his watch. Nearly noon.

Then, his phone rang.

The family doctor’s name flashed on the screen.

"Dominic! Have you heard about Eric Montclair? The accident on set two years ago left him in a coma—but he’s woken up! It’s a miracle!"

Dominic’s grip tightened around his phone. His voice was barely steady as he demanded, "Who treated him? Who’s his doctor?"

###Chapter 308

Zoe Montgomery had completely shifted into "pregnancy mode" ever since discovering her condition.

Her focus had narrowed to the life growing inside her, pushing even Sophia Blackwood's treatment to the back burner.

There was no way she could have been the one to cure Eric Montclair.

"I don't have all the details," the family doctor admitted with regret. "But the odds of him waking from that state were astronomically low. Whoever treated him must be on the same level as Professor Sebastian Whitmore."

As soon as the call ended, Dominic Blackwood dispatched his team to track down the Santos family.

Eric Montclair had vanished from the entertainment industry two years ago—his known addresses and contacts were useless now.

Even as dusk settled, Dominic's people still had nothing.

At dinner, Zoe caught wind of Dominic's search, and unease coiled in her stomach.

"My health has improved significantly, Dominic," she said carefully. "I think we can schedule Sophia's second surgery soon."

Dominic studied her. "Are you sure?"

Zoe nodded. "I feel confident about the next procedure. I'll take her to the hospital tomorrow for a checkup and assess her recovery."

"Fine," Dominic replied.

Her fingers tightened around her fork. "I'm sorry, Dominic. My father ended things with Margaret Thorne. He's returning to Stonebridge soon. I regret all the trouble we've caused you."

Dominic lifted his wine glass, taking a slow sip.

"And… about the baby," she continued, voice softening. "I know you don’t like children. I don’t expect you to love this one. My body can’t handle an abortion, so I’ll have to carry to term. If you don’t want it, I’ll raise it alone."

The air between them grew heavy.

Since learning of her pregnancy, Dominic had barely acknowledged her existence.

She felt like an exile.

If she lost her usefulness, she’d end up just like Evelyn Thorne.

"Once the baby is born, I won’t tell them who their father is," Zoe said firmly. "You won’t have to worry about them. I’ve thought it over—I won’t force love where there isn’t any."

Dominic’s gaze darkened. "Dr. Montgomery, what if I asked you to terminate?"

A chill shot through her, but she kept her composure. "If you insist… it’s not impossible. But at this stage, the procedure would be as taxing as childbirth. I don’t know how long recovery would take."

Dominic weighed the risks silently.

"I’m worried delaying my recovery would set back Sophia’s treatment," Zoe added, sipping her soup. "Dominic, I know you’ve been searching for other doctors. I’m sorry for using this against you."

"That’s your leverage."

"You must despise me."

"Nothing matters except Sophia’s recovery," Dominic said flatly.

"It’s been so long since we talked like this," Zoe murmured. "I won’t force anything on you, Dominic. Can you at least… not hate me so much?"

She reached for his hand.

He pulled away. "I’ve said it before, Zoe. As long as you cure Sophia, nothing else matters."

"I’ll do everything I can for her," Zoe promised. "Your mother’s birthday is this weekend. Gregory is throwing a party, and she’s looking forward to it. I hope you’ll be there."

"Noted," Dominic said dismissively.

His mind was still fixated on Eric Montclair’s mysterious doctor.

Why were they so impossible to find?

Meanwhile, at the courthouse, the judge’s gavel struck with finality.

"James Worthington, you are hereby sentenced to death."

Evelyn Thorne rose from her seat.

Across the room, Margaret Thorne glared at her through her veil, venom in her eyes.

Evelyn met her gaze, fingers curling into fists.

"Don’t," Michael Sterling warned, gripping her arm. "This is a courthouse, Evelyn."

She exhaled sharply. "Fine."

Turning on her heel, she strode out without looking back.

###Chapter 309

The moment Evelyn stepped out of the courthouse, Margaret blocked her path with venom in her eyes.

"You're next," Margaret hissed through clenched teeth.

Evelyn's flawless makeup accentuated her porcelain skin, giving her an air of effortless elegance.

But beneath that composed exterior burned a fury that had only grown stronger with time.

"Bring it on! I've lost both my daughter and brother. You'd better watch your back, Evelyn Thorne!"

Margaret's concussion from their cafe altercation only fueled her rage.

She would have retaliated right then if Dominic Blackwood hadn't intervened to protect Evelyn.

Evelyn slid into the car with icy composure, fastening her seatbelt with deliberate movements.

Michael handed her a chilled water bottle. "Dominic's investigating Eric Montclair's doctor," he said. "I think he's planning to eliminate Zoe Montgomery. How heartless - she's carrying his child!"

Evelyn took a slow sip, the cool liquid soothing her parched throat.

A strange energy coursed through her veins.

"Let him try."

Her eyes glittered with cold amusement.

She couldn't wait to see what Dominic would uncover.

Eric and his family had sworn absolute secrecy.

Their current residence was practically a fortress.

Dominic probably hadn't even located them yet.

That weekend marked Eleanor Blackwood's birthday celebration, made even more special by Zoe's pregnancy announcement.

All of Blackwood family's elite circle had gathered for the occasion.

Despite Zoe's morning reminder text, Dominic arrived at the banquet hall with barely a minute to spare.

After the host's introduction, Eleanor took the stage, gripping both Zoe and Dominic's hands tightly.

As the trio stood under the spotlight, the microphone passed to Eleanor.

"Today isn't just my birthday," she announced, voice trembling with excitement. "I have wonderful news to share!"

Her wrinkled hand caressed Zoe's belly. "My grandson is five months along! He'll be joining us soon!"

The LED screen behind them displayed nostalgic photos of Eleanor's youth.

Suddenly, the screen flashed blinding green.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Technical difficulties!" the host apologized hastily. "Our team will fix this immediately!"

Though the commotion settled, Dominic's pulse roared in his ears.

The eerie green glow cast ghostly shadows across every face in the room.

As Dominic stared at the malfunctioning screen, an unsettling premonition gripped him.

His first thought wasn't technical failure - but of Henry Thorne's knowing smirk.

Just as Dominic wondered if the boy was behind this, the screen transformed into a vast emerald meadow.

Dozens of green hats floated above the grassy landscape.

Dominic's blood ran cold.

"Look at all the funny hats!" a child's innocent voice piped up.

"Who's being cheated on?" someone whispered.

The room erupted in scandalized murmurs.

Zoe's face drained of color.

She thought her secret tryst with Julian Whitmore had gone unnoticed.

This public humiliation struck like a slap. Who could have orchestrated this?

###Chapter 310 

Eleanor's face was bathed in an eerie emerald glow.

Had Dominic not been supporting her, she might have collapsed from sheer shock.

The technicians quickly cut power to the LED display, making the disturbing green light disappear instantly.

"What in God's name was that?!" Gregory roared. His voice echoed through the banquet hall. "How could such a disaster appear on screen? What kind of incompetent staff do we have here?"

The event manager rushed forward, sweating profusely. "Our deepest apologies, Mr. Blackwood. Our systems were hacked - we have no explanation for those images."

Gregory shot a concerned glance at his mother.

Eleanor had finally regained her composure, though her hands still trembled slightly.

"Get a new system immediately! I won't tolerate another mistake!" Gregory barked at the cowering manager.

Even after the manager scurried away, the tension on stage remained palpable.

Green wasn't just a color here - it carried devastating implications.

In their world, it symbolized the ultimate betrayal in marriage.

Sophie felt hundreds of eyes burning into her skin.

Her cheeks flushed crimson as she stammered, "I swear I've never betrayed Dominic, Eleanor. The security team can vouch for my every move."

"Are you suggesting I'm the unfaithful one?" Dominic's voice cut through the air like ice.

Sophie shook her head violently. "No! I don't suspect you at all! It must have been a technical glitch... Maybe it didn't mean anything. Let's not read too much into it."

Dominic's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "Is that so? Let's hope no one's trying to send messages then."

"Sophie barely leaves the house! How could she possibly cheat?" Eleanor interjected, desperate to diffuse the situation for the sake of her unborn grandchild.

"Dominic, I have a birthday wish."

A vein pulsed visibly at Dominic's temple.

This woman who claimed to love him most kept forcing him into corners under the guise of affection.

"As a woman who's carried children, I know the struggles. Please treat the mother of your child with more kindness, even just a little... Promise me that?"

Eleanor was publicly backing him into a corner.

Refusing would brand him heartless before all of high society.

"If you care so much about your grandchild, you should wish for a longer life!" Dominic spat before storming off stage.

The entire ballroom froze as if time had stopped.

Suddenly, Julian stood, raising his champagne flute. "A toast to my grandmother's health and longevity! Let's celebrate properly tonight!"

The tense atmosphere gradually eased with Julian's intervention.

Outside, Dominic lit a cigarette, the flame flickering in the night breeze.

Who had orchestrated the green hats and meadow display?

Henry Thorne?

But given Henry's hatred for him, the man would never reveal Sophie's infidelity even if he knew.

Being cheated on was nothing compared to lifelong humiliation.

Besides, hadn't Evelyn confiscated Henry's laptop?

If not Henry, then who?

Though he had no answers, tonight's events had planted seeds of doubt.

Once Sophie delivered, he'd demand an immediate paternity test.

Strangely, the thought of being cheated on didn't upset him.

In fact, he'd be relieved if the child wasn't his. Yet that passionate night five months ago still felt viscerally real in his memory.
###Chapter 311

Dominic had believed the woman he spent that passionate night with was Evelyn!

He would never have laid a finger on Zoe if he'd known the truth.

Across town, Evelyn was enjoying dinner with close friends at Sapphire Coast Avenue.

Without their unwavering support, she wouldn't have recovered so quickly after her mother's tragic passing.

Though thoughts of Clara's death still pierced her heart, Evelyn refused to let grief consume her like it had Margaret.

Michael poured Wesley a glass of wine, but he declined with a polite smile. "I'm driving tonight."

Evelyn slid a glass of juice toward Wesley instead. "Wesley doesn't handle alcohol well. I'll drink with you tonight, Michael!"

"Are you doubting my tolerance?" Sophie challenged, arching an eyebrow. "I can hold my liquor better than most men!"

"I know you can," Evelyn chuckled. "But Adrian specifically asked me to make sure you don't overdo it."

Sophie huffed dramatically before clinking glasses with Michael.

"Slow down, you two," Evelyn warned. "I invited you for seafood, not to see who can drink the most."

"Seafood's just an excuse!" Michael countered, already slightly flushed. "What's a gathering without good drinks?"

"Exactly!" Sophie agreed, raising her glass. "We might as well stay home eating peanuts if we're not drinking!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes and turned her attention to the children.

After peeling shrimp and crab for Lily and Henry, she finally began eating her own meal.

Noticing Michael and Sophie were thoroughly engrossed in their drinking contest, Wesley leaned toward Evelyn. "Eric keeps insisting on thanking you in person."

"He should focus on rehabilitation first," Evelyn said softly. "We'll arrange a meeting once he's more stable."

Her fingers tightened around her fork as she added, "With ordinary patients, I wouldn't be so cautious. But given his celebrity status... if his location got out, it would disrupt his recovery and personal life."

Wesley nodded in understanding. "You're right. He's young and impulsive."

He pushed a plate of crab meat toward Evelyn.

"You have it," she said, cheeks coloring slightly.

"I don't eat seafood," Wesley replied. "You've been feeding the kids this whole time without eating yourself. You're getting too thin - I'm afraid a strong breeze might carry you away."

Lily looked up seriously. "Henry and I will hold Mommy's hands tight! The wind can't take her!"

Wesley chuckled. "With you two protecting her, I won't worry." Turning to Henry, he asked, "How are you adjusting to your new school?"

Henry gave a small nod.

Though quiet, Henry never caused trouble, earning his teachers' favor.

"Why did you bring your laptop?" Wesley noticed the device peeking from Henry's bag.

Henry quickly zipped the bag shut. Evelyn shot her son a knowing look, alarm bells ringing in her mind.

She wouldn't confront him here.

Instead, she checked her phone discreetly for messages from Dominic.

Relief washed over her when she found none.

"I heard Zoe plans another surgery for Sophia," Wesley said, his expression troubled. "I can't tell if Zoe's being overly confident or if Dominic's being naive. She might not kill Sophia, but the results could be disastrous."

Evelyn's grip on her fork turned white-knuckled.

"Are you certain you don't want to tell Dominic you performed Sophia's first surgery?" Wesley asked quietly.
###Chapter 312

Wesley's question hung heavy in the air, leaving Evelyn speechless for a long moment.

"Have you ever truly loved someone, Wesley?" Evelyn finally asked, her voice barely above a whisper. "If you had, you wouldn't need to ask why I feel this way."

Wesley shook his head slowly.

"Love makes you possessive. I want to own every part of him, to be the only woman he sees. Most of all, I want a relationship with no barriers between us," Evelyn confessed. A bitter smile touched her lips as she added, "You've seen it yourself. He has Sophia, and he's willing to sacrifice everything for her treatment."

"Before I knew about Sophia's condition, I resented her deeply. But after learning the truth, that resentment faded. I could perform Sophia's second surgery if I wanted to, but I won't."

Wesley studied Evelyn with searching eyes.

"How do you think Dominic would react if he discovered I could cure Sophia?" Evelyn poured herself a generous glass of red wine. "Look how he treats Zoe now - so grateful he'd grant her every wish. Wesley, I refuse to be thanked for helping another woman."

A hollow laugh escaped her lips. "That kind of gratitude means nothing to me!"

Wesley gently removed the wine bottle from Evelyn's reach. "I understand now, Evelyn. If he can't give you perfect love, you'd rather have nothing at all."

"That's not all," Evelyn countered, her voice trembling. "Not only can't he return my love, but he's failed as a father to our children!"

Though she'd only had one glass, Evelyn's cheeks burned scarlet, her words laced with pain and anger.

"He rejected our children! So why is he letting Zoe keep her baby? Why isn't he forcing her to terminate the pregnancy? Tell me that!"

Wesley pushed a glass of juice toward Evelyn. "Please, don't upset yourself."

"Don't be sad, Mommy!" Lily tugged at Evelyn's sleeve. "Henry and I don't need that horrible father! We only need you."

Evelyn stroked her daughter's hair, forcing a smile. "I'm not sad, sweetheart. Just reminding myself of reality."

When Wesley had asked if she planned to tell Dominic the truth, Sophia's innocent eyes had flashed through Evelyn's mind, making her heart waver.

She'd spoken her thoughts aloud for Wesley's benefit, but also to reinforce her own resolve.

At worst, Zoe's surgery would simply fail to help Sophia - an acceptable outcome.

But if Dominic ever discovered Evelyn could have cured his sister, their lives would become entangled again!

With Sophia already complicating matters, now there was pregnant Zoe to contend with too.

How could she possibly reveal the truth?

Monday morning at Mooncrest Academy.

The prestigious kindergarten stood near the gates of Mooncrest Manor.

Evelyn always brought the children to school herself when possible.

On evenings she worked late, Henry would escort Lily home.

The children were engrossed in their lesson when a familiar figure appeared at the classroom door.

Lily spotted her first.

"Henry! It's Sophia!" she cried, dragging her brother toward the doorway.

Sophia stood there, her usually cheerful face clouded with worry.

"My surgery is tomorrow," she murmured anxiously. "I'm scared."

"Is Dr. Montgomery operating on you?" Lily asked.

Sophia nodded.

"Don't let her touch your brain, Sophia! You're not very smart to begin with - what if she makes you even dumber?" Lily declared. "You should hide like last time! Then they can't make you have surgery!"

Henry shot his sister a warning look. "Lily, stay out of it."

###Chapter 313
"Didn't we promise not to be mad at Sophia anymore?" Lily whispered, her small shoulders slumped in defeat.

Henry took his sister's tiny hand and led her back into the classroom.

Sophia's surgery was inevitable.

Her nervous visit wouldn't change anything.

She should've gone to Dominic Blackwood for comfort instead.

Dominic's phone buzzed at three in the afternoon. Mrs. Whitaker's frantic voice crackled through the line.

"Sophia's vanished again!" she cried. "The bodyguard and I have searched Mooncrest Manor for over an hour. She's nowhere to be found!"

"Why did you take her there?!" Dominic snapped, grabbing his keys as he stormed toward the door.

"She begged to see Henry all morning at school... Threw a tantrum when I refused. Wouldn't eat, wouldn't drink." Mrs. Whitaker's voice broke. "She's never been this difficult before. I had to bring her to him."

Ever since regaining self-awareness post-surgery, Sophia had become impossible to manage.

"So you took her to Henry Thorne?" Just hearing the name sent a sharp pain through Dominic's chest. "Did he hide her again?"

"No! When we arrived at Mooncrest Academy, Henry and Lily barely spoke to her before returning to class." Mrs. Whitaker sniffled. "After leaving, Sophia insisted on going to the neighborhood... Then she just disappeared!"

Dominic clenched his jaw. "Stop crying. I'm coming. She can't have gone far."

"She's just scared of the surgery," Mrs. Whitaker whispered. "My sweet girl..."

"I know."

Last night's bedtime had been a battle.

The procedure was necessary—for her health, her future. No more cruel whispers of "idiot" following her.

That evening, Evelyn Thorne's car approached Mooncrest Manor's gates. Police tape cordoned off the entrance, officers swarming the area as curious neighbors gathered.

Her stomach dropped.

Something was wrong.

Parking hastily, she sprinted toward home.

Please let the children be safe.

The house's calm interior contrasted sharply with the chaos outside. Her twins sat quietly in the living room.

"Good job staying inside," Evelyn praised, kissing each forehead.

"Nothing interesting out there anyway," Lily said calmly. "Sophia's hiding. They're searching for her."

Evelyn froze.

"Sophia's hiding here?!"

"Maybe. I told her to hide, but not in our neighborhood..." Lily pouted. "Now Dirtbag Dad might come looking. I don't want to see him."

Evelyn's cheeks flushed.

"Is she in our house again?"

Two small heads shook vigorously.

"We didn't help her this time. She disappeared on her own."

Evelyn exhaled sharply.

"Good. Stay inside. If anyone rings—"

The doorbell chimed, cutting her off.
###Chapter 314

Lily and Henry dashed to the front entrance, their small faces pressed against the digital screen of the door security system. The man's chiseled features were unmistakable even through the pixelated display.

"Mommy! It's him! The man who broke your heart!" Lily shrieked, her voice a mixture of terror and exhilaration as she sprinted toward Evelyn.

Evelyn untied her apron with deliberate slowness, then scooped up her trembling daughter. "Don't be frightened, darling. Go with your brother to your playroom," she murmured, exchanging a meaningful glance with Henry.

Henry's jaw clenched visibly as he led Lily away, their small footsteps echoing down the hallway.

After ensuring the children were safely behind closed doors, Evelyn marched through the sunlit living area and yanked open the heavy oak door.

Dominic Blackwood stood framed in the doorway, the dying embers of sunset casting long shadows across his sharp cheekbones.

"Sophia's disappeared. Her caretaker last saw her near your property," Dominic stated without preamble, his voice tight with controlled urgency. "I've searched every residence in this neighborhood except yours."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the doorframe. "So you're suggesting I might be harboring your precious sister?" Her laugh was brittle as winter frost.

Dominic's gaze never wavered. "I'm here to locate a missing person, not rehash our personal history."

"And if she's not here?" Evelyn challenged, swinging the door wide open.

Dominic took a threatening step forward, his cologne mixing with the evening air. "What exactly are you proposing?"

The sudden proximity made Evelyn stumble backward. "If Sophia isn't in my home, you swear never to darken my doorstep again!"

A muscle twitched in Dominic's jaw as he considered her ultimatum. Instead of responding, he raised his voice.

"Sophia! Come out now! Your brother is here!" His commanding tone filled the vaulted ceilings of the foyer.

When no response came, he tried again, softer this time. "Sophia, sweetheart, can you hear me? It's time to go home."

The endearment twisted like a knife in Evelyn's chest. The way he said "brother" with such tenderness—as if they shared blood rather than just a last name.

Yet there were no records of Sophia in the Blackwood family archives. What man would prioritize a non-blood relative over his own wife?

"Enough," Evelyn snapped. "She's not here. Search if you must." She gestured dramatically toward the interior.

Dominic moved with predatory grace through each room. The master bedroom. The study. The guest quarters.

When they reached the children's playroom, his steps faltered. Henry stood protectively in front of Lily, his small face contorted with hatred.

"Why do your children despise me so thoroughly, Evelyn?" Dominic asked quietly. "Have you poisoned them against me?"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp enough to cut glass. "Children have excellent instincts. You radiate the kind of energy that makes them recoil instinctively. You're hardly worth discussing at bedtime stories."

Dominic's hands curled into fists, but he said nothing—perhaps remembering the abortion he'd forced upon her years ago.

"Last time Sophia went missing, you were hysterical," Evelyn taunted. "What's different now? Expecting another Good Samaritan to deliver her to the emergency room?"

Dominic absorbed her venom with surprising patience. "Her cognitive abilities were severely impaired during that incident. She's made remarkable progress since then."

"How fascinating," Evelyn drawled. "Tell me, Dominic—if she becomes fully functional, will you love her more... or less?"

"That's enough." Dominic's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Your cruelty knows no bounds."

Evelyn tilted her chin. "To you, she'll always just be that simple-minded girl you're obsessed with!"

The words struck like a physical blow. Dominic's entire body went rigid, his expression turning thunderous. Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode away, his expensive shoes crushing fallen leaves on the pathway.

When his silhouette finally disappeared into the twilight, Evelyn sagged against the doorframe. He hadn't found Sophia. So why had he dredged up all those painful memories? The past should have stayed buried.

###Chapter 315 

Would dominic hold Evelyn's angry words against her forever?

After dinner, Evelyn called Michael's number, putting her phone on speaker as she started tidying up the kitchen.

"I'm coming home early today, Evelyn!" Michael announced in an unusually serious tone. "No bar tonight. It's work-related... Blackwood Group business. I'll explain everything tomorrow."

"Alright. Nothing too concerning, I hope?" Evelyn replied, wiping her hands on a dish towel. "This sudden responsibility is quite unexpected from you."

Michael chuckled through the phone. "Didn't want you thinking I was out fooling around. Don't bother saving dinner for me."

"Got it."

As the call ended, Evelyn glanced around the too-quiet house, her thoughts immediately drifting to Clara.

She'd refused to hire any help precisely because she wanted to recreate every chore her mother used to do.

Maybe then she could understand what Clara had been thinking during those quiet domestic moments.

The weight of guilt pressed heavier with each passing thought.

Clara had been her rock throughout the pregnancy.

After the twins were born, Clara dedicated every waking moment to helping raise them.

Never once had she lived for herself.

Evelyn had foolishly believed that was normal.

Only after losing Clara did she realize how she'd poured everything into work and the children, leaving nothing for herself.

"Mommy! Henry's being mean!" Lily's indignant cry shattered the silence as she burst from the bedroom.

Evelyn quickly wiped her damp cheeks and forced a smile. "What did he do this time?"

"He said my homework looks like chicken scratches! And threatened to tear my notebook if I don't rewrite it properly!" Lily sniffled, her lower lip trembling.

Taking her daughter's small hand, Evelyn led her back to the bedroom to inspect the offending homework.

No wonder Henry had been furious.

Lily's handwriting sprawled across the page like drunken spiders.

"Let's fix this together, sweetheart. First we'll erase this line..." Evelyn settled beside Lily at the small desk, guiding her tiny hand.

By the time homework was corrected and both children tucked in, the clock showed 10 PM.

Evelyn dragged her exhausted body toward the master bedroom.

Her mind felt simultaneously overloaded and empty.

She'd been busy all evening, yet accomplished nothing of substance.

Clara used to handle all these mundane tasks without complaint.

The debt she owed her mother could never be repaid - not in this lifetime.

Entering the walk-in closet, Evelyn reached for her pajamas.

The wardrobe door swung open to reveal a curled figure that nearly toppled out!

Reacting instinctively, Evelyn caught Sophia just before she hit the floor!

What was Dominic's sister doing here?

How long had she been hiding in the closet?

No time for questions.

Evelyn carefully lowered Sophia to the carpet, checking her condition before immediately calling Wesley.

When Lily and Henry woke the next morning, they found no breakfast prepared and their mother absent.

Though their preschool served meals, Henry particularly disliked the institutional food.

Evelyn always made sure to cook them a proper breakfast.

"Where's Mommy, Henry?" Lily rubbed sleep from her eyes. "Does this mean we don't have to go to school?"

Taking charge, Henry adjusted his glasses. "I'll take you to school if Mommy's not here."

"But where did she go?" Lily's voice quivered. "You don't think... she got tired of us and ran away, do you?"

Henry pressed a button on his smartwatch.

Evelyn's ringtone immediately echoed from the master bedroom.

"She left without her phone. Must have been an emergency." Henry marched to their mother's room, determined to check her recent calls.
###Chapter 316

At the Blackwood estate, Dominic hadn't slept a single minute all night.

Logically, Sophia's mental condition had shown significant improvement recently.

She'd even managed to memorize Dominic's entire phone number by heart.

There was absolutely no reason for her to spend the entire night hiding outside alone. The previous evening, Dominic had stationed several of his most trusted men around Mooncrest Manor.

Not a single update had come through, meaning Sophia remained missing.

Though the temperatures were milder than during the holiday season, wandering the streets all night could still give her a terrible cold.

Where on earth could Sophia be hiding?

Had some kind stranger taken her in?

Dominic paced restlessly.

Sophia had attempted to escape before her first scheduled surgery.

Since her cognitive abilities had improved, Dominic assumed her emotional resilience would have strengthened as well.

He'd painstakingly explained the necessity of the procedure to her countless times, believing she'd understood at least partially.

Who could have predicted she'd still resist so vehemently?

If he'd known this would be the outcome, perhaps he wouldn't have pushed so hard for the surgery.

But how could he bear to see her remain intellectually impaired her whole life?

What if he died before her?

Who would protect his vulnerable sister then?

The mere thought of Sophia being mistreated made Dominic's blood boil.

Such a scenario was completely unacceptable to him.

In Dominic's worldview, humanity divided into two distinct categories.

Ordinary people formed the first group, while he and Sophia comprised the second.

Dominic drove to Mooncrest Manor and combed through every possible hiding spot once more.

Later, he visited the neighborhood's security center to review all vehicle entry and exit records.

By two in the afternoon, Dominic's bloodshot eyes caught a familiar luxury car leaving the underground garage in the surveillance footage.

His fingers froze on the mouse, pausing the video abruptly.

"Isn't that Evelyn's vehicle?" he muttered, then checked the timestamp before adding, "Where was she going at half past ten at night?"

The security personnel nearby exchanged confused glances.

Weren't they supposed to be searching for Sophia Blackwood?

Why was he suddenly focused on Evelyn Thorne?

Dominic pulled out his phone and dialed Evelyn's number without hesitation.

When Evelyn's phone rang at Mooncrest Manor, both children immediately perked up their ears.

Since Evelyn wasn't home, they'd skipped school that day.

Henry had initially intended to take Lily to their classes.

As the older brother, he felt responsible for setting a good example.

But Lily had cleverly used Henry's own reluctance to attend school that day to change his mind.

Ultimately, Henry went to school briefly just to inform their teachers that Lily was ill and he needed to stay home to care for her.

The teachers accepted their excuse without question.

Now, the ringing phone sent waves of panic through the children.

"Isn't that Daddy's name on the screen?"

Lily couldn't read many words yet, but she recognized "Dominic Blackwood" perfectly.

"Why's he calling Mommy?" Henry wondered aloud before decisively rejecting the call.

"Don't you want to know why he called? I do! Let's answer if he calls again!" Lily protested with a pout.

"Don't be silly. He won't talk if he doesn't hear Mommy's voice!" Henry countered, then promptly blocked Dominic's number to prevent further disturbances.

Back at the security center, Dominic stared at his rejected call with utter bewilderment.

Even though they were divorced, was it necessary for Evelyn to refuse his calls so blatantly?

Just as he prepared to redial, his phone rang unexpectedly.

The caller ID showed Zoe Montgomery, but an unfamiliar voice came through.

"Mr. Blackwood? Dr. Montgomery asked me to update you," the woman said professionally. "She's currently in surgery with Sophia. The procedure should conclude within the hour."
###Chapter 317

Dominic shot up from his chair.

Sophia was at the hospital?!

Who arranged her admission?

Why wasn't he notified before the procedure?

"Who brought Sophia to St. Elizabeth? Which department is she in?" Dominic's grip tightened around his phone as he stormed out of the security office.

"I'm afraid I don't have all the details. We're at St. Elizabeth Medical Center," the woman replied before ending the call.

St. Elizabeth again!

Zoe had specifically planned to perform Sophia's surgery at Metropolitan General.

This meant Zoe knew Sophia had been taken to St. Elizabeth and rushed there immediately.

Who could have orchestrated this?

Evelyn?

But Sophia wasn't at Evelyn's residence when Dominic visited last night.

Though strong-willed, Sophia always behaved impeccably around Dominic.

She would never ignore his voice if she heard it.

Dominic's thoughts swirled chaotically.

The priority was Sophia's safety.

Two hours later, Dominic finally saw his sister in the recovery room at St. Elizabeth.

Her head was swathed in thick bandages, eyes closed in peaceful slumber.

"How is she?" Dominic demanded urgently.

Zoe offered a reassuring smile. "The procedure went perfectly. I maintained verbal contact throughout - she remained completely lucid."

While Zoe's confident expression eased Dominic's worries, something about the situation felt off.

"Why wasn't I informed immediately, Zoe?"

"My apologies! We had to urgently transfer equipment from Metropolitan General. By the time I realized, we were already prepping for surgery," Zoe explained with innocent sincerity.

Noticing the bloodstains on her scrubs, Dominic restrained further questioning.

"Thank you, Zoe," he said hoarsely.

"Of course. As your girlfriend, it's my duty," Zoe replied before excusing herself to change.

Approaching the private room, Dominic found momentary relief seeing Mrs. Whitaker and the security detail inside.

Stepping aside, he dialed Wesley Ashford's number.

He needed answers.

Why did Sophia always end up at St. Elizabeth during emergencies?

The pattern was too consistent to ignore.

"Mr. Blackwood? How may I assist you?" Wesley's calm voice answered.

"Dr. Ashford, isn't your father the chief administrator here?"

"May I ask why that's relevant?"

"I need to review today's security footage. I want to know who brought my sister here," Dominic said through clenched teeth.

"You'll need to visit our security office directly. I'm merely a physician here," Wesley responded evenly.

"Understood," Dominic snapped, terminating the call as he marched toward surveillance.

Several monitors in the security room displayed only static.

"Why are these screens offline?" Dominic demanded.

"Those cameras malfunctioned last night. Technicians are scheduled for repairs," a staff member explained.

"Which areas are affected?"

"Main entrance, ward access points, and the south parking structure..."

The timing and locations were too convenient. Genuine malfunction, or deliberate obstruction?

Evelyn's face flashed through Dominic's mind.

Where had she gone after leaving the underground garage at 10:30 p.m. yesterday?

Dominic dialed Evelyn's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..." The automated message deepened the ice in Dominic's piercing gaze.
###Chapter 318

Dominic dialed Evelyn's number again, only to hear the automated voicemail greeting.

His grip tightened around the phone.

How dare Evelyn ignore his call?

Or had she turned her phone off completely?

Scrolling through his contacts, Dominic found Michael Sterling's number and pressed call.

Since they lived together and worked at the same company, they were practically inseparable.

Michael frowned when his phone buzzed with Dominic's name.

Why was Blackwood calling him?

Since when were they on speaking terms?

His gaze shifted to Evelyn, curled up asleep on the oversized bed, and realization struck.

He answered just as Dominic's venomous voice snapped through the line.

"Put Evelyn on the phone!"

Michael blinked in shock.

What the hell was his problem?

"Evelyn's asleep. What do you want?"

Keeping his voice low, Michael watched Evelyn's peaceful sleeping face.

She'd arrived exhausted three hours ago and collapsed into bed without explanation.

He'd been about to leave when he noticed she hadn't even brought a change of clothes.

"Wake her up. Now."

Dominic's command dripped with barely restrained fury.

Sophia had disappeared from Mooncrest Manor last night, and Evelyn had driven off in the middle of the night.

Then Sophia miraculously turned up at St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

Conveniently, several critical surveillance cameras at the hospital had malfunctioned overnight.

Dominic refused to be played for a fool.

He knew Evelyn was involved.

Michael recognized the dangerous edge in Dominic's tone.

Leaning over, he gently shook Evelyn's shoulder. "Wake up, Ev. Your ex is demanding to speak with you."

Ex.

The word made Dominic's jaw clench.

He despised that label.

Yet Michael insisted on using it every damn time.

Evelyn didn't stir, her breathing deep and even.

She must have pulled an all-nighter to be this dead to the world.

"Evelyn Thorne! Dominic Blackwood is on the phone! If you don't wake up right now, that arrogant bastard will storm over here himself!" Michael threatened loudly near her ear.

Evelyn finally stirred.

Rubbing her bleary eyes, she looked around disoriented.

"You said Dominic... Where is he?"

"Here." Michael thrust the phone at her. "He sounds ready to rip someone's head off. Brace yourself."

Evelyn squinted against the light as she took the phone.

Gesturing to the water bottle on the nightstand, she croaked, "Water. Please."

Hearing Evelyn's raspy voice only confirmed Dominic's suspicions.

She'd definitely been with Sophia all night.

Otherwise why would she still be in bed at this hour?

Michael uncapped the water and handed it over. Evelyn gulped several swallows before pressing the phone to her ear.

"Hello?" Her voice was still thick with sleep.

###Chapter 319

"Finally decided to wake up?" Dominic's mocking voice came through the phone.

Evelyn flopped back onto the hotel bed, rubbing her throbbing temples. "You're the one who called and woke me. What do you want?"

"I saw you leaving Mooncrest Manor at 10:30 last night," Dominic said, his tone sharp. "Where exactly were you going that late?"

Evelyn kicked Michael's leg where he sat at the foot of the bed, shooting him a warning glare before answering.

"Michael got completely wasted last night. The bar called me to come settle his tab. By the time I got there, he was in no state to go home - I didn't want him waking the kids, so we got a room here." She paused, then added sarcastically, "Why? Interested in joining his bar hopping adventures? Should I have him invite you next time?"

Dominic's frown deepened.

This wasn't the answer he'd expected.

"Anything else?" Evelyn yawned dramatically. "Michael kept me up all night. I'm exhausted. If that's all, I'm hanging up."

Just before ending the call, she suddenly added, "Oh, by the way - did you find Sophia?"

That final question shattered Dominic's remaining suspicions.

Evelyn couldn't have been the one who took Sophia to the hospital.

She'd been at a bar last night!

And then stayed in a hotel with Michael until now!

"I found her," Dominic said curtly before hanging up.

The moment the call ended, Evelyn dropped her act. She tossed the phone back to Michael.

"Why did you lie?" Michael asked, bewildered. "And Sophia went missing again?!"

Evelyn pulled the covers up, closing her eyes with an indifferent expression. "Yes. She's surprisingly good at picking hiding spots. Had to choose my wardrobe of all places. If she'd hidden in yours or Mom's closet, she'd be dead by now."

When Evelyn found Sophia last night, the girl had been deathly pale with shallow breathing. Any later and it would have been too late.

Though mentally disabled, Sophia had incredible luck - both times she disappeared, she'd ended up at Evelyn's house.

"Holy shit! You didn't operate on her again, did you?" Michael pieced it together. "Letting Zoe Montgomery take credit again?"

Evelyn's eyes snapped open.

"Credit? More like a ticking time bomb. If she hadn't been near death when I found her, I would've handed her straight to Dominic. If I didn't treat her, he'd assume I did something to her."

"Admit it," Michael saw right through her. "You couldn't let Zoe operate on Sophia. You've felt guilty ever since calling her an idiot before. This was your chance to make amends."

Evelyn stayed silent.

Michael's intuition was annoyingly sharp.

"You don't want to get tangled with Dominic Blackwood again, so you're stuck doing good deeds in secret!"

Evelyn scowled. "Shut up and let me sleep. I'm exhausted!"

"Fine, sleep all you want. You'll need it before the next disaster hits when you wake up," Michael teased.

Evelyn refused to take the bait.

"Then get out! Do you have some weird sleeping fetish?"

"Hey! You didn't bring your phone or wallet. What about checking out later—"

"Go pay at reception now. I'm worried about the kids. Go check on them."

"Already called Henry. He said they skipped school today because they didn't feel like going."

Evelyn's expression darkened.

She took a deep breath before waving Michael off. "Then go watch them. They're probably hungry by now."

"Please, they know how to order takeout. Any progress on finding a bodyguard?"

Suddenly wide awake, Evelyn threw off the covers and tied her messy hair into a ponytail.

"Haven't decided yet. Worried about reliability, but also about the kids' safety. They're always running off."

Michael raised an eyebrow. "Want me to ask Nathan for recommendations?"

Evelyn looked at him in horror. "Do you think my children have death wishes? Why don't you just ask Dominic to be their bodyguard while you're at it?"
###Chapter 320

Michael's hand flew to his mouth the instant he realized his slip-up.

"You've been compromised!" Evelyn exhaled sharply, her brow furrowing.

"No chance! He hasn't been prying about us lately," Michael protested, his pale blue eyes rolling dramatically. "I'm certain!"

"He can't hold his liquor like I can. I get him wasted every time we drink. There's no way he could extract anything from me."

Evelyn didn't doubt his words.

Her concern was whether he might be withholding information or could eventually be compromised.

"If you fall for Nathan's pillow talk..."

A pained expression crossed Michael's face.

Changing topics abruptly, he asked, "Are you really planning to keep helping Sophia without compensation? Not charging Dominic Blackwood medical fees is a massive loss!"

Evelyn shook her head. "There won't be a next time. It's not that I won't assist her. Her condition is too severe - my abilities have limits. We can't predict her post-surgery state, but she won't be worse than before."

"Doesn't that mean Sophia will keep suffering if Dominic remains unaware and continues her current treatments?" Michael said regretfully. "Dominic might be scum, but Sophia... Despite her cognitive challenges, she's still sweet and endearing!"

Evelyn didn't respond.

Exhaustion was creeping in.

She longed to return home and sleep.

At St. Elizabeth Medical Center, Dominic stood vigil by Sophia's bedside, studying her pallid, gaunt face.

He prayed she'd show improvement upon waking.

Even better if she could recall events preceding last night's surgery.

He desperately needed to know what had transpired.

Zoe Montgomery entered quietly.

Dominic glanced up. "You should rest at home. I'll notify you when she wakes."

Zoe's pregnancy was visibly advanced.

Dominic felt conflicted about her unborn child, but remained grateful for Sophia's treatment.

His team still hadn't located Eric Montclair.

The former idol had seemingly vanished.

For now, Zoe remained essential for Sophia's care.

"You're the one who needs rest. You pulled an all-nighter when Sophia disappeared, didn't you?" Zoe approached, gently touching his shoulder. "Go home, Dominic. I'll monitor things here."

Dominic studied her.

Zoe possessed remarkable medical skills alongside her gentle nature. He found no fault in her.

Why couldn't he treat her better?

"I'll leave after Sophia wakes," he insisted.

Though exhausted, sleep would elude him regardless.

"Please go rest, Zoe."

Reluctantly, Zoe complied.

Sophia awoke approximately an hour later.

Her eyes held an unfamiliar, chilling clarity as they scanned the room.

Dominic froze.

He'd never witnessed such an expression from Sophia before!

Medically, her cognitive impairment had rendered her childlike - laughing when happy, crying when sad, devoid of complex emotions.

This transformation was startling.

The surgery's effects were more pronounced than anticipated.

"How do you feel, Sophia?" Dominic grasped her cold hand, searching her face eagerly.

Sophia studied him momentarily before blinking slowly. "Where's Evelyn? Wasn't she speaking to me? Where is she?"

Dominic's heart stuttered.

Drawing a shaky breath, he demanded, "When did she speak to you?!"

Evelyn had been with Michael at Oceanview Grand since last night!

"Just now!" Sophia replied casually.

Dominic stood thunderstruck.

###Chapter 321

The walls of the hospital room seemed to tilt dangerously as Dominic's vision swam. His knees nearly buckled beneath him.

Had Evelyn deceived him, or was Sophia hallucinating post-surgery?

With trembling fingers, Dominic pulled out his phone and dialed Zoe Montgomery. "Get back to the hospital. Now."

The urgency in his voice sent a chill down Zoe's spine.

"Dominic, breathe," she said, forcing calm into her tone. "Sophia just woke up. Recovery takes time—"

His grip on the phone tightened.

But Sophia hadn't exhibited these delusions after her first procedure.

Ending the call abruptly, he returned to her bedside.

"Don't overthink things, Sophia," he murmured, brushing a strand of hair from her forehead. "You'll strain yourself." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "I can see you improving already."

"A sharp pain... here," Sophia whispered, touching her temple.

"Dr. Montgomery's coming. She'll prescribe something for the pain."

Sophia's gaze dropped to her lap. "I don't want to see her."

Dominic's throat constricted.

"That's ungrateful," he said, voice hardening. "She saved your life. You will thank her."

"No!" Sophia's head snapped up, eyes blazing with rare clarity. "It was Evelyn. She stayed with me—asked me questions, kept me awake. Her voice was... kind. Different."

Dominic's pulse thundered in his ears.

"Evelyn was with another man last night," he said through gritted teeth. "Your mind's playing tricks."

He schooled his features into neutrality, though panic clawed at his ribs. The last thing Sophia needed was his anxiety.

Sophia recoiled as if struck.

A trick?

The memory felt visceral—Evelyn's steady voice, the way her cool fingers had brushed Sophia's wrist. The exact words: "Stay with me. Just a little longer."

How could something so vivid be imaginary?

When Zoe arrived thirty minutes later, her examination revealed nothing alarming.

"Vitals are stable," she told Dominic, then lowered her voice. "What exactly did she say?"

Dominic glanced at Sophia before steering Zoe onto the balcony.

"She claims you didn't operate on her," he said, the words tasting like ash. "Insists Evelyn was there the entire time."

Zoe's clipboard clattered to the ground.

Evelyn Thorne performing brain surgery? Preposterous.

The woman had no published research, no surgical trail. That delicate procedure required years of specialized training—

Zoe forced a laugh. "Post-op confusion is common. I absolutely spoke to her during the craniotomy—standard protocol to monitor cognitive function."

She studied Dominic's face as the tension in his jaw eased.

"Monitor her closely," he finally said.

If not Zoe... could it truly have been Evelyn? Yet Evelyn had sworn she wasn't at the hospital.

The contradiction gnawed at him.

"Her behavior's perfectly normal for this stage," Zoe soothed, patting his arm. "Go home. Rest."

Only after instructing Mrs. Whitaker for the tenth time did Dominic leave.

The moment his footsteps faded, Zoe whirled toward Sophia.

"How could you betray me like this?" she hissed, clutching the girl's shoulders. "After everything I've done for you? Evelyn Thorne was never here!"

###Chapter 322 

Zoe's act was flawless, but Sophia saw right through it.

Those piercing blue eyes could detect lies with terrifying accuracy.

Sophia recognized the calculated sweetness in Zoe's voice - it was all for Dominic's benefit, never genuine concern.

"Big Brother told me to thank you," Sophia spat, crossing her arms. "But I won't."

Zoe shot a meaningful glance at Mrs. Whitaker. "Would you give us some privacy? I need to speak with Sophia alone."

Mrs. Whitaker hesitated, but with Zoe being the Blackwoods' miracle worker now, she didn't dare refuse.

The moment the door clicked shut, Zoe's mask slipped. "Why this hostility, Sophia? Has someone poisoned you against me? Since returning from abroad, I've dedicated every waking hour to your treatment plans. Not even a simple 'thank you'?"

Sophia met her gaze squarely. "Because it wasn't you who operated on me."

The visions before each surgery were too vivid - Evelyn's steady hands, her calming voice.

If Zoe had truly performed the procedures, why would Evelyn's face haunt those memories?

Sophia's mind worked differently, but her instincts were razor-sharp. She trusted what she'd seen.

"Really?" Zoe's laugh was brittle. "You're still recovering, darling. Your perception isn't reliable."

She leaned in, voice dropping to a whisper. "Who would believe a patient over their doctor?"

This was Zoe's ace - Sophia's history of cognitive challenges.

Even now, fresh from surgery, her words could be dismissed as confusion.

And the real surgeon's silence? That was Zoe's golden ticket.

If the anonymous doctor wanted credit, they'd have come forward by now. Their silence was permission.

"You're lying!" Sophia's hands fisted in the sheets.

Zoe's smirk made her blood boil. The girl might not be book-smart, but her moral compass never wavered.

"Sweetheart, you don't know real evil," Zoe purred. "I've never harmed you. I only want to stand beside Dominic - with you. Why can't you accept that?"

"GET OUT!"

Mrs. Whitaker came running at Sophia's scream.

Zoe smoothly intercepted her. "A wonderful sign, actually. This emotional response shows remarkable cognitive improvement."

Mrs. Whitaker's worry melted into awe. "Doctor Montgomery, you're a miracle worker!"

"Just doing my job. Now, she needs rest." Zoe produced a prescription pad. "Mild sedatives with meals. Essential for recovery."

Meanwhile at Mooncrest Manor...

Evelyn returned to find her children wearing identical guilty expressions.

"Mommy! Your phone!" Lily thrust the device forward like a peace offering, eyes shining. "Someone called! Guess who?"

"Already blocked him," Henry announced proudly.

Evelyn checked her blocked list - Dominic Blackwood, solitary and glaring. Her finger hovered over the unblock option.

Michael sauntered over, tossing grapes in the air. "What's to think about? The man's got his new shiny doctor. I'd have burned that bridge months ago."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Says the man who sobbed through an entire Adele album post-breakup."

"Low blow!" Michael raised his hands. "Kids! Who wants ice cream? Let's give Mommy some space."

Alone, Evelyn exhaled sharply. Dominic would stay blocked.

After today's display, his relationship with Zoe would accelerate. Engagements rings probably already sized.

She pocketed her phone decisively.

No more reasons to contact Dominic Blackwood. Ever.

As she headed to her bedroom, unbeknownst to her, at the Blackwood estate...
###Chapter 323

Dominic was trapped in a nightmare.

He saw Evelyn's slender fingers swiping across her phone screen, blocking his number with deliberate finality.

Not only would he never lay eyes on her again, but every attempt to call would meet digital silence.

An impenetrable wall had risen between them, severing all connection!

Dominic's chest constricted with visceral agony, as if someone had ripped out his still-beating heart.

He jolted awake, sheets clinging to his sweat-drenched body.

A haunted mist clouded his usually sharp gaze, the depths of his eyes churning with unbearable anguish.

Fumbling for his phone with trembling hands, he stabbed at Evelyn's contact.

7:03 PM glowed on the display.

After sleeping through daylight hours, she'd surely be home and alert now!

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable." The robotic female voice sliced through the silence.

His fingers turned bone-white around the device.

The nightmare had manifested in waking reality.

Evelyn had actually blocked him!

No other explanation existed for the repeated failed connections.

Driven by desperate verification, Dominic threw off the tangled duvet.

He snatched up the landline receiver with violent urgency.

Each button press echoed like a gunshot in the silent bedroom.

Though unconfirmed, his gut twisted with foreboding.

The dial tone connected.

It rang!

The call went through!

Dominic's grip threatened to shatter the plastic handset.

Crimson fury flooded his vision.

The old Dominic would have either demolished the phone or stormed to Evelyn's residence.

But now? He swallowed the volcanic rage, waiting.

Evelyn's phone vibrated against her nightstand, one hand clutching her blanket.

She grabbed it blindly, voice thick with sleep. "Hello?"

"Evelyn Thorne!" Dominic's roar vibrated through the receiver. "Unblock my number this instant!"

Sleep evaporated.

Her stomach dropped—discovered so quickly?

Composing herself, she countered, "What difference would it make, Dominic? We should—"

"Unblock me!" The command sliced through her attempted reasoning.

Her eardrum pulsed from the decibel assault.

"Must you always—"

"Now, Evelyn!"

"No!" Flames licked up her throat. "I won't be ordered around like one of your subordinates!"

Her crystal-clear defiance struck Dominic mute.

In the sudden quiet, Evelyn became aware of her ragged breathing, her runaway heartbeat, the feverish heat spreading beneath her skin.

This wasn't how she wanted their last interaction to feel.

How... had they spiraled to this?

"So this is truly goodbye?" Dominic's voice emerged raw moments later.

The naked devastation in his tone stripped away all pretense.

The man who commanded boardrooms with unshakable composure now stood emotionally exposed.

Evelyn's vision blurred. "Zoe's carrying your child," she whispered around the lump in her throat. "Build that life with her."
###Chapter 324

Michael and the twins had their ears pressed against the master bedroom door, listening intently.

Evelyn's earlier outburst had drawn them like moths to a flame.

Suddenly, the door swung open without warning.

Michael nearly tumbled straight into Evelyn's arms.

Evelyn blinked at them in confusion. "What are you all doing out here?"

"Who were you yelling at, Mommy?" Lily asked, her wide innocent eyes brimming with curiosity. "Was it Daddy the Jerk?"

"Your mother only turns into a wildcat around him and her enemies," Michael teased. "Otherwise, she's perfectly civilized."

"Oh, so Daddy the Jerk is Mommy's enemy."

Lily's deduction skills were frighteningly accurate.

Evelyn felt a dull throb beginning behind her temples.

She stepped past them and headed downstairs.

"There's dinner waiting for you in the kitchen, Evelyn!" Michael called after her retreating figure.

"Thanks."

"I'll get the kids ready for bed. We'll talk after you eat," Michael added.

Evelyn paused with one hand on the banister, turning back with a frown. "What's there to discuss? Why not just tell me now?"

"Have you forgotten our conversation this afternoon?" Michael sighed in exasperation. "Go eat first. I'll explain everything later."

Evelyn racked her brain but came up blank.

The past few days had been utter chaos.

Her sleep schedule was completely wrecked. She felt drained, and her memory was failing her.

After forcing down a few bites of food, Evelyn trudged back upstairs.

Michael's eyebrows shot up when he saw her. "You're finished already?"

Evelyn leaned against the doorframe of the children's bedroom. "What did you want to talk about? Stop being so cryptic."

Henry pushed Michael toward the door. "I'll take care of Lily."

Michael nodded, then grabbed Evelyn's arm and pulled her back downstairs.

"I didn't want to disturb your rest," Michael said apologetically. "It's work-related. Nothing urgent, just some issues with our latest product line."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "What kind of issues?"

"Our suppliers pulled a fast one on us. Remember those premium lenses we ordered from Luxor? They shipped us mid-range quality instead."

"That's unacceptable! How did this get past QA?"

"Year-end rush, and our manager wasn't familiar enough with the specs," Michael explained, pulling up a video on his phone to show Evelyn.

The view count had already surpassed two million.

SkyMaster was the most influential drone reviewer in the industry.

The video title alone was explosive:

"The Most Shocking Exposé Ever: How Thornfield Industries, subsidiary of Apex Innovations, is scamming consumers!"

The video provided a detailed breakdown, listing both strengths and flaws.

SkyMaster had gone so far as to purchase a drone from Apex Innovations directly to compare with Thornfield's Tempest series.

The damning conclusion? Despite being under the same corporate umbrella, Evelyn Thorne's overseas products were superior in both quality and value!

###Chapter 325

The Tempest series, manufactured in Eldermere, had identical battery performance to its overseas counterparts.

Yet its subpar lens quality made professional-grade photography impossible!

Despite this glaring flaw, it was priced as a premium drone!

Thousands of scathing comments flooded the video's comment section.

(This is outrageous! Has Evelyn Thorne forgotten her roots in Eldermere? How dare she deceive her own people? Disgusting!)

(#BoycottThornfieldIndustries!)

(Should we tag Blackwood Group? Their CEO Dominic Blackwood is Thornfield Industries' biggest client!)

Evelyn sank onto the couch, lifting a glass of water to her lips.

"I've spoken to Luxor," Michael Sterling said. "They're willing to honor the refund clause in our contract. But they refuse to sell us their high-end lenses."

"Why?" Evelyn set the glass down with a frown. "Is it a pricing issue?"

Michael shook his head. "We're seen as a threat to domestic drone competitors. They've formed an alliance to block us."

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

"Do they really think we'll collapse without Luxor's lenses? Ridiculous!"

"Other local camera manufacturers won't work with us either."

Evelyn nodded. "Then we'll source internationally."

"The costs would skyrocket," Michael countered. "Most top-tier camera companies have exclusive partnerships already."

"I know," Evelyn said calmly. "Just like how Apex Innovations has an exclusive deal with Vanguard Holdings. Even though we own Thornfield Industries, Vanguard can't supply us under this brand name."

She lowered her head, deep in thought.

Michael hesitated before speaking again.

"Luxor gave me the contact for Aureate Tech's president. I reached out. They'll cooperate—if we share Cerebra System's core technology."

Evelyn scoffed. "Aureate Tech? Isn't their VP Vincent Holloway—my father's former right-hand man? The man who nearly killed me over the Cerebra project?"

"Ah. Old enemies, then."

"Exactly. Tell their president to keep dreaming."

"I already declined last night."

Suddenly, an idea struck Evelyn.

"Recall every Tempest unit. Full refunds."

Michael's brows shot up. "Are you serious? The lens isn't that bad. For casual users, it's perfectly functional."

Evelyn shook her head. "We own our mistakes. Money lost is nothing compared to reputation destroyed."

"Understood." Michael grinned. "Our top client is Dominic Blackwood. Should I handle that, or...?"

Evelyn's cheeks burned.

She'd just drawn a firm line with Dominic—even blocked his number.

And now this crisis forced her back to him.

How humiliating.

"You're going," she snapped, eyes flashing. "Did you miss our argument earlier?"

"Fine. I'll see him tomorrow." Michael nudged her toward the kitchen. "Eat something. We'll solve this. Worst case, we invest in Vanguard Holdings and have them establish a new subsidiary here."

Evelyn smirked. "My thoughts exactly."

"They underestimated you," Michael teased. "Thought you'd crumble. But if Dominic Blackwood doesn't scare you, who could?"

At Dominic's name, Evelyn's smile vanished. "We fought badly, Michael. Tread carefully tomorrow."
###Chapter 326

The morning light filtered through the hospital windows as Dominic Blackwood arrived at the intensive care unit.

After consuming the herbal broth prepared by Mrs. Whitaker the previous evening, Sophia Blackwood's thoughts had grown foggy.

Exhaustion overtook her, pulling her into a deep slumber.

When she awoke after a restless night, her eyes held no spark of life.

That changed the moment Dominic appeared.

"How are you feeling today, Sophia? Any headaches?" His familiar, soothing voice brought color back to her pale face.

"Why hasn't Evelyn come to see me, Dominic?" she asked, her voice trembling with disappointment.

Dominic's brow furrowed slightly, the warmth in his gaze fading. "She won't be visiting. You need to stop thinking about her or those children, Sophia."

Her distress deepened visibly.

"None of you believe me... Evelyn spoke to me. She asked me so many questions..."

Dominic's heart clenched at his sister's sickly appearance.

"It's not about belief. Maybe she did speak to you, but only in your dreams."

"Really?" Sophia stared at Dominic as if in a trance.

Could it all have been just a dream?

"I often dream of our childhood too," Dominic explained patiently. "But when I wake, I return to reality. No matter how vivid the memories feel, they're just dreams. None of it is real."

Sophia lowered her gaze, absorbing his words with visible difficulty.

Dominic left the hospital at precisely 10 a.m., heading straight to Blackwood Group headquarters.

With Mrs. Whitaker attending to Sophia, he had no concerns.

Though subdued today, Sophia's mood was far more conducive to recovery than yesterday's emotional turmoil.

Mrs. Whitaker had mentioned Zoe Montgomery prescribing sedatives.

Perhaps the medication was responsible for this change.

Speaking of Zoe...

When Evelyn had told him last night to build a life with Zoe, rage had kept him awake until dawn.

But after calming down, his perspective had shifted slightly.

As Dominic entered his office, Nathan Cross followed closely behind.

"Thornfield Industries is in trouble, sir. Have you seen the morning news?" Nathan inquired.

"Not interested," Dominic replied coldly.

Having learned about Dominic's argument with Evelyn from Michael Sterling, Nathan wasn't surprised by his boss's reaction.

"Thornfield issued a statement this morning recalling all Tempest Series drones," Nathan said carefully, watching Dominic's expression. "Michael called earlier, asking if we'd like to return our purchased inventory."

Dominic powered on his computer, raising an eyebrow indifferently. "Do you know why Michael contacted you instead?"

Nathan knew the reason but feigned ignorance.

"Evelyn blocked my number," Dominic said with a bitter laugh. "Since she can't reach me directly, she used Michael as intermediary."

Nathan was speechless.

He hadn't anticipated this development!

Arguments were one thing, but blocking numbers seemed unnecessarily childish!

"What would you like to do?" Nathan studied Dominic's cold smile, trying to decipher his thoughts. "Should we return everything and let them absorb the loss?"

Dominic's expression hardened.

"The financial hit won't hurt her. We're keeping everything. Let her stew over it."

Nathan was stunned.

His boss's thought processes were becoming increasingly difficult to follow.

Did he want Evelyn to suffer, or was he protecting her from financial loss?

Exiting the office, Nathan immediately called Michael Sterling.

"Well? What did Dominic Blackwood say?" Michael asked anxiously.

Nathan adjusted his glasses. "Tell Evelyn to unblock my boss's number immediately! He's furious about this."

Michael rubbed his temples. "And if she does, he won't return the products?"

"Exactly," Nathan confirmed.

Michael pushed open Evelyn's office door only to find it empty.

Evelyn had arrived at dawn to handle the growing crisis.

###Chapter 327

Michael had no clue where Evelyn was, but her phone lay abandoned on the desk.

He snatched it up and immediately checked the blocked contacts list.

What the hell?

Dominic's name wasn't there at all!

Michael hastily returned the phone to its original position, schooling his features into perfect neutrality.

The office door swung open just as Evelyn strode in.

"Any response from Blackwood Group?" she asked while grabbing the water glass from her desk and taking a long sip.

"They refuse the recall," Michael reported. "You're not seriously considering pushing for it, are you?"

Evelyn set down the glass, locking eyes with him. "You know me too well. But even if I insisted, they'd never comply. No point wasting energy on them."

Michael gave her an approving thumbs-up.

"Wire them seven point five million," Evelyn added abruptly.

Michael's jaw dropped.

"Never mind," Evelyn amended just as quickly, her voice steady. "He'd throw another tantrum over a refund. We'd just end up fighting again."

"Exactly!" Michael agreed enthusiastically.

"Get out. I need some alone time."

"Okay... Just don't go reading online news about the company or checking comments," Michael warned before exiting.

Since Thornfield Industries' scandal broke, rival drone companies had banded together, flooding the internet with paid trolls and fabricated articles smearing Evelyn and her company.

The web now overflowed with vicious posts about Evelyn Thorne and Thornfield Industries.

Alone, Evelyn opened her laptop.

"Thornfield Industries Apology," "Thornfield Bankruptcy," "Evelyn Thorne Fraud," "Deport Evelyn Thorne" - countless similar hashtags trended across social media.

To an outsider, it would appear Evelyn had committed some unspeakable crime.

Fewer than seven thousand Tempest Series drones had sold - five thousand to Dominic alone.

Only about two thousand reached actual consumers.

Was this circus really necessary?

[Know how Evelyn Thorne got rich? Overseas sugar daddy! Homewrecker money explains everything!]

[Just look at her face - total gold digger! Who does she think she's fooling?]

[Boycotting Thornfield forever!]

[Me too!]

Evelyn's eyes turned to ice as she scanned the fabricated rumors.

Reacting would mean her enemies won.

She closed the browser, steadied her breathing, and opened her email to focus on work.

That evening, the Blackwood family gathered at the ancestral manor.

Yet an arctic chill permeated the air.

All because of Dominic's glacial expression.

"Sophia's surgery went well, didn't it?" Eleanor ventured. "We really owe Zoe this time. Without her-"

"How should I thank her?" Dominic cut in sharply.

Eleanor swallowed her words at the dangerous glint in her son's eyes.

Finally, she suggested cautiously, "I know you're against marriage. Just an engagement then? Some recognition for Zoe's efforts."

"Fine."

That single syllable stunned the room.

No one was more thrilled than Zoe herself.

Dominic Blackwood had actually agreed to marry her!

Dear God - she was about to become Mrs. Blackwood!
###Chapter 328

Dominic left the Blackwood estate after dinner.

His destination was St. Elizabeth Medical Center to check on Sophia.

The remaining Blackwood relatives departed shortly after.

When Eleanor retreated to her chambers, Julian slipped into Zoe's room.

Zoe had been residing at the ancestral home since her pregnancy became public knowledge.

"Brilliant work, Dr. Montgomery!" Julian exclaimed, shutting the door behind him. "To manipulate someone as formidable as my uncle! Should I start addressing you as Aunt Zoe?"

A serene smile graced Zoe's lips. "Naturally. Once we're engaged, I'll be his fiancée. What difference does a title make?"

"Congratulations! Though..." Julian's expression darkened with concern. "How do we ensure my uncle never questions the child's paternity? Our entire inheritance plan hinges on this baby."

Zoe's composure shattered. "This child will never see daylight!"

Julian's face clouded over.

"The moment this child is born, your uncle will demand a DNA test," Zoe hissed. "When the results expose our deception, he'll discard me instantly! You'll be ruined too!"

Julian's lips trembled. "Isn't there any way to... manipulate the test results?"

"Impossible! Unless he lets me conduct the test myself! He'd never allow that - he's always been suspicious of me, searching for other specialists to treat Sophia..." Zoe's voice cracked with barely contained hysteria. "The moment he finds a replacement, I'm finished!"

Julian placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "But he hasn't found anyone yet, has he? You're truly remarkable, Dr. Montgomery! Both surgeries were flawless. No wonder uncle changed his mind about the engagement. If it were me, I'd marry you in a heartbeat."

Zoe snapped back to reality.

She violently shrugged off Julian's hand, her face twisting in disgust. "Get out! Don't ever enter my room uninvited again!"

"Fine... If you're determined to terminate the pregnancy, how do you plan to do it?" Julian's gaze lingered on Zoe's swollen abdomen with complicated emotions.

"You'll know when the time comes!"

Zoe was already arranging her chess pieces.

By morning, news of Dominic Blackwood's impending engagement to Zoe Montgomery had spread through all of Ravenswood.

Even the date was set - the engagement party would occur in precisely fourteen days.

The announcement instantly trended across social media platforms.

Michael Sterling scrolled through the headlines during breakfast.

"Think Dominic's using his engagement to divert attention from our scandal?" he quipped. "The online harassment has noticeably decreased today."

Evelyn Thorne meticulously peeled a hard-boiled egg.

Her expression remained impassive. "Do you honestly believe the president of Blackwood Group would concern himself with problems our company can resolve financially? He can announce his relationship whenever he pleases. Focus on our own affairs."

"Fair point. We're hemorrhaging money though!" Michael set down his phone and sipped his coffee. "We'll need to reinvest all the profits from Dominic's contract into refunds."

Evelyn took a deliberate bite of egg. "Our reputation outweighs financial losses."

Michael studied her intently. "You seem completely unaffected by Dominic's engagement news. Honestly fine with this? He was the love of your life!"

"That chapter is closed. Why revisit it?" Evelyn finished her meal and stood. "I'm flying to Stonebridge today to discuss our next collaboration with Vanguard Holdings."

"When did you book tickets? You never mentioned... Running away because you can't handle Dominic's engagement?" Michael teased.

Evelyn displayed her flight confirmation email. "Booked last night. Do you think I somehow predicted today's announcement?"

"Alright! How long will you be gone?" Michael walked her to the foyer.

"Undetermined. I'll return as soon as possible. The children need supervision."

"Take your time abroad if needed. I'll care for the twins."

Michael recognized how toxic the current environment had become for Evelyn.

Between social media trolls demanding she leave Eldermere and her ex-husband's very public engagement...

The mere thought was suffocating.

That evening, Lucas Grant invited Dominic for drinks. Dominic declined with a frown. "I'm visiting Sophia tonight."

###Chapter 329

 "Can't the security team and caretakers handle her? It's been ages since we've had a proper drink!"

Lucas declared, then leaned closer to Dominic, whispering, "Evelyn left the country today."

Dominic's expression darkened instantly.

An overwhelming urge to drown his sorrows seized him.

Lucas secured them a table at an exclusive rooftop lounge.

The two men stood against the railing, each clutching a bottle of premium whiskey, their gazes fixed on the glittering cityscape below as they drank in heavy silence.

The crisp spring air clung to their skin like a second layer of clothing.

After draining their first bottles, Lucas turned to Dominic. "Did you really agree to this engagement with Zoe just because of Sophia's treatment?"

"My mother always wanted this union. Evelyn told me to build a life with her. Sophia's condition was merely the final push."

Dominic tilted his head back, exposing the sharp lines of his throat.

His Adam's apple bobbed visibly before he rasped, "Evelyn wanted nothing more than to sever all ties between us. I'm simply honoring her wishes."

Surely Evelyn would be pleased now that he was bound to Zoe!

"Stop looking like you're attending a funeral. It's just an engagement, not a life sentence. Even marriage certificates can be shredded!" Lucas clapped Dominic's shoulder when he saw his friend's tortured expression. "Another round. We're not done yet."

A week later, Sophia appeared unexpectedly at Mooncrest Academy, standing outside Henry and Lily's classroom.

For the first time, her usual radiant smile was absent.

Previously, she'd always greeted them with unrestrained joy.

Henry and Lily emerged from the classroom.

"I came to see you one last time, Henry, Lily..." Sophia's voice trembled as tears welled in her eyes.

"One last time? Did Dominic... I mean, is Mr. Blackwood forbidding you from visiting us again?" Lily caught herself just in time.

Sophia shook her head violently, tears streaming down her cheeks.

"I'm dying. The doctors say... I don't have much time left."

The twins exchanged helpless glances, a wave of sorrow crashing over them.

Sophia produced a carefully wrapped package from her bag.

"I want you to have my most treasured possessions because you're my dearest friends."

She wiped her face clumsily before revealing a jewelry case and several leather-bound photo albums.

These represented her entire world's happiness.

Every item had been gifted by Dominic.

Lily's tears broke free first. "No! You can't die! Put these away! Henry and I won't accept them!"

Nearby, Mrs. Whitaker discreetly wiped her own eyes.

(Property of NovelDrama.Org)

Sophia had been losing consciousness nightly since the procedure.

By all logic, she should have been recovering strength during sleep.

Instead, she grew weaker each morning.

Today she'd thrown an unprecedented tantrum, demanding to see the twins.

Mrs. Whitaker had smuggled her out without Dominic's knowledge.

"Mommy's coming home today, Sophia! Let's go see her! She'll know how to help you!" Lily grabbed Sophia's hand with sudden determination.

Henry recognized the recklessness of this plan.

Evelyn might be furious, but he didn't intervene.

His chest ached with a familiar pain - the same he'd felt when they'd lost their grandmother.

###Chapter 330

In the master bedroom at Mooncrest Manor, Evelyn had collapsed into bed the moment she returned at dawn, exhausted from the long flight.

Lily rushed to her mother's side, clutching her hand with tiny fingers. "Mommy! Wake up! It's important!" she cried, her voice trembling with urgency.

Evelyn stirred, blinking against the sunlight filtering through the curtains. The sound of her daughter's distress pulled her from sleep.

"Sophia says she's dying, Mommy! You have to help her!" Lily pleaded, tears welling in her big, round eyes.

The words jolted Evelyn fully awake.

She sat up, her gaze landing on Sophia standing quietly beside Lily.

Evelyn inhaled sharply, ready to refuse—but what came out instead was, "Why do you think you're dying, Sophia?"

Mrs. Whitaker cut in before Sophia could answer. "She hasn't been the same since the surgery. No energy, always tired... It's like she's fading away."

"Has she been to the hospital?" Evelyn asked, rubbing her temple.

Mrs. Whitaker shook her head. "Dr. Montgomery said it's normal recovery fatigue. Just needs rest."

"But you don't believe that."

Mrs. Whitaker hesitated. "I trust the doctors, but... seeing her like this breaks my heart."

"Then take her to the hospital!" Evelyn exhaled sharply. "If you can bring her here, why not take her for a proper checkup?"

"I can't," Mrs. Whitaker admitted, wringing her hands. "Dr. Montgomery would be furious if I went behind her back."

"And you think Dominic won't be furious that you came to me?"

"Sophia wanted to see you. Please, Miss Thorne. If you take her, Mr. Blackwood won't blame anyone."

Evelyn clenched her jaw.

Mrs. Whitaker was using her as a shield—avoiding Dominic and Zoe's wrath by making Evelyn the one to intervene.

"Please," Mrs. Whitaker begged, bowing her head.

Lily tugged at Evelyn's sleeve. "Mommy, help her! She wasn't like this before. What if she really dies?"

"Lily, you—"

"I'm not being mean! She's sad and sick!" Lily's lower lip quivered, her eyes red.

Evelyn surrendered.

After dropping Lily and Henry off at school, she drove Sophia and Mrs. Whitaker to St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

"Did you bring any ID, Sophia?"

Sophia shook her head.

"Do you remember your ID number?"

"Sophia doesn't have any identification, Miss Thorne," Mrs. Whitaker answered quietly.

Evelyn froze.

That wasn't possible.

Every citizen in Eldermere had documentation—even orphans.

Why didn't Sophia?

She didn't press further. Mrs. Whitaker wouldn't tell her the truth anyway.

Then, from the backseat, Sophia murmured, "I think you were the one who did my surgery, Evelyn."

Evelyn caught Mrs. Whitaker's shocked expression in the rearview mirror.

"It wasn't me," Evelyn denied instantly. "I'm just taking you for one checkup, Sophia. If anything else happens, go to Dominic. Understand?"

Mrs. Whitaker picked up on Evelyn's sharp tone and quickly nodded. "Of course, Miss Thorne. I won't trouble you again."

"Good." Evelyn tightened her grip on the steering wheel.

Mrs. Whitaker lowered her eyes. "Thank you."

###Chapter 331

Dominic and Zoe's engagement was just a week away.

As Dominic's ex-wife, Evelyn had no intention of getting involved in his personal affairs.

Mrs. Whitaker brought Sophia home at three in the afternoon after her medical checkup.

Evelyn drove straight to the office.

During the week she was abroad, Thornfield Industries had processed refunds for nearly every customer who returned their products.

The scandal surrounding their product quality had led to the cancellation of all orders placed around the New Year.

The company wasn’t just suffering financial losses from refunds—it was also facing the terrifying reality of having no new orders.

For any business, this was a death sentence.

Without stable funding, Thornfield Industries wouldn’t last long before declaring bankruptcy.

The entire office was drowning in fear, everyone terrified of losing their jobs.

The moment Evelyn stepped into the building, several department heads rushed to her.

"What do we do now, Miss Thorne?"

"The workshop is shut down, and morale is at an all-time low. The employees are panicking!"

"This is all my fault," the head of quality control admitted, his voice thick with guilt. "I overlooked the issue. If I hadn’t, we wouldn’t be in this mess."

Evelyn studied them for a moment before speaking firmly. "Send everyone home if there’s no urgent work. Their salaries will be paid as usual. The quality team made a mistake, but it’s done. Just don’t let it happen again. If it does, resign."

"But what’s our next move?" the vice president pressed. "We’re the laughingstock of the entire industry!"

Evelyn took a slow sip of water.

A sharp knock interrupted them.

"Miss Thorne," her secretary announced, "Mr. Holloway from Aureate Tech is here to see you."

Evelyn had already warned Vincent to stay away.

Yet here he was, bold as ever.

He must be here to gloat.

"Let him in," she said, then turned to the executives. "For now, focus on stabilizing the team. We’ll reconvene later."

"Yes, Miss Thorne."

They filed out just as Vincent strode in, a smug grin on his face.

Evelyn moved from behind her desk to the couch, gesturing for him to sit.

"You’ve hit a dead end, Evelyn Thorne," Vincent drawled, glancing around her office. "Pity. You barely had six months to rebuild before it all crumbles again."

"Thank you for your concern, Uncle Vincent," Evelyn replied coolly. "But just like you’ll never get your hands on my father’s Cerebra System, your predictions won’t come true either."

His grin vanished instantly.

"Don’t push me to take drastic measures," he hissed. "Even if you survive this, we’ll still crush you. You won’t last in Eldermere!"

"We’ll see who crumbles first," Evelyn countered, unfazed.

"Do you even realize who you’re up against? Over eighty percent of domestic capital is against you! Are you really this stubborn?" He leaned forward, voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "If your father were alive, he wouldn’t be this reckless!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Do you know why you’ll always be a vice president? Because you’re nowhere near as smart as I am."

Vincent slammed his glass down, shattering it.

Then he stormed out.

At the same moment, Dominic’s phone rang.

"Mr. Blackwood, come home immediately!" Mrs. Whitaker’s voice trembled with panic. "Sophia’s test results—she’s overdosed on sleeping pills!"

Dominic’s expression darkened. "Who gave her sleeping pills?!"

Mrs. Whitaker clutched the white pill bottle Zoe had handed her. "I’ll explain when you get here," she whispered.

###Chapter 332

Dominic slammed the phone down with a thunderous expression, his knuckles white from gripping the device too tightly. Without another word, he stormed out of his office.

Sleeping pills weren’t something just anyone could get their hands on.

Where had these come from?

The moment the black Rolls-Royce pulled into the driveway, Mrs. Wilkins immediately ushered Sophia back to her room.

When Dominic strode into the living room, Mrs. Whitaker silently handed him the medical report.

"You took Sophia to the hospital?" Dominic’s voice was dangerously calm as he fixed his piercing gaze on her.

Mrs. Whitaker hesitated, her fingers twisting nervously in her apron. She couldn’t meet his eyes.

Evelyn had warned her not to mention her involvement unless Dominic pressed for answers.

"It was Miss Thorne," Mrs. Whitaker admitted under the weight of his stare. "Sophia insisted on visiting Miss Thorne’s children today—"

"Evelyn’s back?" Dominic cut in sharply.

"She returned this morning," Mrs. Whitaker murmured. "She didn’t want to get involved, but I begged her. Sophia kept saying she was dying. I was terrified."

"Why didn’t you call Zoe?"

Dominic’s composure cracked the moment Evelyn’s name was spoken.

"I’ve spoken to Doctor Montgomery about Sophia’s condition before," Mrs. Whitaker said helplessly. "She always dismissed it as normal post-surgery effects. I couldn’t just stand by and watch Sophia suffer."

Dominic fell silent.

He picked up the report, scanning the results with a deepening frown.

"What’s this?"

"I think it might be related to the sedatives Doctor Montgomery prescribed, but I’m not certain." Mrs. Whitaker handed him a small white pill bottle with trembling hands.

Dominic twisted the cap off and examined the contents.

White pills.

Zoe arrived an hour later.

The living room was thick with tension, the air so heavy it was hard to breathe.

The moment Zoe spotted the pill bottle on the coffee table, her face paled.

She forced an innocent expression. "Those are the sedatives I prescribed for Sophia. I instructed Mrs. Whitaker to give her one pill with each meal for three days. Her emotions were too volatile—it wasn’t good for her recovery."

Mrs. Whitaker’s face twisted in disbelief.

"Doctor Montgomery, you never said it was only for three days! That’s why I’ve been giving them to her every day!"

Zoe’s brows knitted together. "I distinctly remember telling you three days. If her condition didn’t improve, you could extend it to a week—but never longer. Did you forget?"

Mrs. Whitaker’s mouth fell open. She was being framed.

"Doctor Montgomery, you told me these were sedatives! If I’d known they were sleeping pills, I would never have given them to her daily!"

"Sedatives are sleeping pills," Zoe said coolly. "But it’s not too late. Her body will flush them out as long as she stops taking them now."

Mrs. Whitaker clenched her fists. If not for Evelyn’s intervention, she would’ve unknowingly poisoned Sophia.

"Mrs. Whitaker is getting older, Dominic. Mistakes happen," Zoe said smoothly, playing the magnanimous savior.

Dominic’s gaze turned glacial. "Then why did you give her an entire bottle if it was only meant for three days?"

Zoe blinked, then recovered quickly. "I must’ve been distracted. And I trusted Mrs. Whitaker to follow instructions."

"From now on, I approve every prescription Sophia takes—even vitamins," Dominic bit out. "If this happens again, there will be consequences."

With that, he turned on his heel and headed straight for Sophia’s room.
###Chapter 333

Sophia was organizing her desk with Mrs. Wilkins' assistance.

Dominic's throat tightened as guilt washed over him in waves.

Every time Sophia had mentioned feeling lightheaded recently, he'd simply advised her to rest more.

He never imagined sleeping pills could be the source of her discomfort.

If Evelyn hadn't insisted on taking her to St. Elizabeth Medical Center for examination, there's no telling how long she might have continued taking those pills.

Dominic felt profoundly grateful to Evelyn, yet struggled to articulate his appreciation.

At dawn the next morning, Mrs. Wilkins appeared at Evelyn's doorstep unexpectedly.

Evelyn blinked in surprise before quickly ushering the housekeeper inside.

"Forgive the unannounced visit, dear," Mrs. Wilkins said, presenting two glass jars. "Master Dominic requested I bring these homemade preserves for you."

"Thank you! But why so early?" Evelyn inquired, pouring her guest a glass of chilled lemon water.

"Truth be told," Mrs. Wilkins confessed, lowering her voice, "Master Dominic sent me to express his gratitude. That hospital visit yesterday... heaven knows what might have happened otherwise."

Evelyn's welcoming smile faltered.

"You can't imagine how terrifying it was," Mrs. Wilkins continued, shuddering slightly. "Zoe swears she told Mrs. Whitaker to administer the pills for only three days, but Mrs. Whitaker insists she received no such instruction. The poor woman wept in my arms last night - after twenty years caring for Sophia, she'd never harm a hair on that girl's head."

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "Twenty years? Has Sophia been with the Blackwoods that long?"

"Indeed! Though Mrs. Whitaker only ever called her 'that poor little lamb' - never shared more details."

Evelyn remembered Dominic's stony silence whenever she'd inquired about Sophia's past.

"Never pegged Zoe for such deceit," Mrs. Wilkins sighed heavily. "And now with their engagement imminent... I fear she's not what she seems."

"If Dominic isn't concerned, neither should you be," Evelyn offered weakly.

"Forgive me, dear. This isn't proper conversation." Mrs. Wilkins rose abruptly. "When those preserves run low, just ring me. I'll send more straightaway."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, escorting her to the door.

She pretended indifference about the engagement news.

Yet she'd spent the night tossing restlessly.

Eventually, she'd grabbed her phone, fingers typing forbidden searches.

Zoe's social media appeared instantly.

Recent posts showcased designer wedding gowns, obscenely large diamond rings... and bump photos.

Each image dripped with saccharine captions about her perfect life.

Beyond Zoe's profile, countless reposted images surfaced.

Candids of Zoe clinging to Dominic's arm during shopping trips.

Friends flaunting engraved engagement invitations.

Evelyn zoomed in.

Dominic Blackwood & Zoe Montgomery.

Both signatures authentic.

A hollow ache spread through Evelyn's chest.

No invitation bore her name.

###Chapter 334

Five days later, Dominic arrived at Blackwood Group headquarters precisely at 10 AM as usual.

"Sir, your engagement is tomorrow," Nathan reminded him as he held open the office door. "Shouldn't you take the day off?"

Dominic strode past without breaking step. "Not necessary."

Nathan followed closely behind, clearing his throat. "Sir, Michael just informed me that Vanguard Holdings has agreed to establish a new facility in Eldermere to supply high-end lenses exclusively for Apex Innovations."

Dominic paused mid-stride. "Isn't Vanguard Holdings currently partnered with Aureate Tech?"

"Exactly." Nathan adjusted his tie. "This demonstrates the exceptional rapport between Miss Thorne and Vanguard's CEO. They wouldn't relocate operations just for anyone."

Dominic's fingers twitched against his briefcase. "What else did you uncover?"

"The current CEO of Vanguard happens to be the nephew of Professor Sebastian Whitmore's cousin." Nathan lowered his voice. "Apex Innovations' success wasn't accidental - it was orchestrated."

Dominic's jaw tightened.

Why would Sebastian Whitmore's relative specifically know Evelyn?

Was this arranged or mere coincidence?

"Thornfield Industries' current challenges aren't product-related but concern branding and market penetration," Nathan continued. "I suggested hiring a marketing firm, but Michael said Evelyn refused. She insists quality speaks for itself—"

Dominic's icy glare cut him off. "Why are you reporting Thornfield's affairs to me? Who signs your paycheck?"

Nathan froze.

Weren't you listening intently two seconds ago?

Dominic turned to his computer, voice flat. "Evelyn and I are finished. Cease these unnecessary reports about her or her company."

"Yes, sir."

Nathan retreated, nearly colliding with Lucas in the hallway.

"The boss claims it's officially over with Evelyn," Nathan muttered. "We both know he's lying to himself."

Lucas chuckled. "Since when did you grow a spine? Careful, Michael's rebellious streak is rubbing off on you."

"I'm serious! He's getting engaged tomorrow but looks ready to murder someone. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion."

"His choice, his consequences." Lucas shrugged. "We're just spectators."

Nathan narrowed his eyes. "You're enjoying this, aren't you?"

"Don't be absurd." Lucas's grin widened. "Though I am tempted to forge his signature and send Evelyn an invitation..."

"That would derail the entire engagement." Nathan's eyes widened. "Isn't that exactly why he's avoiding inviting her? Because seeing her might change his mind?"

Lucas coughed abruptly and clapped Nathan's shoulder.

"What? You know I'm right—"

"Nathan Cross! My office. Now!" Dominic's thunderous voice echoed down the hall.

Nathan's blood ran cold.

At noon, Evelyn's phone buzzed with a call from Mooncrest Academy.

"Miss Thorne, Lily isn't feeling well. We've sent her home to rest. Please check on her when possible."

Evelyn's fork clattered onto her plate.

She'd dropped off both children perfectly healthy that morning.

What could have happened?

Her fingers trembled as she dialed Henry's smartwatch.

The line connected instantly.

"Henry, the school called about Lily being sick. What's going on?"

Through the receiver came the distinct sound of wind rushing past.

They weren't home.

###Chapter 335

"Lily's feeling dizzy, Mommy. She just needs to rest," Henry said, his voice calm and reassuring. "There's nothing to worry about."

"I see... That's good to hear. Take good care of your sister."

"I will."

After ending the call, Evelyn didn't return to her office.

Instead, she turned her car toward Mooncrest Manor.

She had already guessed the children weren't actually at home.

If she'd told Henry she was coming, they would have rushed back immediately.

This way, arriving unannounced, she could catch them if they were lying.

Evelyn suspected the children were using illness as an excuse for some secret plan.

Lily was usually more innocent, but she followed Henry's lead too easily.

Given Henry's history of mischief, Evelyn felt a growing unease in her chest.

She pulled into the driveway of Mooncrest Manor and hurried to the front door.

Her fingers flew over the security keypad before pushing the door open.

Almost immediately, Henry appeared in the hallway.

When their eyes met, the air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

Evelyn suddenly felt guilty.

How could she doubt her own children?

They were home after all.

Maybe Lily really wasn't feeling well.

"Henry, I was worried so I came to check on you both. How's your sister?" Evelyn asked softly, moving toward the children's bedroom.

"She's sleeping," Henry explained. "Don't worry, Mommy."

Evelyn nodded, then watched her daughter's peaceful sleeping form, gently touching her forehead.

No fever.

"Go back to work, Mommy!" Henry said, looking up at her with innocent eyes.

"I'll stay home with you today."

Evelyn realized she'd been neglecting the children lately with her busy schedule.

"Uncle Michael said there were important things at the company," Henry said pointedly. "You should go to work, Mommy!"

Evelyn's cheeks flushed with embarrassment.

"Don't worry. I'll handle everything quickly."

"Okay!" Henry walked her to the door.

The moment Evelyn left, Henry shut the door firmly behind her.

Instantly, Lily jumped out of bed.

"That was close, Henry!" Lily exhaled dramatically. "Thank goodness Uncle Michael warned us! Mommy would've been furious if she came home to an empty house!"

Henry's expression remained unreadable.

He grabbed his backpack, put on his cap, and said, "Stay here. I'm going alone."

"No way! I'm coming with you! I'll be scared staying by myself!"

Lily quickly grabbed her own bag and chased after her brother.

The siblings left their neighborhood and hailed a taxi.

Once inside, they gave the driver directions to an exclusive luxury hotel.

The very hotel where Dominic Blackwood's engagement party would be held tomorrow.

"Henry, you said you had a big surprise for Dirtbag Dad... What kind of surprise? How big is it?" Lily's bright eyes sparkled with curiosity.

"I can't tell you."

Lily pouted. "Why not?"

"It's not for kids."
###Chapter 336

"You're just a kid too!" Lily exclaimed, her curiosity bubbling over like a shaken soda can.

"My eyes needed bleach after seeing that. You really want to ruin your perfect vision?" Henry shot back, wiping imaginary dirt from his eyes.

Lily shook her head vigorously, her pigtails swinging.

The temptation was strong, but her brother's warning made her reconsider. Some mysteries were better left unsolved.

"Mom's hiring bodyguards for us," Lily announced, kicking her feet against the chair. "We'll be like zoo animals with handlers."

Henry smirked. "Then you'll be the perfect distraction while I slip away."

Lily pouted, then blurted, "If Scumbag Dom really marries that Montgomery woman, we should pretend he doesn't exist! Who needs a dad anyway?"

Henry studied his sister's innocent face, then said with conviction, "That wedding won't happen."

"Why not?"

"She's toxic."

"So is Daddy! They'd be perfect for each other!"

Henry opened his mouth, then closed it. His four-year-old sister had just out-logicked him.

Maybe he should let Dominic Blackwood keep playing the fool until Henry came of age. Then he'd release the hotel footage of Zoe Montgomery and Julian Whitmore's scandalous night.

Now that would be nuclear revenge.

But patience wasn't Henry's strong suit.

He wanted payback now.

There would be plenty of time for more creative punishments later.

At Thornfield Industries' executive meeting, Evelyn unveiled her bold plan after days of deliberation.

The room went dead silent.

Department heads exchanged wide-eyed glances, jaws practically hitting the polished mahogany table.

Michael Sterling, Evelyn's most devoted supporter, broke the tension with thunderous applause. He'd cheer if she set their headquarters on fire.

The other executives mechanically joined in, their frozen smiles masking internal panic. The boss wanted to burn money? As long as she signed their paychecks...

"Does the plan seem... unwise?" Evelyn asked, sipping her espresso.

The dam burst.

"Miss Thorne, we know you're loaded, but this is financial suicide! Six million minimum! Our order books are empty and you want to give away premium drones?"

"Replacing lenses on two thousand Tempest drones? The cost alone—"

"I think it's genius," Michael interjected. "And they're not free! A dime per unit."

"A dime? That's not even pocket change!"

"Do the math—two thousand dimes makes two hundred bucks."

Crickets.

Evelyn set down her cup with a decisive clink. "I know the concerns. But right now, we're not chasing profit—we're rebuilding trust. No one will buy our drones, no matter how advanced, with our current reputation."

The VP sighed. "If you're willing to invest that much in damage control... let's try it."

The marketing head stood. "I'll draft the announcement immediately."

Within hours, Thornfield Industries' website published a bombshell:

"All previous Tempest Series drone owners can upgrade to our new high-end lens model for just ten cents."

The internet exploded. A $3000 drone for a dime? The tech world lost its collective mind.
###Chapter 337

No matter how harsh the previous customers had been, who could resist the allure of essentially receiving a brand-new, top-tier drone for free?

The entrance of Thornfield Industries was soon swarmed with returning clients.

Evelyn didn’t leave the office until well past nine that night.

She slid into her car and sped toward home.

The twins were likely asleep by now.

Once everything settled, she wanted nothing more than to stay home and soak up every moment with them.

Her phone buzzed abruptly.

Glancing at the screen, she tapped her Bluetooth earpiece and answered.

"Evelyn! Have you seen the absolute nonsense on social media? I'm fuming!" Sophie's voice crackled with fury through the line. "You practically handed out free drones to those ungrateful people, and yet they're still dragging your name through the mud!"

Evelyn had anticipated this.

Vincent had warned her—unless she surrendered their core technology, he’d ensure she never operated smoothly in Eldermere again.

She was up against over eighty percent of the domestic market’s financial power.

No matter what she did, they’d tear her down and smear her reputation.

All she could do now was endure.

She believed in her product. It would speak for itself.

"I haven’t looked. And neither should you," Evelyn replied calmly.

"How can I ignore it when it’s right there? I’m already clapping back at those trolls for you!" Sophie huffed. "I’ve rallied all my friends to support Thornfield Industries. You’ve got this!"

"Thank you. I just… don’t know what comes next."

"If you need help, I’m here!" Sophie declared, then abruptly shifted topics. "Oh, and I’m definitely not going to Dominic Blackwood’s engagement party tomorrow."

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh.

"You don’t have to do that, Sophie."

"Oh, I absolutely do! That slimy bastard and that scheming witch, Zoe Montgomery? No way am I subjecting myself to their disgusting lovefest."

Sophie’s tone was so vehement that Evelyn didn’t argue further.

Meanwhile, at the Blackwood estate, Dominic stepped out of the shower, restless despite the late hour.

He poured himself a glass of wine and settled at the bar, scrolling through the latest headlines about Thornfield Industries.

Their latest business strategy seemed reckless at first glance—but it was undeniably brilliant.

The best way to combat bad press wasn’t to hide, but to face it head-on with sincerity.

Yet, the internet remained merciless.

Some claimed Evelyn Thorne had orchestrated the whole thing as a publicity stunt.

Others accused her of plotting to monopolize the market—once she crushed her competitors, she’d slash quality and hike prices, recouping every penny lost now.

The most absurd rumor? That all of Evelyn’s funding came from foreign investors. Buying from Thornfield Industries was allegedly lining foreign pockets.

Within hours, the hashtag #BoycottThornfieldIndustries had exploded past a hundred million views.

If this continued, Evelyn might never recover.

Dominic’s grip tightened around his wineglass.

She was being torn apart by the domestic market, and he could do nothing but watch.

She wouldn’t accept his help.

He didn’t realize how dark his expression had become.

At seven the next morning, breaking news erupted across social media, crashing servers under the sheer volume of traffic.

Dominic was jolted awake by his ringing phone.

He answered with a scowl.

Whatever he heard on the other end had him throwing off the covers and lunging out of bed.
###Chapter 338

Just minutes ago, Eric Montclair, the elusive pop legend Dominic Blackwood had been desperately searching for, finally resurfaced on social media!

As the undisputed king of pop three years ago, his tragic on-stage accident had marked the darkest moment of his career.

Since that fateful day, he vanished completely from public view.

Most assumed he had perished.

Yet his devoted fans kept vigil, flooding his social media with daily comments and likes, praying for his return.

Miraculously, their prayers were answered!

N?vel(D)ra/ma.Org exclusive ? material.

At precisely 6:55 a.m., Eric Montclair posted an update on his official account.

[My dearest friends. Three long years have passed. How have you been? I've been well, though rather lonely. Last year I purchased a Tempest Series drone. Each day I sent it soaring to distant places, and each evening it returned with breathtaking footage. Through its lens, I experienced vibrant cityscapes alive with light. This drone became more than machinery - it became my companion. Now my dear friend faces unjust criticism due to minor flaws. I cannot remain silent. Please give it the same chance to grow that you once gave me during my career.]

Accompanying the heartfelt message was an exhilarating video compilation shot entirely with a Tempest Series drone.

The emotional clip concluded with Eric gently wiping dust from the drone's surface.

After three years of complete silence, no one anticipated the pop icon's dramatic return would be tied to a product endorsement!

His fanbase erupted in frenzy!

The sheer volume of traffic nearly crashed the social media platform.

Service was restored after thirty chaotic minutes.

Comments on Eric's post multiplied at staggering speed.

(OMG I KNEW HE WAS ALIVE! ERIC PROMISED HE'D NEVER LEAVE US!!!)

(MONCLAIRIANS ASSEMBLE! OUR KING HAS RETURNED!)

(Just ordered 15 Tempest drones from Thornfield Industries! Anything for Eric!)

Dominic studied the post skeptically, suspecting foul play.

The entire message read like a carefully crafted advertisement for Thornfield Industries.

With Michael Sterling's world-class hacking skills...

Compromising a celebrity account would be child's play.

Their Tempest drone line was currently embroiled in controversy and desperately needed positive publicity.

Eric's unexpected endorsement was nothing short of miraculous.

Yet Dominic couldn't dismiss the unmistakable appearance of Eric's distinctive hands in the video.

After cross-referencing with archival photos, Dominic confirmed their authenticity.

Why would someone who disappeared for three years suddenly reemerge to promote a product?

Did Thornfield pay him an astronomical sum?

Dominic had exhausted every resource trying to locate Eric Montclair.

How had Evelyn Thorne made contact?

Was there some undisclosed connection between them?

Dominic needed to reach Eric immediately - his medical team might hold the key to Sophia's recovery.

While Sophia Blackwood had shown slight improvement after her latest surgery, full recovery remained distant.

Perhaps Eric's physicians could accelerate her healing process.

The frustrating obstacle? The video's nondescript woodland backdrop offered no clues to his whereabouts.

His only option now was confronting Evelyn directly.

At precisely 9:00 a.m., the doorbell chimed at Mooncrest Manor.

Michael Sterling shuffled to the entrance, running fingers through his tousled blond hair. After glancing at the security monitor, he turned the knob.

###Chapter 339

"Michael! Why aren't you and Miss Thorne answering your phones?" The vice president of Thornfield Industries paced anxiously outside Mooncrest Manor, his eyes scanning Michael Sterling from head to toe. "This is an emergency! You need to wake Miss Thorne immediately!"

Michael ran a hand through his tousled hair, embarrassment coloring his features as he stepped aside to let the executive in. "Unless the company's burning down, I don't see what could be so urgent."

"You two didn't hire a celebrity spokesperson last night, did you?" The vice president followed Michael inside, his voice rising with excitement. "Eric Montclair just endorsed our Tempest series! Do you realize who he is?"

All traces of sleep vanished from Michael's face as confusion took over. "You're not making any sense."

"Good lord! Eric Montclair - the pop icon who disappeared three years ago - just posted about our drones on social media! Our customer service lines are jammed, and new orders are coming in faster than we can process them!" The vice president's cheeks flushed with exhilaration. "I've never seen anything like this!"

When repeated calls to Evelyn and Michael went unanswered, he'd driven straight to the manor.

Michael's instincts prickled with unease. Something wasn't right.

He rushed to the master suite, knocking sharply before entering - only to find the room empty. "Evelyn's not here," he muttered. "Her phone's really off?"

The vice president shook his head vigorously. "I called both of you before ringing the bell. Straight to voicemail."

Michael disappeared into his room, emerging minutes later dressed in fresh clothes. "I looked into Montclair. He vanished from public life years ago. Yet suddenly he defends our company, and all the online trolls magically disappear? His fanbase is terrifyingly powerful."

"I know who he is. Evelyn used to be a huge fan," Michael said, his mind clearing. "But why he'd help us? Only Evelyn would know."

"Didn't she mention where she was going?" The vice president wrung his hands. "My phone's been exploding all morning. I've had to keep it on airplane mode just to function!"

Michael arched an eyebrow. "Is it really that bad?"

Sweat beaded on the executive's forehead. "Worse! Everyone thinks we orchestrated Montclair's comeback! They're demanding to know how much we paid him! My teenage daughter won't stop pestering me for his autograph!"

Michael could only stare in stunned silence.

Meanwhile, at the Oceanview Grand Hotel, preparations for Dominic Blackwood and Zoe Montgomery's engagement party were in full swing.

Zoe stood resplendent in her custom designer gown, her makeup flawless, her smile perfectly practiced. She'd been waiting since dawn for Dominic's arrival.

As nine o'clock came and went without word, her composure began to crack.

"Let's go to the venue first," Eleanor Blackwood suggested, patting Zoe's arm. "I tried calling Dominic earlier, but his phone was off. I'm sure he'll call back as soon as he sees our messages."

Zoe maintained her gracious smile, but misery coiled in her chest. They'd agreed Dominic would pick her up from the family estate. This was their engagement day - how could his phone be off? The painful truth was Dominic didn't care about her at all.

During the tense car ride, Zoe scrolled through her phone and froze at Eric Montclair's latest post. Her brow furrowed. Why would he help Evelyn Thorne? Without his intervention, Thornfield Industries would have collapsed soon enough.

A terrible realization struck her.

Was Dominic's absence connected to Evelyn?

With trembling fingers, Zoe dialed Evelyn's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable."

Zoe's carefully constructed composure shattered. Dominic's phone was off. Evelyn's phone was off. Were they together right now?
###Chapter 340

The doors of the Rolls-Royce clicked shut with finality.

Evelyn sat trapped inside, regret washing over her in waves.

She must have been half-asleep when she entered the vehicle this morning.

By the time realization struck, the locks had already engaged.

What fresh hell was this?

Had she just been kidnapped?

"Dominic, what do you want?" Evelyn demanded, glaring at the man beside her with narrowed eyes.

Wasn't this supposed to be his engagement day?

Where did he find time to ambush her like this?

"Do you know Eric Montclair, Evelyn?" Dominic's piercing gaze locked onto hers, his voice dangerously calm. "Don't even think about lying to me."

After their brief phone call earlier, Evelyn's phone had died completely.

She had no idea what storm was brewing online.

The mention of Eric sent warning bells clanging in her mind.

"I don't. Why?"

She maintained eye contact with Dominic's familiar-yet-alien expression, forcing her breathing to stay even.

"Why would he help you if you were strangers?" Dominic's voice turned razor sharp. "I saw his photo on your phone before. You've never cared about celebrities, yet you saved his picture. Now you claim not to know him? Do you take me for a fool?"

His accusatory tone ignited her temper. "What business is it of yours who I know?" she snapped.

Her defiance seemed to calm him momentarily.

Was this her way of admitting the connection?

If Evelyn truly knew Eric Montclair, it would solve everything.

"Help me contact him," Dominic's voice dropped to a rough whisper, almost pleading. "I'll owe you."

Evelyn couldn't suppress a bitter laugh.

"I told you - I don't know Eric Montclair! If you want him, go find him yourself!"

"Evelyn!"

"Yelling won't make me know him! Shouldn't you be getting engaged to Zoe Montgomery today? You can hunt down Eric anytime - why choose your engagement day? Your fiancée will be devastated if you don't show!" Evelyn fired back.

Her words drew a humorless chuckle from Dominic.

His Adam's apple bobbed before he said, "Help me reach Eric, and I'll go through with the engagement."

Evelyn's lips curled in derision. "Your engagement means nothing to me! Are you seriously trying to bargain with that? Do you think I still have feelings for you?"

Each word struck Dominic like a physical blow.

His instincts screamed that Evelyn knew Eric.

Why else would the reclusive star emerge to defend Thornfield Industries?

Yet she refused to help him.

If their positions were reversed, he'd move heaven and earth for her.

They might be divorced, but they'd shared something real once.

How could she be so cold?

She was utterly heartless.

Swallowing his pain, Dominic pulled out his phone and dialed Zoe.

On the other end, Zoe's despair lifted slightly when Dominic's name flashed on her screen.

"Where are you?" Her voice trembled. "I'm at the hotel with Eleanor and the others. We couldn't reach you earlier. The guests arrived, so we started without you."

"I can't go through with this, Zoe," Dominic said, his voice carefully controlled. "I'm with Evelyn now. I realize... I still love her."

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

Had he lost his mind?

This had to be insanity.

Otherwise, how could he do this? Say these things?

He was humiliating everyone involved!

Zoe's anguished sob echoed through the car speakers.

After waiting all morning, this was her reward?

Evelyn Thorne was nothing but a homewrecker!

Stealing her fiancé on their engagement day!

How would she explain this to hundreds of guests?

The shame would follow her forever.

People would laugh at her for years!

"Zoe, what's wrong?" Eleanor's frantic voice came through as Zoe's weeping grew uncontrollable. Just then, Gregory approached after ending another call.

###Chapter 341

"Dominic said to cancel the engagement. He's not coming," Gregory announced, quickly steadying his mother as she swayed.

Eleanor Blackwood stood frozen in shock.

"What happened? Is everything alright?" Gregory shook his head. "I don't know. He hung up abruptly. Something must have occurred! I'll have the driver take you home while I handle the guests."

The entire event had turned into a humiliating disaster!

Yet no one dared voice their thoughts aloud.

All eyes were fixed on Zoe Montgomery's tear-streaked face.

Never in her life had she experienced such public disgrace! She couldn't bear another second in that room. Gathering her gown, she fled the banquet hall in tears.

This wasn't over. Evelyn Thorne would pay for this!

At Mooncrest Academy, young Henry Thorne watched the engagement venue's live feed when Zoe suddenly stormed out!

His small forehead creased in confusion.

If Dominic Blackwood hadn't arrived yet, did that mean he wasn't coming?

Why else would Zoe Montgomery leave?

Was the engagement called off?

Henry's chest tightened as he steadied his breathing.

He despised Dominic, but couldn't deny their biological connection.

He'd claimed he didn't want a scoundrel for a father.

But if his father proved decent, how could he keep rejecting him?

At noon, the luncheon proceeded mechanically in the banquet hall.

Guests ate quickly before making hasty exits.

Henry never got to play his prepared video.

"Lily," he said suddenly.

"What is it, Henry?"

"Scoundrel Dad isn't getting engaged."

"What? Why not?" Lily asked, confused as she joined her brother.

"The scoundrel didn't show," Henry stated bluntly.

"Is he insulting all womankind?" Lily demanded sternly.

Henry had no answers for his sister's question.

Meanwhile, in the black Rolls-Royce, Dominic plugged Evelyn's phone into the car charger.

Her emotions had gradually cooled.

He wouldn't release her until her anger matched his calm.

Dominic remained determined to find proof of Evelyn's connection to Eric Montclair.

She had no choice but to comply.

When Evelyn's phone powered on, Dominic scrolled through her call history.

"Why so many initials in your contacts?" he demanded.

"Old classmates from abroad."

Her answer made his frown deepen.

If Evelyn spoke truth, Eric Montclair's name wouldn't appear.

"I'm asking one last time, Evelyn. Do you know Eric Montclair?" Dominic gripped her phone, his hawk-like gaze piercing.

"Ask a thousand times - the answer won't change," Evelyn replied without flinching. "At least not before today."

Dominic returned her phone.

Evelyn took it, then taunted, "Shouldn't you be wooing Doctor Montgomery? What if she refuses to treat precious Sophia anymore?"

"Does my suffering amuse you?" Dominic's expression darkened dangerously.

He unlocked the doors, but Evelyn remained seated.

Dominic's brows furrowed at her unexpected stillness.

"I'm not moving until you take me home," Evelyn declared.

Trapped with him all morning, hunger sapped her strength to leave.

Dominic accelerated toward Mooncrest Manor.

Before exiting, Evelyn gripped the door handle and hissed through clenched teeth, "You're despicable, Dominic Blackwood!"

"Despicable?" A vein pulsed at his temple. "Who meets your standards then? Michael? Or darling Wesley?"

"Anyone would be better than you!" Evelyn spat coldly, pushing the door open.

Dominic yanked her back inside.

Before she could resist, his lips crashed onto hers in a dominating, punishing kiss!
###Chapter 342

The kiss seemed to last forever.

Dominic didn't let Evelyn go until they heard sharp rapping on the car window.

Michael was peering into the vehicle with confusion written across his face.

Evelyn went pale with shock.

She reached for the door handle, but Dominic grabbed her wrist roughly. "The windows are tinted," he rasped. "He can't see anything."

Relief flooded through her.

That kiss had sent her emotions into complete turmoil.

Her cheeks burned crimson while her hair lay in wild disarray. Dominic had torn off her jacket and tossed it carelessly aside!

She snatched the garment from the floor.

Dominic offered her a water bottle.

"I don't want anything from you!" she hissed, glaring daggers at him.

Just remembering what he'd done made her blood boil with fury.

She'd rather die of dehydration than accept his water.

Dominic ignored her venomous stare.

All his pent-up anger had melted away during their passionate exchange.

Had all his recent misery simply been withdrawal from the taste of her lips?

"Didn't you enjoy that, Evelyn?"

Dominic took a slow sip of water, then wiped his mouth with deliberate elegance.

"It's been a while for you, hasn't it? If you're feeling... frustrated, I'd be happy to help you out. Free of charge."

"Go to hell, Dominic Blackwood!"

The cruel words stabbed through her heart. She practically leaped from the car.

She slammed the door with enough force to shake the vehicle, then delivered a vicious kick to its side.

"Holy shit! Evelyn!" Michael exclaimed. "What the hell were you doing in Dominic Blackwood's car? Were you two fighting in there? Why kick his car when you could've kicked his face?"

"Do you think I didn't want to? There wasn't enough room in there for proper kicking!"

"Jesus... I nearly called the police when you vanished all morning! What were you doing with him anyway? Wasn't today supposed to be his engagement?" Michael dogged her steps as she stormed toward the house.

Evelyn marched straight through the front door and bolted for the bathroom.

Her face felt like it was on fire!

She needed to wash away his touch, scrub his scent from her skin!

"Stop asking questions! Can't you see I'm furious? Give me some damn space!"

After splashing cold water on her face in the downstairs bathroom, she fled upstairs.

"Fine, let's not talk about that bastard! Let's discuss Eric Montclair instead! Why did he publicly defend our company? Do you know him? If not, why did you buy all those paintings of him before?"

Michael continued his relentless interrogation.

Thornfield Industries was in complete disarray.

Yet despite the chaos, everyone seemed oddly cheerful.

Michael practically vibrated with excitement.

The crisis that had kept him up all night had miraculously resolved itself overnight!

Evelyn checked her phone for updates. "Exactly how did Eric help us?"

"He posted this viral video endorsing our Tempest Series drones. His fans not only shut down all the online trolls, but our new orders are skyrocketing... Isn't that insane?" Michael couldn't contain his glee.

Evelyn's emotions tangled into knots.

While Eric's actions had saved her company, they'd also exposed him.

She never wanted him to make such a sacrifice.

But now, she could only accept his generous gesture with gratitude.

"Evelyn," Michael suddenly demanded, his expression turning serious. "What exactly were you doing in Dominic Blackwood's car earlier? And why are your lips all swollen? You look like you just got lip injections!"

Evelyn wished she had duct tape to silence him permanently.

Meanwhile, at the Blackwood estate, Eleanor had spent the entire afternoon comforting Zoe after their disastrous return from the hotel.

Though heartbroken, Zoe refused to become a public spectacle, maintaining perfect composure throughout the ordeal.
###Chapter 343

Forget the engagement.

Zoe Montgomery had long prepared for this moment when Dominic would end things and send her away from the Blackwood estate.

Even if he couldn't love her, she knew he'd compensate her handsomely.

The financial settlement would soften the blow considerably.

When the sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up to the grand entrance, Eleanor Blackwood turned to Zoe. "Dominic's home! I'll make him explain himself immediately!"

Zoe remained seated on the velvet sofa, her posture rigid.

Her heart lay in shattered pieces.

How could Dominic confess his lingering feelings for Evelyn Thorne on their engagement day?

Not only did he not love Zoe, he'd shown her utter disrespect.

All this despite her being Sophia's physician, having performed two critical surgeries.

Without that professional connection, she doubted he'd even acknowledge her existence.

Dominic stepped out of the vehicle and strode into the marble foyer.

"Mother," he greeted Eleanor with a curt nod.

"Are you alright, darling?" Eleanor grasped her son's arm, scanning him with maternal concern.

"I'm fine," Dominic replied tersely, guiding his mother inside.

His piercing gaze then fell upon Zoe's stony expression.

"I'll leave you two to talk," Eleanor announced. "Remember, Dominic, we owe Zoe answers. Proper explanations are due."

Dominic gave a tight nod.

Soon, the expansive living room held only Dominic and Zoe in tense silence.

"I apologize, Zoe," Dominic stated bluntly, standing near the mahogany coffee table. "I can't continue this charade."

"I understand," Zoe responded flatly.

"I'll compensate you generously for treating Sophia's condition. If you don't accept..."

Dominic's tone left no room for negotiation.

He didn't need to finish the sentence - Zoe grasped his meaning perfectly.

"I accept. The amount is at your discretion," Zoe forced a brittle smile. "This is my fault really. I overreached. Clearly I'm not Blackwood material. The money will suffice."

"Don't diminish yourself, Zoe. You'll find someone worthy. That person simply isn't me."

"Evidently," Zoe swallowed hard and stood abruptly. "I'll pack my things immediately."

"Wait." Dominic's eyes flickered to her pronounced baby bump. "Given your condition, you should remain here temporarily. We'll decide arrangements after the birth."

Zoe glanced down at her swollen abdomen, then offered a sardonic smile. "How generous."

Without another word, she turned and fled to her suite.

Eleanor reentered moments later, disapproval etched across her aristocratic features.

"How could you treat Zoe so callously? What sudden revelation prompted this change of heart?"

Dominic guided his mother to the sofa. "I'll secure a superior specialist for Sophia. You needn't concern yourself further."

"You've found someone more qualified than Zoe?"

Dominic's jaw tightened. "I will."

"Very well... I appreciate your dedication to Sophia all these years. Since you've no affection for Zoe, I won't force the matter. However, the physicians confirm her pregnancy progresses perfectly. We must keep this child," Eleanor insisted.

A shadow crossed Dominic's face.

Were it not for Zoe's delicate health making termination inadvisable, he'd never have consented to this pregnancy.

Beyond that crucial factor, his lack of love for Zoe extended to their unborn child.

This child's existence was destined for tragedy.

The shrill ring of Dominic's phone shattered the heavy silence.

He answered abruptly.

"Sir, we've located Eric Montclair!" The urgent voice crackled through the receiver.

Dominic's eyes flashed with sudden intensity. He bolted upright and stormed toward the exit without another word.

###Chapter 344

The phone in Mooncrest Manor rang the instant Evelyn stepped out of the shower, droplets still glistening on her skin.

She snatched it up without hesitation.

"Wesley?" Her voice carried the freshness of someone just awakened.

"Where have you been? Your phone's been off all morning!" The concern in Wesley's tone was palpable.

Evelyn winced, twisting a damp strand of hair between her fingers. "Battery died. Just plugged it in." She paused, then added knowingly, "This is about Eric Montclair, isn't it?"

A relieved sigh traveled through the line. "Exactly. He's worried you're angry with him."

"Angry?" Evelyn laughed softly, leaning against the marble countertop. "Just concerned I'm causing him trouble. I'll call him myself later."

"Good." Wesley's voice relaxed. "I nearly drove to your place when I couldn't reach you. Michael said you weren't home when I called... Where were you anyway?"

The question caught Evelyn off guard, her fingers freezing mid-air.

"Morning run," she blurted after a beat too long, forcing nonchalance into her voice.

"Ah... Good for you. But listen," Wesley's tone turned serious, "whatever's happening with Thornfield Industries, don't let it consume you. Your health comes first, always."

"I know! Thanks, Wes. Lunch is on me next time."

"That's what you always say!" His chuckle warmed the line. "My treat this time, whenever you're free."

"Deal!"

Hanging up, Evelyn selected fresh clothes from her walk-in closet, her mind already racing ahead.

Downstairs, Sophie practically launched herself at Evelyn before she'd fully descended.

"Evelyn Thorne! You won't believe the drama today!" Sophie's eyes sparkled with barely contained excitement. "If I'd known Dominic would ditch his own engagement party, I'd have gone with Adrian! Rumor has it Zoe Montgomery stormed out in tears!"

The mental image flashed before Evelyn's eyes, but she bit back the smile threatening to surface.

Zoe must loathe her now.

"Lunch is on the table," Michael called, gesturing to the takeout containers. "Stop by the office when you can. I'm heading out."

Evelyn nodded absently.

The moment the door closed, Sophie launched into a dramatic retelling of the engagement debacle.

"What kind of man stands up his own fiancée? Zoe's nowhere near as stunning as you, and let's be honest - she's downright nasty!" Sophie produced her phone, scrolling through photos Adrian had sent. "Look at this chaos!"

"Let me eat first, Soph," Evelyn sighed, unwrapping her meal. "I'm starving."

"Did you skip breakfast?" Sophie finally put her phone down. "Speaking of... what's your deal with Eric Montclair? How come you get all the gorgeous men while I'm stuck with—"

Evelyn nearly choked on her food.

"If you're so bored, do me a favor!"

"Name it!" Sophie perked up instantly.

"I need a bodyguard for Lily and Henry. Someone reliable to drive them around." Evelyn pushed her empty container away. "I've shortlisted candidates but can't decide. Help me interview them."

"Absolutely! Send me the details."

"A security company recommended them. Their office is downtown."

Evelyn forwarded a contact, then added, "I'm heading to Thornfield after this. Call me once you've decided."

"Will do!"

Later, as Evelyn navigated toward Thornfield Industries, she pulled up the encrypted section of her phone at a red light.

Eric answered on the first ring.

"Dr. Thorne."

"Eric, I appreciate what you did," Evelyn began carefully, "but your drone footage might have compromised your location."

"The woods are miles from my actual place," Eric countered confidently. "No way they'd find me."

Evelyn's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "If they analyze the drone's maximum range from those woods, they'll narrow it down. Dominic Blackwood's been hunting for you, remember?"

###Chapter 345

"It'll be fine. I won't mention you even if he tracks me down. Don't worry!" Eric reassured.

"Alright. Focus on your rehab. I'll be waiting for your return."

"I'll give it everything I've got!"

That evening, an unexpected visitor arrived at Eric's secluded mountain retreat.

He never imagined Dominic Blackwood would find him this quickly.

Dominic wasn't alone—Sophia stood quietly beside him.

"Hello, Eric. Apologies for the intrusion," Dominic said with polite restraint. "I've been searching for you for a long time. If not for the video you posted this morning, it might have taken even longer."

Eric's expression remained unreadable.

"How can I assist you, Mr. Blackwood?" he replied with equal courtesy.

Dominic glanced at Sophia, then gestured toward the garden. "There's a cat over there, Sophia. Why don’t you go take a look?"

Sophia wandered off with the bodyguard in tow.

Once she was out of earshot, Dominic turned back to Eric, his gaze intense.

"She’s my sister. She’s had a cognitive disability since birth."

Eric stiffened in surprise.

"My sister is kind-hearted, pure in ways most people can’t fathom," Dominic continued, his voice rough with emotion. "If you knew what she’s endured, you’d understand why I’m here."

He handed Eric a stack of photographs.

The first image showed a frail girl lying in a hospital bed.

Her body was skeletal, marred with bruises—horrific evidence of cruelty.

Eric couldn’t bear to look further and set the photos aside.

"Do you know how she got those injuries?" Dominic asked, retrieving the photos. "Our father did this to her. He was ashamed of her condition, so he beat her. Hard to believe, isn’t it? Especially when you saw how brightly she smiled at you earlier."

Eric’s jaw tightened.

"Mr. Blackwood, are you asking if my doctor can help your sister?"

"Yes. I’ll sacrifice anything if it means improving her life."

Eric exhaled. "After my accident, my family contacted Professor Sebastian Whitmore. He would’ve operated on me himself if he hadn’t passed away unexpectedly."

Dominic waited, brows raised.

"After his death, his assistant, Wesley Ashford, arranged for another surgeon."

A pause. Then, against his better judgment, Eric relented.

"You must know Evelyn Thorne. She performed my surgery but insisted on anonymity."

Dominic went utterly still.

Evelyn Thorne.

How could it be her?

She’d studied medicine but never pursued it professionally.

There was no way she could have operated on Eric Montclair!

"Miss Thorne told me she followed Professor Whitmore’s treatment plan," Eric added. "She even asked me to pay the medical fees to his family. She doesn’t want to be involved further. I sympathize with your sister, Mr. Blackwood, but I hope you’ll respect her wishes."

Dominic’s laugh was bitter. "Do you know who Evelyn Thorne is to me?"

Eric shook his head.

"My ex-wife," Dominic said, the words like a blade twisting in his chest.

Evelyn had lied to him.

She claimed she didn’t know Eric Montclair. Was this what she meant?

###Chapter 346 
Has Evelyn ever spoken the truth? Was she being cautious or was she treating him as the enemy?

If she was being cautious of him, why? What was she afraid of?

If she treated him as the enemy—that made even less sense! He had never intentionally harmed her, so why this hostility?

Dominic's forehead remained furrowed the entire drive home. Upon arrival, Mrs. Wilkins immediately took Sophia.

His phone rang. Without hesitation, he turned the car around and sped off.

At the Midnight Lounge, Lucas spotted Dominic entering. He quickly pulled him toward their usual booth.

"Dom! Where the hell have you been all day?" Lucas poured him a generous glass of whiskey.

"I went to see Eric Montclair." He accepted the glass and took a long sip. "You'll never guess who performed his surgery."

The group leaned in, waiting for the revelation, but Dominic clenched his jaw instead.

"Have I wronged Evelyn somehow?" He massaged his temples before downing the drink. "She demanded the divorce. Begged her to stay—wouldn't listen. Afterward, she rebuilt Thornfield Industries; I moved on. Every time she's in trouble, I'm there. Yet she keeps pushing me away. Told me to be with Zoe, so I did... And still she looks at me like I'm the villain. Why?"

Dominic's slurred words betrayed his intoxication.

Zoe was his current partner, yet Evelyn occupied his thoughts. Even now, drowning in liquor because of her.

"Dom, you've gone above and beyond for Evelyn! Her arrogance comes from your indulgence! I've said it before—the kinder you are, the more she disrespects you! Only by cutting her off will she appreciate you!"

"Fifteen million last year alone! Did she even thank you? Bet she didn't!"

"Fifteen mil could buy you a yacht with models fawning over you! She's not worth this torment!" The chorus of voices grew louder, each adding their own colorful insults.

By eleven, Dominic stumbled out reeking of alcohol. His driver helped him into the backseat.

Fumbling with his phone, he pulled up a contact. One burning question for the family physician.

When the line connected, his voice came out rough: "Could an untrained med student perform complex brain surgery? Not just any procedure—a complete success."

Silence answered him.

Dominic pressed his fingers against his throbbing temples. "I'm talking about Sebastian Whitmore and his protégés. His student... is Evelyn. No medical records exist, yet she operated on Eric Montclair! How did Wesley Ashford allow this?"

On the other end, Zoe's grip tightened around her phone.

A wrong number. He'd meant to call the doctor but reached her instead.

Evelyn operated on Eric?

No wonder Thornfield Industries received his support.

But how? Unless... was she Sebastian's prized pupil?

"Dominic, you dialed wrong." Her voice emerged strained, as if suppressing fury.

Hearing Zoe's voice, Dominic sobered instantly.

He checked the screen. Seeing her name, he ended the call immediately.

A drunken mistake with catastrophic consequences. Had she heard everything?

###Chapter 347

Dominic's mind swirled with fragmented memories, each thought piercing like shards of glass. The pounding in his skull made coherent thinking impossible.

Enough!

Whatever he'd said didn't matter anymore. Evelyn could hear every word if she wanted.

Evelyn felt like a sledgehammer had smashed into her skull. Her consciousness stretched thin, threatening to tear apart.

Though she hated admitting Evelyn's medical skills surpassed hers, the truth was undeniable.

Evelyn was Professor Sebastian's prized protégé! The anonymous surgeon who'd operated on Sophia twice was none other than her. She was the only woman who wanted nothing from Dominic. Others wouldn't be so selfless.

Everything Evelyn had received from Dominic was because of Evelyn's own merits. If Evelyn ever revealed the truth, she'd lose everything in an instant.

Her dominance evaporated. She needed to regain control—fast.

The next morning after breakfast, Evelyn accompanied Eleanor through the moonlit garden.

"Aunt Eleanor, Dominic explained why he broke our engagement during his call yesterday," Evelyn murmured.

Eleanor's face twisted with guilt.

"Do you know where he was yesterday morning?" Evelyn gave a bitter smile. "With Evelyn."

"Oh dear!" Eleanor's brows knitted together.

"Dominic said he still loves Evelyn. That's why he couldn't marry me." Evelyn's eyes glistened. "I've thought about it all night. I don't blame him. I forced this relationship. I'm content carrying his child, and I only want his happiness."

Eleanor hadn't expected such generosity from Evelyn.

"Aunt Eleanor, could you arrange for Evelyn to come? If I ask, she'll refuse." Evelyn lowered her lashes. "I just want to talk. If she treats Dominic well, I'll disappear."

Eleanor couldn't deny such a request.

An hour later, Evelyn arrived at Blackwood Manor against her will. She'd resisted, but Eleanor's authority as Dominic's mother and her seniority left no room for refusal.

Parking outside the grand estate, Evelyn entered the courtyard.

The figure beneath the willow tree could only be Evelyn. Spotting her arrival, Evelyn immediately approached.

"Evelyn, we need to talk!" Evelyn blocked her path. "I asked Aunt Eleanor to invite you."

Evelyn turned to leave, but Evelyn grabbed her wrist with surprising strength.

"Evelyn! You stole my fiancé, yet you can't face me?" Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Pathetic, isn't it? Even when Dominic held me at night, he whispered your name. But fate smiled on me—I carry his healthy child, unlike your... defective son."

Evelyn's fists clenched until her knuckles whitened. "What did you call my son?"

"Defective. He attends Willowbrook Academy, doesn't he? If not defective, what would you call him? Even if Dominic acknowledges him, he'll never inherit Blackwood Group. That right belongs to my child!" Evelyn stroked her belly with deliberate provocation.

Rage burned through Evelyn's veins.

Her last shred of reason screamed at her to leave. But Evelyn tightened her grip, trapping her.

"Let go!" Evelyn wrenched free with sudden force.

"Ah!" Evelyn stumbled backward, her spine connecting sharply with the stone bench behind her.
###Chapter 348

Evelyn stood frozen, her mind reeling from the shocking scene before her.

She had merely shaken Zoe's hand off her arm. How could this have happened?

Zoe lay crumpled on the marble floor, clutching her abdomen with anguished cries. "My baby... please, save my baby!"

The commotion drew the attention of the household staff and Eleanor Blackwood, who came rushing from the parlor.

"Zoe! What in heaven's name happened?" Eleanor's face twisted in fury as she turned to Evelyn. "Did you do this?"

The accusation hung heavy in the air. The floor was perfectly smooth - no possible reason for Zoe to have fallen unless pushed.

Between gasping sobs, Zoe pointed a trembling finger. "Evelyn... you've already taken Dominic from me... was my unborn child a threat too?"

A cold realization washed over Evelyn. This was a trap. But why would Zoe risk her own pregnancy?

Unless she knew this would be the final straw to turn Dominic against Evelyn permanently. The thought chilled her to the bone.

"You're willing to sacrifice your own child to frame me?" Evelyn's voice shook with outrage. "You don't deserve to be a mother!"

"The pain... it's unbearable!" Zoe writhed as the bodyguard helped her up. "Everyone saw you push me! If I lose this baby, I'll never forgive you!"

As the bodyguard carried Zoe to the waiting car, Eleanor's rage erupted. Without warning, her palm connected sharply with Evelyn's cheek.

"Dominic's leniency has made you bold, hasn't it?" Eleanor hissed. "That's a Blackwood heir you've harmed! If anything happens to that child, you'll pay with your life!"

The slam of car doors echoed through the suddenly silent estate.

Evelyn's face burned where she'd been struck. Her feet felt rooted to the spot. She hadn't laid a finger on Zoe - this was all a carefully orchestrated lie.

Then, movement caught her eye. Julian emerged from the mansion's shadowed doorway.

Had he witnessed everything? Why hadn't he intervened?

He approached with slow, deliberate steps, stopping inches from Evelyn. A cruel smirk twisted his lips. "My, my... what a pitiful sight you are."

"Spare me your fake concern," Evelyn spat. "Even if I had pushed her, what of it?"

She turned to leave, but Julian's mocking voice followed her.

"If I were you, I'd stay far away from Dominic now," he called after her. "Though I suspect it's too late for that..."

The implication was clear - Zoe's miscarriage would be pinned on Evelyn, and Dominic would never forgive her.

At St. Elizabeth Medical Center, Zoe was rushed into surgery while Eleanor made the fateful call.

"Dominic, I saw it with my own eyes! Evelyn pushed Zoe deliberately!" Eleanor's voice broke with manufactured grief. "She's a monster! Zoe hit the stone fountain and now she's bleeding... our grandchild might..."

Her words dissolved into dramatic sobs, sealing Evelyn's fate with every tear.

###Chapter 349

Dominic's fingers tightened around his phone, his knuckles turning white.

Thirty minutes later, his car screeched to a halt outside St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'm sorry," the doctor said, his voice heavy. "We couldn't save the baby. Miss Montgomery collapsed from grief."

Eleanor Blackwood stood nearby, her face streaked with silent tears. She couldn't bring herself to speak.

Richard Montgomery clutched a small black bag, his expression ashen. Inside lay the lifeless remains of what should have been his grandchild.

"Dominic," Richard spat, his voice trembling with fury. "You couldn't even honor my daughter, but to let someone harm my grandchild? How heartless can you be?"

Dominic's gaze flickered to the bag. "Give me the child."

His emotions were a tangled mess—anger, frustration, but not grief.

Yet the thought of Evelyn being responsible ignited a fire in his chest. A darker voice whispered in his mind—Get a paternity test.

Richard let out a bitter laugh. "Why? So you can pretend to care? This child will never breathe again because of you!" His grip on the bag tightened. "You don’t deserve to be a father. Loving you was the worst mistake my daughter ever made. Even in death, this child will haunt you!"

His words grew more venomous, each syllable dripping with hatred.

A bodyguard stepped forward, trying to intervene. The two men shoved each other, tension crackling in the air.

Then—a nurse's panicked shout cut through the chaos.

"Dr. Shaw! Patient in bed thirty-eight is hemorrhaging!"

Dominic turned. Through the open door, he saw Zoe lying motionless, her skin ghostly pale.

His chest tightened. He strode inside.

The doctor checked her vitals, his expression grim. "She's losing too much blood. We need to stop it—now!"

At Thornfield Industries, Evelyn couldn't focus.

Her phone sat on her desk, silent.

What happened to Zoe?

She had waited all morning for news. There should have been an update by now.

Did the baby survive?

If not, why hadn’t Dominic called to accuse her? She prayed the child was alive. She didn’t need this nightmare.

"Evelyn, lunch?" Michael Sterling poked his head into her office.

She shook her head. "Not hungry. Go ahead."

"I'll bring you something. What do you want?"

"Anything."

Michael frowned. "You okay? You look off." He reached out, pressing a hand to her forehead. "No fever. Who pissed you off?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Eleanor called me this morning—on Zoe's behalf. I was set up."

Then—her phone rang.

Dominic’s name flashed on the screen. Her pulse spiked.

She answered. His voice was deceptively calm.

"Evelyn. Should I come to you, or will you come to the hospital?"

Beneath the icy control, she heard the storm.

She didn’t want to see him. Not now. Not ever.

"I didn’t push Zoe," she said, her voice steady. "I tried to leave. She grabbed me. I shook her off—that’s all. She fell on her own!"

His laugh was cold. "So my mother and everyone else lied?"

Evelyn’s lips curled. "And what if I did push her?" she challenged. "Will you avenge her?"

###Chapter 350

Dominic was silent for a long moment. He'd never imagined Evelyn could be this heartless.

"Evelyn, we're talking about a human life!" His voice was a low growl. "How can you be so cruel?"

"Is your child really gone?" Evelyn inhaled sharply, raising her glass mockingly toward Zoe. "Is Zoe secretly celebrating right now?"

"Trading her own baby to frame me - no wonder she's the woman who's stayed by your side all these years!"

Every word Evelyn spoke carried venomous implications. Not only was she calling Zoe ruthless, but she was implying Dominic shared that same darkness.

Dominic's expression turned stormy. "She's hemorrhaging right now while doctors fight to save her. If this was all part of some scheme, then she gambled not just her child's life but her own. Do you really think you're so clever?"

Evelyn's lips parted, but no sound emerged.

"Evelyn, this time... I won't show mercy." Dominic enunciated each syllable before the line went dead.

The phone slipped from Evelyn's trembling fingers. Her face drained of color as if all vitality had been sucked from her body.

Michael watched her with growing concern. From the fragments he'd overheard, the situation sounded dire. "Evelyn, what the hell happened?"

She forced composure. "Nothing important. Go get lunch."

"Don't give me that! I heard enough. Zoe lost the baby. Did she blame you? That conniving witch deserves worse than a beating!" Michael's hands clenched into fists, his temper flaring.

"Violence won't help. She's bleeding out while they try to save her." Evelyn's voice was eerily calm. "I'm starting to wonder if I really did push her. Maybe it's my fault she's dying. But if she planned this... the price was too high."

Michael's brow furrowed. "Is Dominic coming after you?"

"Don't worry about me. Even if he seeks revenge, he won't bury me with his unborn child." Her tone was matter-of-fact.

"That fetus wasn't even fully formed yet - technically not human! I studied biology!" Michael blurted. "But he'll want blood for this."

"Go eat."

"But I'm worried sick!"

"Will your worry stop his vengeance?" Evelyn rose and physically pushed Michael toward the door. "Bring me back something edible."

"Evelyn, if he shows up, call me immediately. I'll protect you," Michael insisted.

"Sure."

Alone again, Evelyn collapsed into her chair.

Her nails dug into her palms as she replayed the morning's events.

Zoe had arranged their meeting at the old Thornfield estate through Eleanor. Every word had been calculated to provoke. Every interaction designed to infuriate.

Evelyn had tried leaving multiple times, but Zoe's grip had been ironclad. If Zoe had simply wanted to talk, a phone call would have sufficed. The elaborate setup at the mansion now seemed glaringly obvious.

The more Evelyn analyzed it, the clearer the trap became.

Having given birth herself, Evelyn knew the medical realities. A simple fall shouldn't cause miscarriage, let alone life-threatening hemorrhage.

Zoe couldn't have predicted the complications, but gambling with her child's life proved she felt nothing for it.

Yet Zoe desperately wanted to marry Dominic - how could she not care about his heir?

Unless... there was something wrong with the pregnancy. The realization sent ice sliding down Evelyn's spine.

###Chapter 351

The clock struck five at Mooncrest Academy.

It was the bodyguard’s first day on duty. After picking up the children, he escorted them home.

"Uncle Bodyguard, can Lily and Henry play outside for a bit?" Lily gazed up at him, her eyes sparkling with mischief. She was testing the limits.

The bodyguard answered firmly, "Of course! But only after dinner."

Lily pouted. "What’s for dinner? Are we ordering takeout, or are you cooking? And when do you get off work?"

The bodyguard chuckled. "I’m off when your mom or Uncle Michael gets home. If you’d like, I can whip something up for you."

Lily tilted her head. "Then do we need to go grocery shopping? If you cook, does Mom have to pay you extra? But what if your food tastes bad? Does she still pay you extra?"

The bodyguard laughed. "Your mom pays me enough to cook ten meals a day for you two!"

With that, he took the kids to the supermarket.

At seven in the evening, his phone buzzed. It was Michael.

"How are the kids?" Michael asked before adding, "I might be late tonight. They go to bed at nine. If Evelyn and I aren’t back by then, you can clock out."

Michael couldn’t find Evelyn. He’d gone to her office, but she wasn’t there.

He’d called her—no answer. When he tried again, her phone was off.

Fury burned through him. Dominic must have taken her. Michael couldn’t reach him either.

Gripping the steering wheel, Michael sped toward Dominic’s mansion, his Bluetooth earpiece crackling. "How can they blame Evelyn for Zoe’s miscarriage? She’d never do something like that!" he ranted to Nathan on the other end.

Nathan sighed. "Mr. Blackwood didn’t come to work today. I heard about Zoe’s situation, but I wasn’t there. I can’t comment. My advice? Don’t lose your temper. They’re adults—they’ll handle it."

"Adults?" Michael scoffed. "Evelyn might be, but your boss? Doubtful. He called her this afternoon and threatened her. I heard every word! If anything happens to her, I swear—"

Nathan’s voice turned icy. "What exactly do you plan to do to Mr. Blackwood?"

"Expose him. I’ve got enough dirt to bury him."

"You’re insane. He’ll have you arrested before you blink." Nathan adjusted his glasses. "Calm down. Let me make some calls and see if anyone knows where he is."

Meanwhile, Evelyn stood in a lavish hotel suite, staring at Dominic in disbelief. He’d summoned her here to "resolve" things.

She hadn’t expected him to confiscate her phone and bring her to a hotel.

"Dominic, how exactly are we resolving this?" she demanded, crossing her arms.

"Let’s eat first." He picked up the room service menu, unfazed.

Evelyn scanned the opulent presidential suite. A sinking feeling settled in her chest.

She marched to the door and yanked it open. Two stone-faced bodyguards blocked her path.

Gasping, she stumbled back and slammed the door.

"Dominic, are you holding me prisoner?" She stormed toward him, snatched the menu, and hurled it to the floor.

Dominic’s gaze turned glacial. "You took my child. Now you’ll give me one in return."

###Chapter 352 Give Him One in Return?

Evelyn thought her ears were deceiving her. A child wasn't some commodity to be traded - how could he demand one as repayment?

The confusion must have shown on her face because Dominic stated coldly, "You'll use that womb of yours to produce another. I don't care if it's born breathing or not - as long as it carries my blood!"

A violent shudder ran through Evelyn's body. "Dominic! Have you lost your damn mind?" she screamed hysterically.

Had he forgotten? When she'd been pregnant with his children before, he'd dragged her to that abortion clinic himself!

Now he was demanding she bear his child? What did he think she was? Some breeding mare to be used at his whim?

Conceive when he wanted, terminate when he didn't?

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

"Yes! I'm completely insane!" His eyes burned crimson with barely contained rage. "You did this to me, Evelyn! Your endless lies and deception - you've pushed me past all limits of patience!"

The sheer ferocity in his expression made Evelyn shrink back instinctively.

She stumbled backward until her legs hit the sofa, collapsing onto it.

"Mercy is no longer an option," Dominic hissed, looming over her. "You made your choices - now face the consequences. Whether the child lives or dies means nothing to me. From tonight onward, you'll come whenever I summon you. This continues until you're carrying my heir."

Evelyn's fingers twisted into the sofa cushions as Dominic's shadow engulfed her. The thought of bringing another life into this nightmare - only for him to treat it with the same cruelty - made her stomach churn.

"No!" she spat defiantly. "Find some other woman to torture!"

"This isn't a negotiation." His voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "Run to the ends of the earth if you must - I'll drag you back. Your only paths to freedom are death... or giving me what I want. And if you choose death?" A cruel smirk twisted his lips. "Your children will pay the price."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

His icy fingers began methodically unbuttoning her blouse, stripping away her dignity one button at a time.

Meanwhile, Michael Sterling parked outside the Blackwood estate, concocting his cover story for the guard.

"I'm Michael - an old friend of Mr. Blackwood's. He invited me for drinks." Best to get inside first, then improvise.

The guard recognized him - not as Dominic's friend, but as Evelyn's.

"Mr. Blackwood isn't home. Come back later."

"Do you know when he'll return?"

"No idea."

"Is Sophia here then? Sophia and I are close." Michael's mind raced. Then he shouted toward the mansion, "Sophia! It's Michael! Lily and Henry sent me to check on you!"

The commotion drew Mrs. Wilkins outside.

"Mrs. Wilkins! Is Sophia home? Tell her to let me in!" Michael called desperately.

Moments later, Mrs. Wilkins emerged with Sophia in tow.

Seeing Michael, Sophia immediately moved to open the gate. In this household, after Dominic, her word was law. The guards wouldn't dare contradict her.

"Sophia! Evelyn's missing! I think Dominic took her!" Michael grasped her hands urgently. "Come with me - we'll trade you for Evelyn's safety. Please!"

Sophia nodded without hesitation. Michael nearly cheered - his plan was working perfectly!
###Chapter 353

Michael shared his brilliant plan with Nathan.

Nathan shook his head. "Mr. Blackwood won't be intimidated. Sophia's caretaker and security detail never leave her side. Moving her to Evelyn's place would just be changing residences."

Michael looked perplexed.

Nathan continued, "Mr. Blackwood won't hurt Evelyn. You have my word on that."

"How can you be so sure?" Michael challenged.

"If you don't trust me, fine! I'm at the hospital with Zoe right now. She still hasn't regained consciousness," Nathan replied.

Michael's tension eased slightly. "How is she doing?"

"She's been in a coma since the transfusion."

"Evelyn insists she didn't push Zoe. What do you think Zoe's game is?" Michael pondered. "Could the baby not have been Dominic's?"

"Of course you'd take Evelyn's side. The truth isn't always clear," Nathan said objectively.

Michael chuckled darkly. "I'm betting that child wasn't Dominic's. If it had been his, she would've fought tooth and nail. She wouldn't have gone down from one little push. You should get Dominic to demand a paternity test."

"Can't be done. Zoe's father took the remains from the hospital."

Michael burst into laughter.

"This isn't funny. Zoe's still fighting for her life. Regardless of paternity, it's irrelevant now," Nathan said sharply. "The child is gone."

"How is that irrelevant? Evelyn's being falsely accused!" Michael snapped.

"Don't be so dramatic. Mr. Blackwood never wanted that child. Now that it's gone, he might even thank Evelyn!" Nathan countered. "Evelyn's not home right now - shouldn't you be watching the kids?"

"We hired security."

"Then just wait at Mr. Blackwood's office! I've checked everywhere. No one knows where he is either."

Michael's brow furrowed with concern.

"By the way, I heard some news today." Before hanging up, Nathan suddenly remembered. "Margaret sold her overseas cosmetics company. Cashed out for four hundred fifty million. Looks like she's preparing to return."

"That witch! When she comes back, I'll make sure she regrets it!"

"Don't underestimate her. Margaret's shrewd. If she's returning, she's got a plan. Warn Evelyn to be careful," Nathan advised, then changed subjects. "You should go home! Camping at Mr. Blackwood's office is pointless."

"Always protecting your boss!" Michael growled before ending the call.

Meanwhile, Evelyn lay exhausted in the hotel suite, convinced she might not survive the night.

The hunger gnawed at her, but Dominic's relentless attentions were worse. He seemed to possess boundless energy when it came to tormenting her.

At two AM, a knock interrupted them. Dominic stilled. Evelyn hastily pulled the sheets over herself.

Donning a robe, Dominic went to the door.

"Mr. Blackwood, Miss Montgomery has regained consciousness. She's asking for you," the bodyguard reported.

Dominic glanced back at the disheveled bed. "Stay here. Don't let her leave."

"Yes, sir!"

Evelyn's eyes burned with fury. He'd had his fill of her! Why not release her now?

"Dominic! You can't keep me prisoner here!" Wrapping the sheet around herself, she staggered from the bed, her body aching.

Dominic swept her up effortlessly, depositing her back on the mattress.

His distinctive scent enveloped her as he murmured, "I'll release you after twenty-four hours. What if you take emergency contraception? Then tonight's efforts would be wasted."
###Chapter 354

Evelyn clutched Dominic's robe with trembling fingers, her crimson-rimmed eyes blazing with defiance. "My body, my choice! Don't you dare cross that line! Push me further and you'll regret it!"

Her sharp cry sliced through the midnight silence.

His throat moved visibly as he swallowed hard.

"Give me back my phone!" Evelyn glared at his exposed neck, contemplating whether to sink her teeth into that tempting pulse point if he refused.

"Evelyn, mark my words." Dominic's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "If I find out you took any birth control, you'll be sharing my bed indefinitely!"

He tossed the phone onto the mattress. The moment her fingers closed around it, Evelyn sprang from the bed like a startled doe. She scrambled for her discarded clothes, dressing with frantic movements.

Before storming out, she slammed the door so hard the frame rattled.

The city streets lay deserted at 2:30 AM. The crisp night air washed over her, stripping away the lingering exhaustion.

Her phone screen illuminated with dozens of missed calls - all from Michael. Her thumb hovered over the callback button. How could she possibly explain tonight's events?

The entire encounter felt surreal, like some twisted dream she couldn't wake from.

Meanwhile, Dominic stood in Zoe's hospital room at three in the morning. The moment she saw him, fresh tears spilled down her pale cheeks.

He reached for a tissue, dabbing gently at her face.

"Zoe, you need to stop this."

"Our baby... gone. I... can't... breathe..." Her words came in shuddering gasps between sobs. "My fault... should've... protected..."

"You'll have other children," Dominic murmured, though the words sounded hollow even to him. "Rest now."

Zoe's tear-filled eyes locked onto his. "The doctors said... never again! Dominic, our baby was almost fully formed! Do you know what they showed me?"

"I know."

"It's Evelyn's fault—"

"Why did you summon Evelyn?" Dominic cut in sharply. "You involved my mother to bring her here. Was that necessary?"

A fresh wave of tears cascaded down Zoe's face. "I regret everything! After you broke our engagement... when you said you loved her... I lost myself. I just wanted to disappear... but first, I needed to see her. To beg her to accept our child if you two—"

Dominic studied Zoe's anguished expression. "So she pushed you?"

Zoe drew a shaky breath. "Maybe seeing proof of our love triggered her? She clearly still has feelings for you. I never imagined she'd be capable of such cruelty—"

Dominic's expression darkened like gathering storm clouds. If Zoe spoke truth, Evelyn's actions were unforgivable.

"Every time I close my eyes... I see our baby... covered in blood... screaming for help—"

"Enough!" Dominic's command sliced through her hysterics. "The child is gone. Dwelling on it helps nothing."

"Dominic, will our baby's death go unpunished?" Zoe whispered between ragged breaths.

"I'll deal with Evelyn. Focus on recovering."

"Thank you... I'm sorry for disturbing you so..." Zoe's voice trailed off as exhaustion claimed her.
###Chapter 355

"It's alright." Dominic studied Evelyn's ashen face, a pang of sympathy tightening his chest. "Get some rest. I'll come by tomorrow."

"Okay."

Stepping out of the hospital, Dominic turned to his bodyguard. "What happened to the remains?"

"Mr. Montgomery took them to the crematorium."

Dominic's jaw clenched. He'd wanted a DNA test, but that option had vanished in smoke.

The bodyguard hesitated. "Sir, Mr. Montgomery was... distraught. When I offered assistance, he thought I was trying to take the child from him. He became violent."

Dominic's expression darkened as he slid into the car.

At dawn, the family physician was summoned to Mooncrest Manor.

Dominic hadn't slept. Bloodshot eyes burned beneath furrowed brows, giving him a dangerously unhinged aura.

"Mr. Blackwood, I heard about Miss Montgomery's miscarriage," the doctor ventured cautiously. "You're both young. There will be other opportunities—"

"I didn't call you for condolences." Dominic drained his espresso. "Eric Montclair's surgery. Evelyn performed it."

The doctor stiffened. "Your ex-wife? Evelyn Thorne?"

"Exactly. What's your professional opinion?"

Adjusting his glasses, the doctor exhaled sharply. "While I knew she studied under Professor Whitmore, brain surgery is... extraordinary for someone so young."

"How do I verify her actual capabilities?"

"Without witnessing the procedure or her admitting it?" The doctor spread his hands. "Nearly impossible."

"Montclair claims Whitmore designed the treatment." Dominic's gaze turned razor-sharp. "Given those plans, would you attempt such surgery?"

The doctor paled. "Why not ask her directly?"

Dominic's laugh held no humor. "If she gave straight answers, we wouldn't be having this conversation."

"Well... with Professor Whitmore's guidance, I might attempt it. But success wouldn't be guaranteed." The doctor swallowed. "Miss Thorne succeeded. That speaks volumes. Though whether she surpasses Miss Montgomery..."

Dominic's fingers tightened around his cup. "Even if she's brilliant, she'd never help Sophia."

"Miss Montgomery's skills are more than adequate. If Miss Thorne refuses, she remains your best option."

A curt nod.

"The remains. Cremation doesn't leave DNA evidence?"

The doctor shook his head. "You suspected paternity? Without samples, it's irretrievable. Were there other sources?"

"It happened too fast. By the time I arrived, Richard had already left with..." Dominic trailed off.

"Then no. But why doubt Miss Montgomery?"

"We slept together once. I was drunk." Dominic's voice turned gravelly. "I still don't know if it was really her that night."

The doctor blinked. "Statistically, conception from a single encounter is improbable. Even during ovulation. Didn't you investigate?"

"I asked Evelyn." Dominic's knuckles whitened. "She denied ever sleeping with me." His lips twisted. "Though I've learned her words are worthless."

"Miss Thorne doesn't strike me as deceitful."

"To others? Perhaps. To me?" A hollow laugh. "She's a master liar."

"Why?"

"If I knew that," Dominic rasped, "I wouldn't be losing sleep over her." Evelyn's words had haunted him through the night—each syllable a blade twisting between truth and lies.

"Have you seen her son?" Dominic's throat worked. "The boy... resembles me. She claims he's adopted. If she despises me so much, why choose a child who looks like me?"
###Chapter 356

"Mr. Blackwood, I distinctly recall your security detail escorting Miss Thorne to the women's clinic," the family physician remarked.

"Indeed. My head of security personally confirmed she entered the surgical suite." Dominic had verified this detail earlier. "The attending physician even provided postoperative care instructions."

"Then the pregnancy was undoubtedly terminated," the doctor concluded. "Perhaps the adopted child resembles you because she's memorializing the one she lost."

"Is that why Evelyn despises me so intensely?" Dominic wondered silently.

Meanwhile, in the master suite of Mooncrest Manor, Michael and the twins watched over Evelyn's sleeping form with concern.

Michael had attempted calling her at 1 AM with no response. Her unexpected return home left him puzzled about her whereabouts earlier.

"Are there bugs in our house?" Lily inquired innocently.

Michael scanned the room. "Not that I've seen. Did something bite you?"

"Something bit Mommy!" Lily's wide eyes focused on Evelyn's neck. "Look! The bug left a huge mark!"

Michael followed Lily's pointing finger.

"That's... Based on my extensive life experience, I can confidently say no insect caused that. Those are clearly passion marks," Henry deduced silently.

"Let's let her rest." Michael scooped up both children. "Breakfast first, then I'll take you somewhere fun."

"I want to stay until Mommy wakes up," Lily pouted. "It's been forever since we played together!"

Henry nodded emphatically.

"Fine, stay home after we eat." Michael yawned. "I've got overtime at the office today... but I'll leave after your mother's awake."

"Why didn't Mommy come home last night?" Henry asked pointedly.

"Blame Dominic!" Michael's gaze darkened at the visible evidence of Evelyn's night. "Zoe lost her baby. Do you understand what that means?"

Henry nodded while Lily shook her head.

"Zoe was carrying Dominic's child, right? That baby died last night. She's claiming your mother pushed her, causing the miscarriage," Michael explained.

Henry's eyes turned glacial. "That wretched Zoe! Framing my mother? She'll regret this."

Lily crushed her pancake angrily. "Mommy would never do that!"

"Obviously not! But Zoe's insisting she did, so that bastard Dominic went after your mom last night." Michael took an aggressive bite of toast. "I'm getting her a bodyguard."

"Give her ours," Henry suggested.

"I'll hire someone new." Michael waved his fork. "Don't worry about adult problems. I'll handle it!"

"Do it now, Uncle Michael!" Lily insisted. "I won't let that mean man hurt Mommy again!"

"Immediately!" Henry seconded.

"Alright, alright!" Michael gulped his orange juice and stood. "Going now! Stay put and don't wander off!"

After Michael departed, Lily settled by Evelyn's bedside with her dolls, determined to be the first face her mother saw upon waking.

Henry retreated to their playroom and powered up his laptop.

Zoe Montgomery would learn the consequences of crossing his family.

Exactly sixty-three minutes later, a black Bentley pulled into the driveway, its chime echoing through the mansion. Both children sprinted toward the entrance.

###Chapter 357

The surveillance feed showed a formidable woman in her sixties standing at the gates when Evelyn and the children arrived home.

Henry's eyes widened in recognition. "That's Dominic's mother!"

"Oh," Lily chirped, "so she's our grandmother!"

"Don't call her that!" Henry corrected sharply. "She's probably here to cause trouble for Mom!"

"Hmph! We won't let her bully Mom! Let's teach her a lesson!"

Henry dashed inside to retrieve his drone while Lily trailed behind him.

Eleanor Blackwood stood outside the wrought iron gates, her lips pressed into a thin line as she waited for Evelyn to answer. She hadn't slept a wink all night, consumed by restless agitation that drove her to confront Evelyn personally.

Suddenly, the mechanical whirring of an engine sounded overhead. Eleanor looked up just as crimson liquid began raining down from the hovering drone. The paint splattered across her designer coat, sending her scrambling toward her limousine with a shriek.

The commotion woke Evelyn. She threw off the covers and rushed to the window, then bolted from her room when she saw the scene unfolding outside.

Eleanor had taken refuge in her car, her face flushed with rage. Mrs. Wilkins helped remove the ruined coat and dabbed at the red stains with wet wipes.

"Madam, it appears to be acrylic paint," the housekeeper observed.

"How utterly savage!" Eleanor hissed through clenched teeth. "I didn't believe she could do such things to Zoe, but now I've seen her true colors!"

The mansion doors flew open moments later, revealing Evelyn in her silk pajamas. She approached the black limo just as Eleanor emerged with Mrs. Wilkins' assistance.

"Evelyn Thorne!" Eleanor sputtered, trembling with indignation. "Look what you've done!"

Both children burst through the door despite Evelyn's orders to stay inside. Lily planted herself between her mother and Eleanor.

"Mom had nothing to do with this! Henry and I did it!" Lily declared.

Eleanor's breath caught when she saw the children. Though she'd heard about Evelyn's twins, seeing them in person was another matter entirely.

"You're trespassing! This is our home and we'll defend it!" Lily continued, jutting her chin defiantly. "You wouldn't be covered in paint if you'd stayed away!"

Eleanor's gaze darted between the children, lingering on Henry's face. The resemblance struck her like a physical blow - he was the spitting image of Dominic at that age.

"I came to speak with your mother," Eleanor managed. "How dare you be so disrespectful!"

"I don't want you talking to Mom at all!" Lily crossed her arms. "Leave now or Henry will send his drone after you again!"

Evelyn quickly ushered the children inside before returning to face Eleanor. "If this is about Zoe, I'm innocent. Your son has already addressed this matter, so there's no need for your involvement."

"Evelyn," Eleanor's voice shook, "your son... who is his father?"

"He's adopted from an orphanage," Evelyn replied coolly, eyeing the paint stains. "I apologize for my children's behavior."

Eleanor seemed not to hear. She clutched Mrs. Wilkins' arm and retreated to the limousine. Once inside, she whispered urgently, "Did you see that boy? He looks exactly like Dominic as a child."

"Do you think... could he be Dominic's son?" Mrs. Wilkins ventured.

###Chapter 358

Eleanor Blackwood's expression darkened. "Those children can't possibly look that similar without being related. I'm certain that boy is my grandson! Dominic was exactly like that at his age - always giving people that same icy stare. And those eyes... they're identical to mine!"

"But Master Dominic doesn't seem suspicious about the boy's background," the nanny pointed out.

"Dominic doesn't know himself as well as I do. He's probably forgotten what he looked like as a child."

"That's true. So what do you plan to do?"

Eleanor's eyes gleamed with determination. "I need to confirm whether Dominic is that boy's father. For that, I'll need a DNA test."

"Well... you'd need the child's hair or blood sample for that..."

"Where there's a will, there's a way." Eleanor's voice brimmed with confidence. "I'll inform Dominic once I have the results."

Meanwhile, Zoe Montgomery lay in her hospital bed, scrolling through news on her phone.

The miscarriage meant she had to remain under observation for several days. Dominic had visited briefly that morning, but within ten minutes of arriving, he'd received a phone call and left abruptly.

Without the pregnancy, Eleanor had also started paying Zoe less attention.

A twinge of disappointment pricked at Zoe, but the $155 million Dominic had transferred to her account quickly soothed her irritation.

Money couldn't buy everything, but it certainly bought happiness.

She'd accepted Dominic's payment without hesitation. Naturally, she'd continue searching for a cure for Sophia. She knew Dominic would keep treating her well if Sophia showed any improvement.

For now, Dominic still needed her - and $155 million was just the beginning of what she intended to extract from him.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed with an incoming message.

Zoe tapped it absentmindedly. A video began playing.

Her eyes widened in horror as she recognized the figures on screen.

"Wait! That's me! And that man... Julian!" she gasped.

It was footage from that night with Julian. They'd searched the entire room thoroughly and found no cameras. Yet here was undeniable proof of everything that had happened between them, every intimate detail exposed.

Zoe's face burned with humiliation. Her hands trembled so violently she nearly dropped the phone.

"Who sent this?" she thought frantically.

She checked the sender information, but the field was blank.

"What the hell is happening?!" Panic clawed at her throat.

Her fingers flew across the screen as she typed a reply: (Who are you? Trying to blackmail me? Dream on! Dominic and I are already over, so this means nothing!)

Before sending, she hesitated, then deleted the entire message.

Even though their relationship had ended, Dominic would despise her if this video surfaced. And she still needed more money from him.

After several false starts, she finally settled on: (Name your price. How much do you want?)

Though their engagement had ended, Zoe knew this video could destroy her reputation completely. She'd already become the laughingstock of her social circle after Dominic called off their wedding. If this footage leaked, everyone would assume he'd dumped her because she'd cheated.

Meanwhile, at Mooncrest Manor, other events were unfolding...
###Chapter 359

Henry contemplated whether he should swindle Zoe out of her entire fortune when her message popped up on his screen.

Zoe had ended things with Dominic and lost their baby, so the compromising video couldn't harm him anymore.

"How could you two do such a thing?" Evelyn took a sip of water before marching to the children's room to reprimand them.

"Regardless of our personal conflicts, she's in her seventies! What if the shock had made her ill?"

Lily blinked her big innocent eyes. "But Mommy, you could heal her if she got sick."

"I'm not magical! I can't cure every disease in the world!"

"But she didn't get sick! She was screaming at you!" Lily muttered under her breath, "Mom, we can't let people treat you badly!"

Evelyn's heart melted at her daughter's protective words.

"Nobody's bullying me. I'm tougher than that," she reassured them, trying to sound convincing.

"But you didn't come home last night... Henry and I waited so long... Uncle Michael said that horrible man took you away..." Lily pouted stubbornly. "When we're bigger, we'll make him pay!"

Touched beyond words, Evelyn scooped her daughter into her arms. "I can protect myself, sweetheart. You and your brother just focus on growing up happy and healthy! How about I take you both out for ice cream?"

"Yay! Mommy, it's been forever since our last ice cream date!" Lily sniffled dramatically.

Meanwhile, Henry had already replied to Zoe's message.

Zoe stared at the cryptic response from the anonymous sender, her brow furrowing in confusion.

"A thousand Beta Coins? What in the world are Beta Coins?" After a quick internet search, her confusion turned to shock.

Beta Coins were an untraceable international cryptocurrency.

She had to admire the blackmailer's cleverness. Demanding traditional currency would have allowed her to involve the authorities, but this method protected her reputation while emptying her wallet.

A price check made her gasp aloud.

Each Beta Coin traded at twenty thousand dollars. A thousand coins meant twenty million dollars gone.

Zoe's stomach twisted. Though Dominic had paid her one hundred fifty-five million, that money represented years of sacrifice. Losing twenty million felt like having chunks of flesh carved from her body.

After an agonizing internal debate, she purchased the cryptocurrency and transferred it to the specified wallet.

Henry immediately powered down his laptop the moment the transaction cleared.

"Henry, your birthday is coming up soon. Let's go shopping for new outfits, shall we?" Evelyn changed clothes and gathered the children.

Their bodyguard waited patiently by the door.

"Mommy, this uncle cooks amazing food." Spotting the bodyguard, Lily immediately turned to Evelyn. "He made us dinner last night! We ate everything!"

Evelyn smiled at the bodyguard. "Thank you for looking after them."

"Just doing my job," the bodyguard replied modestly.

Once in the car, Evelyn checked her phone and found a photo from Sophie, who was getting her nails done.

"Evelyn! Found this incredible nail salon! Come join me! Bring the kids too! I have HUGE news to share!"

Evelyn grinned at her best friend's message, already guessing what the "huge news" entailed.

"Should we go see Aunt Sophie?" she asked the children.

"Yes! I love Aunt Sophie!" Lily cheered immediately.

Henry simply nodded his silent agreement.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn arrived at the upscale nail salon with Lily and Henry in tow.

###Chapter 360

The nail salon was nestled inside an exclusive luxury boutique. Evelyn had only known it as a high-end brand for handbags and couture, so discovering they'd ventured into nail artistry was a delightful surprise.

"Evelyn! Adrian and I are getting married in May!" Sophie squealed, her eyes sparkling with excitement. "And you absolutely must be my maid of honor! Lily and Henry can be our ring bearers!"

Evelyn sighed, shaking her head. "The kids would love to be ring bearers, but I can't be your maid of honor. You should ask someone else."

As a divorced mother, tradition dictated she wasn't suited for the role.

"I already talked to my parents and Adrian! They all agreed it's fine." Sophie tugged Evelyn down beside her. "Now, let's get matching manicures!"

"Matching nails, sure, but the maid of honor thing is a hard no." Evelyn lowered her voice, her fingers tracing the edge of the polish display. "Unlike me, I want your marriage to be perfect, Sophie. I'm content with where I am, but I want more for you."

Sophie's bright smile faltered for a second before she squeezed Evelyn's hand. "Fine, I won't push. But mark my words—you'll find someone incredible, and you'll be happier than you ever imagined."

Evelyn nodded, glancing at Sophie's half-finished nails. "How much longer? You've been here a while."

"Since this morning. I picked intricate designs, so it's taking forever, but look how gorgeous they're turning out!" Sophie admired her nails with satisfaction.

"I'll just do a simple polish. I brought the kids, and they’ll get restless if this takes too long." Evelyn glanced toward Lily and Henry, who were peering curiously at the array of colors.

"Mommy, I want pretty nails too!" Lily stared wide-eyed at Sophie's glittering fingertips.

"Not yet, sweetheart. When you're older."

"Mom, we won’t get bored." Henry gently pulled Lily back. "You should get the same design as Aunt Sophie."

Sophie beamed at him. "Henry, you think my nails are pretty?"

He nodded solemnly.

"See? Your son has excellent taste! Just match mine. I’m almost done anyway, and if they get antsy, I’ll take them out for ice cream."

True to her word, once Sophie finished, she whisked the kids away, leaving Evelyn to enjoy her pampering in peace.

Sophie, always full of energy, completely lost herself in spoiling the children. She took them shopping, treated them to decadent desserts, and then—to Evelyn’s shock—ended up at a theme park halfway across the city.

When Evelyn finally finished her nails, she called Sophie. Upon hearing their location, she groaned. "You’re kidding! That’s practically another time zone. At this rate, I might as well go home and nap."

By the time she reached them, it’d be dark.

Sophie’s laughter rang through the phone. "Go sleep, then! Lily told me Dominic kidnapped you last night and you didn’t come home until dawn. True story?"

Evelyn’s cheeks warmed. She hadn’t expected Lily to spill everything. "He didn’t kidnap me. I went willingly," she muttered.

"Oh? So he came crawling back after Zoe lost the baby? That snake! Block him and never speak to him again!" Sophie huffed.

"Blocking his number won’t stop him. He knows where I live. Avoiding him won’t solve anything."

"True, but what’s the point of him harassing you? You didn’t push Zoe, and even if you had, she definitely started it. It’s not like you can magically give him back his baby," Sophie pointed out.

Evelyn stepped out of the salon, phone in hand, weaving through displays of designer handbags. As she glanced up, her breath caught.

There, in the distance, stood a figure she’d never forget—the woman she longed to see burn.

Maybe her stare was too intense, because Margaret noticed her almost instantly. Their eyes locked, and Margaret’s lips curled into a mocking smirk. Beside her stood a man carrying her shopping bags—Zoe’s father.

###Chapter 361

They had parted ways before, but the man had crawled back to Margaret after she liquidated all her overseas assets for a staggering four hundred and fifty million.

"Richard, I heard Dominic gifted your daughter one hundred and fifty-five million dors yesterday?" Margaret deliberately raised her voice.

Evelyn's father spotted her approaching and puffed out his chest. "Indeed he did. Just last evening."

"Why don't you persuade your precious daughter to invest with me? I could triple that measly sum in weeks," Margaret purred, flashing a calculated smile.

"Absolutely! I'll discuss it with Zoe tonight. She's always admired you and fully supports our relationship."

Margaret's smirk deepened as Evelyn strode toward them. "Welcome back, Evelyn."

Evelyn halted, her glacial stare cutting through the humid air. "Good. Saved me the trouble of hunting you down."

"Oh darling, I returned just for you. Your mother's pathetic life could never compensate for my daughter and brother!" Margaret's manicured finger tapped her chin. "You're in love with Dominic, aren't you? How poetic—I'll destroy you using the very fortune he gave Zoe."

"By all means," Evelyn countered smoothly. "One of us won't survive this."

"My thoughts exactly! Should've eliminated you the moment you became a nuisance," Margaret hissed.

"And I should've excised you like the tumor you are," Evelyn fired back.

The air crackled with barely contained violence. Richard, sensing imminent catastrophe, yanked Margaret away by her designer sleeve.

Returning home, Evelyn's boots crunched over paint-splattered grass. She dragged out the hose, water sluicing away crimson stains. Memories surfaced unbidden—her mother kneeling in this same soil, coaxing life from seedlings, transforming chaos into orderly rows of vegetables. Now only brittle stalks remained.

"She'll pay with more than blood," Evelyn vowed to the twilight.

Dawn found her at the flower market, arms laden with vibrant replacements. After transforming the barren yard into a riot of color, she dialed Sophie.

"Bringing Wesley for barbecue tonight. You in?"

"Can I bring a plus-one?" Sophie's voice sparkled with mischief.

"Obviously! Drag Adrian along!"

Sophie's laughter tinkled through the receiver. "Oh, Adrian's just coming to drink with Michael since Wesley's sober these days."

"You realize Michael will invite Nathan, right?"

A dramatic gasp. "Wait—how serious are those two?"

"Let's just say their one-night stand sparked more than physical chemistry."

Sophie hung up mid-squeal, undoubtedly racing to Mooncrest Manor—gossip this juicy demanded front-row seats.

By sunset, Wesley and Nathan were flipping burgers when Sophie's phone buzzed. "Adrian! Get your gorgeous ass over here now!"

Thirty minutes later, tires crunched gravel. A sleek black Phantom glided to a stop.

Sophie's jaw dropped. "Holy hell—isn't that Dominic's car?"

As if summoned, Dominic's imposing silhouette emerged from the vehicle, casting a long shadow across the laughing group.
###Chapter 362

The amber glow of the streetlights cast long shadows as Dominic stood beneath them. His light camel trench coat fluttered slightly in the evening breeze, a stark contrast to his usual monochromatic wardrobe.

The moment he appeared, the cheerful atmosphere in the yard turned icy. Sophie's jaw tightened visibly, her fingers curling into fists so tight her manicured nails dug into her palms. She looked ready to throw a punch at Dominic's perfectly chiseled face.

Clearly, Adrian had brought the unwelcome guest.

Evelyn averted her gaze the second she spotted Dominic. Though last night's events still burned fresh in her memory, she knew he wouldn't dare cause a scene with so many witnesses present.

Dominic had always believed himself the wronged party, but now the tables had turned. That audacity alone explained his uninvited appearance.

As the two men crossed the yard, Sophie reached out to pinch Adrian's arm hard.

Adrian shrugged helplessly, his expression screaming 'Don't blame me! He invited himself!'

Sophie shoved him toward Evelyn, silently demanding he explain himself.

With an awkward chuckle, Adrian approached Evelyn and pointed at her hands. "Those are...um...amazing nails! Did you and Sophie get matching sets?"

The soft yellow lighting made her manicure shimmer like a cat's eyes in the dark.

After breaking the tension, Adrian leaned in to whisper, "I swear I didn't bring him. I just mentioned coming over, and he insisted on joining—"

"I don't blame you," Evelyn cut him off.

Relief washed over Adrian's face. "I brought some premium whiskey...left it in the trunk. Let me go grab it."

He quickly dragged Sophie away toward the car.

Michael scowled at how Nathan fawned over Dominic. Unable to contain himself, he snapped, "Some people have no shame. Who even invited you?"

Dominic lifted his gaze calmly. "Last I checked, you're the one living off someone else's hospitality. Shouldn't the host decide who stays?"

Michael's blood boiled. Living off hospitality? How dare this bastard imply he was freeloading! This might not be his house, but Dominic knew nothing about his decade-long friendship with Evelyn!

Nathan placed a chair beside Michael and muttered, "Drop it. If Evelyn hasn't said anything, you shouldn't either."

"Evelyn! Kick this shameless bastard out!" Michael demanded loudly.

Every head turned toward Evelyn under the sudden spotlight.

Her voice came out clipped. "You're not welcome here."

She couldn't bear to look at him, and neither could her children. Since Dominic's arrival, the twins had stopped eating, their small hands clenched into fists on the table.

After Evelyn's declaration, all eyes shifted to Dominic, waiting for his reaction.

Any man with pride would have left immediately. But Dominic remained seated, unmoving.

"I don't need your welcome." His voice carried an unsettling calm. "Life doesn't always give us what we want. Sometimes we must endure what we hate and face those we despise."

The group fell into stunned silence. Was he seriously lecturing them? Michael's anger spiked so violently he nearly flipped the barbecue grill.
###Chapter 363

Nathan grabbed a skewer of grilled meat and shoved it into Michael's mouth to silence him before approaching Sophie and Adrian, who had returned with several bottles of wine.

"These are exceptional vintages! Did you raid your father's wine cellar?"

"Raid? It's my family's estate - how could it be stealing?" Adrian uncorked the bottles with practiced ease.

Nathan poured a glass for Dominic first, then served Wesley despite his limited tolerance. "It's a celebration night - I'll indulge a little," Wesley declared.

"You seem unusually cheerful, Mr. Ashford?" Sophie filled his glass while glancing at Evelyn. "Care to join us, Evelyn?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Someone needs to stay sober with the children. Enjoy yourselves!"

"Perfect! Then I'll handle your unwelcome guest!" Sophie declared, settling beside Dominic. "Mr. Blackwood, shouldn't you be comforting your fiancée at the hospital? Surely you're not considering abandoning her after her miscarriage? That would be truly despicable. Or is your relationship purely transactional - just a means for procreation?"

The gathering fell into stunned silence at Sophie's bold confrontation.

Michael suddenly felt like an amateur compared to Sophie's fearless directness.

Dominic's expression darkened dangerously.

"Though I suppose it's understandable," Sophie continued sarcastically. "If she lost the baby from such a minor fall, she must be terribly fragile. I'd probably leave her too! Ms. Montgomery weighs what - 110 pounds? Evelyn barely breaks 100. I'd love to see the surveillance footage showing how Evelyn supposedly overpowered her. Unless your mansion lacks basic security? If Evelyn truly did this, I'll be the first to cut ties."

Adrian sensed the impending storm. He set down his glass, clamped a hand over Sophie's mouth, and physically dragged her away from Dominic.

Nathan raised his glass to diffuse the tension. "Enough unpleasantness! Tonight's for drinking - nobody leaves sober!"

The awkward silence persisted until Wesley clinked glasses with him.

"Who are you challenging? You're a lightweight," Michael teased. "I could drink you under the table in thirty minutes."

"Set a timer then! If I'm still standing after half an hour, you lose!"

"Deal! Prepare for humiliation!"

Their drinking competition began in earnest.

Meanwhile, Adrian had calmed Sophie. He apologized to Dominic while Sophie joined Evelyn at the grill.

Twenty minutes later, Lily approached Dominic with a skewer of "vegetables." "For you!" she announced sweetly.

Dominic eyed the greenery suspiciously. The child couldn't possibly think he'd fall for this - he'd just watched her picking grass from the lawn!

"I prefer meat," he said, studying Lily's face. Her resemblance to Evelyn stayed his hand.

"Mommy says don't be picky! Eat it!" Lily insisted, frowning.

Dominic remained unmoved.

Henry intervened, pulling Lily aside. "Too obviously grass. He's not stupid," the boy observed calmly.

Frustrated, Lily whispered, "But I want his stomach to hurt! I want him in agony!"

"Laxatives."

"Where do we get those? He likes meat - we could mix some in!"

Dominic overheard every word. He thought wryly, "Evelyn's brilliant - how did she raise such transparent schemers?"

###Chapter 364

Dominic turned around and glanced at Henry.

Coincidentally, Henry was staring right back at him.

Father and son locked eyes in a silent battle of wills.

Henry glared before looking away. "Lily, he won't eat anything we offer him."

Lily sighed. "Henry, why do you think he's here?" She despised Dominic with every fiber of her being, yet she couldn't stop stealing glances at him.

"I don't know. Are you finished eating?"

Lily shook her head. "I'm waiting for Mom to bring the ketchup."

Just then, Evelyn stepped out of the house, a bottle of ketchup in hand.

Sophie hurried over and whispered, "Evelyn, you don't keep laxatives in your house, do you?"

Evelyn frowned. "Why?"

Sophie recounted the earlier events. "I nearly died laughing. You should've seen Dominic's face—he was furious but couldn't do a thing! Our Lily is adorable. Who could stay mad at her?"

Evelyn was speechless.

Now she understood why Lily had devoured the sauce so quickly and asked for more—it was to get Evelyn out of the way.

Evelyn placed the meat skewers in front of her children. "I made these for you. Eat up, then head inside when you're done."

"Okay. Mom, come back with us," Lily said.

"Of course," Evelyn replied.

Once the children finished, they dragged Evelyn back into the house. Instead of going upstairs, they lingered on the first floor, playing where everyone could see them.

Half an hour later, Evelyn took them upstairs for their bath.

Meanwhile, the drinking contest between Michael and Nathan ended with Michael's defeat. He hadn't expected Nathan's alcohol tolerance to improve so much.

After losing, the group demanded Michael perform.

Dominic watched disinterestedly before setting down his glass and standing.

Sophie, who had been keeping an eye on him, nudged Adrian.

Adrian quickly intercepted Dominic. "Heading back?"

Dominic gestured toward the mansion. "I need to use the restroom."

"Oh... right." Adrian chuckled awkwardly before returning to Sophie. "He's just going to the bathroom. I can't follow him in there."

Sophie huffed. "This is your fault! Why did you tell him you were coming to Evelyn's? It's like inviting a wolf into the henhouse!"

"I can't lie to him. Besides, he helped me today. How could I deceive him?" Adrian defended. "You never invite me to these gatherings. Why today?"

"Fine, I won't invite you next time!"

"Don't be like that. He won't follow every time. I think he's just... struggling to cope."

"So he came to pick a fight with Evelyn?"

"He hasn't done anything yet, has he?" Adrian countered. "He drank, ate, and—"

"And now he's going to cause trouble," Sophie finished. "He's not going to the bathroom. He's going after Evelyn!"

Upstairs, Evelyn had just finished bathing the children and tucked them in. Exhausted, she retreated to her room—only to freeze when a figure appeared before her.

"You—"

Dominic strode forward, shutting the door and locking it.

"Your house isn't soundproof. Scream if you want an audience." He cornered her, his bloodshot eyes burning into hers.

Evelyn flushed. She'd let her guard down. He hadn't come just for dinner. "Aren't you tired, Dominic?" she hissed.

###Chapter 365

"Are you?" Dominic seized Evelyn's slender wrist, pulling her toward the bed. "You were in such high spirits earlier, inviting everyone over for a barbecue. Did my presence ruin your mood?"

His fingers trailed down the buttons of her blouse.

She caught his hand, her grip tight. "Dominic! Not here!"

"Why not?" His voice was sharp, cutting through her protest. "What’s wrong with your house? Or is it because you’ve had other men in your bed before?"

Evelyn shoved him hard. "Because you’re filthy!"

He stiffened at her words.

She meant it—filthy because he had slept with Zoe Montgomery.

N?vel(D)ra/ma.Org exclusive ? material.

She bolted for the door, unlocking it with trembling fingers. "Get out."

Dominic stared at the open doorway, then stepped forward—and slammed it shut.

"And you’re so pure?" His voice dripped with venom. "You carried another man’s child." He twisted the lock, then hauled her against him, lifting her off her feet.

The scar from her C-section still marked her abdomen. The first time he had seen it, he had frozen—then punished her for it, as if the scar itself had mocked him. She had told him Lily was a test-tube baby, conceived with sperm from a donor bank.

Dominic ignored her words, pressing her down onto the bed. She fought back, arms braced between them.

"Take a shower first!" She turned her face away, nose wrinkling. "You reek of alcohol."

The disgust in her expression ignited something in him. He grabbed her arm, dragging her toward the bathroom. "We’ll shower together."

"No!"

"Or were you planning to run while I was in there?" His grip tightened. He knew her too well.

"This is my house! Where would I even go at this hour?"

"Then we shower together." He yanked her inside, slamming the bathroom door behind them.

Meanwhile, in the yard, Michael swayed on his feet, the alcohol finally hitting him. He blinked, realizing—Dominic had been gone for a while.

"Wait… didn’t that bastard go to the bathroom? Why isn’t he back yet?"

Sophie Mercer, mid-sip, froze. "How long has it been?"

Adrian checked his watch. "An hour. Did he fall in or something?"

Sophie set down her glass and stormed toward the mansion, the others trailing behind.

The first floor was empty.

"He said he was going to the bathroom! There’s no one here!" Sophie hissed. "I told you—he wasn’t here to use the bathroom. He went after Evelyn!"

"Sophie, keep your voice down," Adrian warned. "The kids might be asleep."

She clamped a hand over her mouth, then tiptoed upstairs, the group following.

Sophie cracked open the door to the children’s room. A sliver of light fell across the bed.

Henry’s bright eyes snapped open. He threw off the blanket and sat up instantly.

"Henry…" Lily rubbed her eyes, stirring.

The adults exchanged panicked glances. Great. Now we’ve woken them.

Sophie flushed. "Sorry, sweethearts. We were just looking for Dominic. We think… he might be bothering your mom."

Henry and Lily exchanged a look—then bolted for Evelyn’s room.
###Chapter 366

"Mom!"

The shrill voices of the twins pierced through the grand halls of Mooncrest Manor.

Inside the master suite, Evelyn Thorne froze at the sound of her children's desperate calls. She twisted beneath Dominic Blackwood's weight, her muscles straining as she fought to break free.

"Dominic! Let me go!" Her voice cracked, tears burning at the corners of her eyes.

His grip on her wrists only tightened, his dark eyes flashing with irritation. "I'm not finished," he growled, his breath hot against her skin. "Do you really think they need you right now?"

"It doesn't matter why they're calling for me—they need me!" She thrashed against him, her vision blurring with unshed tears.

Dominic didn't relent. His hold was unyielding, his body pinning her in place.

A tear slipped down her cheek, followed by another. The warmth of frustration and helplessness coiled in her chest.

Outside the door, Lily was on the verge of sobbing. Sophie Mercer quickly scooped her up before she could burst into tears.

"Shh, sweetheart, don't cry," Sophie cooed, carrying her toward the children's room. "Dominic isn't hurting your mom. He wouldn't dare—not with all of us here."

Michael Sterling tested the doorknob, his jaw tightening when he found it locked. He exhaled sharply before lifting Henry into his arms.

"Don't worry, little man," Michael muttered, ruffling the boy's hair. "I'll stand guard. The second that bastard steps out, I'll knock his teeth in."

Henry said nothing, his small face set in a scowl.

Once the children were settled, Sophie and Michael stepped back into the hallway.

"Sophie, you had too much to drink," Adrian Vaughn snapped, rubbing his temples. "You shouldn’t have dragged the kids into this. They’re too young to understand!"

Sophie's cheeks flushed. "Oh, so now it's my fault? If you're so concerned, why don’t you drag Dominic out yourself?"

"I'm not defending him!" Michael shot back.

Nathan Cross scoffed. "Watch your mouth. My boss isn’t some lowlife."

"Lowlife, lowlife, lowlife!" Michael taunted, smirking. "What are you gonna do about it?"

Nathan glanced at the master bedroom door and lowered his voice. "Let's take this downstairs."

The two men disappeared down the staircase.

Adrian checked his watch. "We should head home."

Sophie crossed her arms. "What about the mess outside?"

"Fine, I'll clean it up."

"You better. I'll supervise."

Adrian sighed, pulling her close. "Sweetheart, can you at least pretend to tolerate Dominic for my sake?"

"I can't stand him!" Sophie huffed, stomping down the stairs.

Adrian chuckled. "Evelyn seems fine. You're overreacting."

"Overreacting?" Sophie whirled around.

"Just saying," Adrian raised his hands in surrender. "If Dominic was really hurting her, don’t you think she'd scream for help?"

The group dispersed to clean the yard, but Michael paused, squinting up at the darkened master bedroom window.

"Damn it. Why are the lights off? Did they actually fall asleep?"

Nathan smirked. "Looks like my boss is staying the night. I’ll dismiss the security detail."

"Who said he could stay?"

Nathan arched a brow. "Evelyn did."

Inside the master suite, Dominic finally released Evelyn. She turned away, reaching for the light switch and plunging the room into darkness.

###Chapter 367

The moment Evelyn reached to switch off the lights, Dominic could see the silent tears tracing down her cheeks.

Though his body had found release, his soul remained restless.

Her continued silence twisted the knife deeper in his chest.

Only the dim glow of street lamps illuminated the bedroom. He studied the rigid line of her back, his brows knitting together.

An irresistible urge to close the distance between them seized him. His arm snaked out, fingers brushing her shoulder.

She recoiled violently the instant his warmth touched her skin. "Don't touch me!" Her voice cracked like shattered glass.

"Not happening." His arms became steel bands around her trembling form. He buried his nose in her hair, inhaling her familiar lavender scent. "I'm staying."

Evelyn felt like a butterfly pinned to a board - trapped, helpless, exposed.

Dominic hadn't been cruel this time. But neither had he been kind.

"When has my consent ever mattered?" The bitter thought coiled in her mind. "He takes what he wants without asking. Leaves when it suits him. My feelings are irrelevant."

Morning came too soon. At precisely seven, Evelyn's eyes fluttered open.

The man beside her stirred, bleary-eyed, before rolling over with a grunt.

She dressed in record time and slipped out unnoticed.

Her children were already awake. Henry was carefully combing Lily's tangled curls.

The memory of their frightened cries last night stabbed through Evelyn's heart. She took a steadying breath before entering. "My brilliant babies! You didn't even need Mommy to wake you today!"

She enveloped them in a tight embrace.

"Mommy! Is that mean Dominic gone? Did he hurt you?" Lily's tiny hands gripped Evelyn's sleeves as she scrutinized her mother for injuries.

Evelyn forced a smile. "He didn't hurt me. And if he ever tries, I'll make him regret it. Okay, sweetheart?"

Lily exhaled dramatically. "I knew my mommy could beat up any bad guy!"

"That's right!" Turning to Henry, she ruffled his hair. "How about I take my favorite people out for breakfast?"

Henry nodded stiffly.

"I'm fine, really." She fetched his favorite cap from the closet. "You love hats, don't you? I'll buy you the coolest ones in town."

Henry's jaw clenched. Evelyn could practically feel his anger radiating - he hadn't forgotten how she'd ignored their cries last night.

Guilt churned in her stomach.

After helping them wash up, they headed for the door. Passing the master bedroom, Henry glared at the closed door. He just knew Dominic was still inside.

At nine sharp, Blackwood family bodyguards delivered fresh clothes to Mooncrest Manor.

Dominic was tying his tie when his phone rang. He answered while descending the stairs.

Nathan's panicked voice crackled through. "Mr. Blackwood! Our mainframe's been breached! The hacker left... a message."

Dominic froze. "Continue."

"He claims to be your father. Says to 'learn your place' or he'll crash our systems daily."

###Chapter 368

Dominic Blackwood let out a cold chuckle, his lips curling in amusement. "Henry Thorne wants to play daddy? How utterly ridiculous."

Yet, he couldn't deny the boy's audacity.

Dominic knew his overnight stay must have infuriated Henry beyond measure. The kid probably hadn't slept a wink, which explained this morning's cyberattack on Blackwood Group.

While Henry had every right to be angry, the image of the boy tossing and turning in rage brought an involuntary smirk to Dominic's face.

"Mr. Blackwood, should we notify the authorities?" Nathan Cross inquired, his voice laced with concern.

Descending the grand staircase, Dominic drawled, "What's the status from cybersecurity?"

"They're working round the clock to restore the system, sir."

"Estimated time?"

"Should be operational by noon," Nathan replied promptly.

Reaching the marble foyer, Dominic waved a dismissive hand. "No police."

"Understood." Nathan hesitated before adding, "Do you suspect Henry's involvement?"

"Obviously not," Dominic deadpanned.

Nathan barely suppressed his grin. "That boy's a prodigy! Our IT team fortified the firewall after his last breach, yet he still penetrated it."

"Genius or not, he's walking a dangerous path," Dominic countered sharply. "If Evelyn continues indulging his antics, he'll end up behind bars."

Nathan's amusement vanished at his boss's harsh words. Evelyn would have an aneurysm if she heard this conversation.

"Though it appears he's only targeting you... No reports of him hacking other corporations," Nathan mused. "As long as you don't press charges, prison isn't in his future."

Nathan knew Dominic would never actually send Henry to jail. No matter the provocation, Evelyn's protection shielded the boy from real consequences.

Dominic's expression darkened. "Then I can expect endless trouble ahead. That brat's skills will only sharpen with age." The thought left him unsettled, like an itch he couldn't scratch.

Meanwhile, at Mooncrest Manor...

Zoe Montgomery had been discharged prematurely from St. Elizabeth Medical Center. Though doctors recommended extended care, she couldn't bear remaining in that sterile environment.

While Dominic hadn't formally ended their relationship, everyone understood their engagement was over. Without status as his fiancée, she no longer had justification to stay in the Blackwood estate.

"Stay as long as you need, dear. Don't overthink things," Eleanor Blackwood cooed, patting Zoe's hand. "Dominic's opinions don't reflect mine. I'm still quite fond of you."

"Your kindness means everything, Eleanor. But Dominic might disapprove..." Zoe trailed off.

"Nonsense! He's not that petty." Eleanor produced an ornate velvet box. "A token of my affection. I hope you'll continue treating Sophia with your professional expertise, regardless of personal matters."

Zoe accepted the gift gracefully. Of course Eleanor remained cordial - her skills were still valuable to the Blackwoods.

"You have my word." Opening the box revealed an exquisite emerald bracelet. "This is stunning. Thank you."

"My eldest daughter-in-law coveted this piece for years," Eleanor confided with a conspiratorial smile. "That should demonstrate my regard for you."

"I harbor no ill will toward Dominic. Some things simply aren't meant to be," Zoe replied serenely.

Their conversation was interrupted when a maid whispered urgently in Eleanor's ear. The older woman's face clouded, and she hurried away without explanation.

###Chapter 369

Eleanor Blackwood picked up the phone as soon as she stepped inside. "Hello, do you know Dominic Blackwood? I'm his mother."

"Good afternoon, Mrs. Blackwood. How may I assist you?" The voice on the other end responded politely.

"There's a child named Henry Thorne enrolled at your kindergarten, correct?"

"That's correct."

"I need several strands of his hair. Name your price and I'll compensate you generously," Eleanor stated bluntly.

The person hesitated. "May I ask why you need his hair? It's not that I don't want to help, but Henry is... particular about physical contact. Only his sister Lily can touch him."

Eleanor hadn't anticipated such complications for a simple request.

"Then find another way! If you can't get hair, blood will suffice!" Eleanor's voice turned sharp. "Let me be frank - that boy's mother was briefly married to my son. I suspect there's more to his parentage. Help me with this and you'll be handsomely rewarded."

At that moment, the housekeeper noticed movement by the door and quickly stepped out.

"Ms. Montgomery, do you need something?" The housekeeper's expression darkened as she stared at Zoe, though she maintained professional composure.

Caught eavesdropping, Zoe panicked. "I... I wanted to return Mrs. Blackwood's gift. It seems too extravagant."

"Please wait in the parlor," the housekeeper instructed firmly.

Zoe retreated immediately.

When Eleanor finished her call, the housekeeper chose not to mention Zoe's eavesdropping to avoid unnecessary drama.

After some polite conversation, Zoe excused herself, claiming lunch plans with her father.

Outside the Blackwood estate, Zoe's mind raced.

From what she'd overheard, Eleanor suspected Evelyn's children. While Dominic claimed to dislike children, Eleanor desperately wanted grandchildren. If she discovered Henry and Lily were Dominic's, she'd undoubtedly embrace them - and side with Evelyn.

That couldn't happen.

At the restaurant, Zoe sat across from her father and Margaret Thorne.

"Why so glum, Zoe? Didn't Dominic give you that generous settlement? Money solves everything," Richard Montgomery remarked.

Zoe sipped her water. "It's not about the money. Margaret, did you finalize the acquisition of those tech firms you wanted?"

Margaret's eyes gleamed. "Nearly. It's the perfect time to invest. With Thornfield Industries dominating the market, smaller companies are struggling. Interested in joining? The returns will be substantial."

Zoe's interest piqued. "How can you be certain?"

"Because Evelyn is my nemesis," Margaret hissed. "And I will destroy her."

Convinced, Zoe nodded. "Consider me in."

Meanwhile, Evelyn was buried in work at Thornfield Industries when she noticed the time.

She hurried to a nearby pharmacy.

"May I help you, miss?" a clerk asked.

Blushing slightly, Evelyn murmured, "Morning-after pills, please."

The clerk handed her the package with a knowing look.

As Evelyn paid, Dominic's warning echoed in her mind - he'd vowed to keep her forever if she didn't conceive his child. Whether the child survived or not was irrelevant.

A chill ran down her spine. The package slipped from her fingers, hitting the floor with a soft thud.
###Chapter 370

Nathan Cross pushed open the heavy oak door to Dominic Blackwood's office at Blackwood Group headquarters. The network systems had just been restored after the cyberattack.

"Mr. Blackwood, the Cybersecurity Department asked me to bring you these," Nathan said, placing a thick stack of documents on the polished mahogany desk.

Dominic glanced at the papers, his piercing blue eyes narrowing slightly. "What's this?"

"I believe these are the malware codes written by Henry Thorne." Nathan quickly averted his gaze after a brief scan. He didn't dare examine the contents too closely.

Dominic flipped open the file. Hidden within the complex lines of code, a single sentence stood out: (Dominic Blackwood is a moron.)

His jaw tightened. Turning to the second page revealed another insult: (Dominic Blackwood crashes his Ferrari into a lake!)

The third page contained: (Dominic Blackwood gets locked in a bathroom stall), while the fourth page declared: (Dominic Blackwood inhales his caviar.)

With one swift motion, Dominic fed the entire stack into the industrial shredder beside his desk. Though his expression darkened, he remained silent. After all, Henry was just a four-year-old child, hardly worth his anger.

A sharp knock interrupted the tense silence before the door swung open.

Lucas Grant leaned against the doorframe, flashing his signature charming grin. "Lunch, Dominic?"

Nathan shot Lucas a warning look. The CFO immediately picked up on the atmosphere and stepped inside. "What's going on?"

Nathan moved closer and murmured, "Evelyn's son has a real talent for pissing people off."

Lucas let out an incredulous laugh. "That four-year-old prodigy? Damn, he makes our entire cybersecurity team look like amateurs!"

The observation stung. Blackwood Group only hired the best tech talent in the industry.

"Perhaps he has an exceptional teacher," Nathan suggested before quickly excusing himself, his ears turning pink.

Dominic and Lucas headed to an upscale bistro near the corporate headquarters. After placing their orders, Lucas leaned forward with a playful smirk. "So I heard about the barbecue at Evelyn's place. Why wasn't I invited?"

"Do you know why Henry Thorne hacked into our systems?" Dominic countered, ignoring the question.

"Because the kid hates your guts?"

"I showed up uninvited."

Lucas nearly choked on his mineral water. "Since when did you develop such thick skin, Dominic?"

"I wanted to understand why Evelyn was celebrating." Dominic took a measured sip of his espresso. In his experience, people only hosted barbecues for special occasions.

"Did you find out what she was so happy about?"

Dominic shook his head once. "They didn't let me in."

Lucas actually felt a pang of sympathy. "If they don't want you there, just stay away. I'll take you anywhere you want to eat."

"Their rejection doesn't affect me." Dominic set down his cup with precise control.

Watching his friend's composed demeanor, Lucas chuckled. "You can't stay away from her, can you? You broke off your engagement because of Evelyn."

"That's incorrect," Dominic corrected coolly. "The primary reason I ended the engagement was because I don't love Zoe."

"While I'm no fan of Zoe Montgomery, even I feel she got the short end this time. She lost you and the baby... Don't you feel anything about that child? It was yours, after all. Would have been born in a few months if not for the miscarriage," Lucas said with uncharacteristic solemnity.

Dominic's expression remained impassive, his voice glacial. "If I'm to have children, they won't come from another woman."

###Chapter 371

Dominic might as well have just admitted outright that he only wanted Evelyn to carry his children—that he couldn't care less if any other woman bore his child, because he never wanted them in the first place.

"So you want Evelyn to have your baby, then?" Lucas teased, swirling his whiskey.

"Exactly."

Lucas nearly choked on his drink. "You're serious? You actually want her to be the mother of your child?!"

"Zoe demanded I avenge our lost child."

Lucas arched a brow. "So your grand revenge plan is... knocking Evelyn up?" He let out a disbelieving laugh. "If Zoe finds out this is your idea of vengeance, she’ll probably faint from sheer outrage."

Dominic’s expression remained unreadable. "How I choose to settle this is my business."

"Does Evelyn even want this?" Lucas knew there had to be more to it.

Evelyn already had two children—one adopted, but Lucas could see she loved Henry as fiercely as if he were her own. It made sense she wouldn’t be eager for another.

"She doesn’t." Dominic’s jaw tightened. "She despises me now."

"Of course she does! You’re trying to force her into motherhood!"

Lucas was stunned by Dominic’s ruthlessness. Dominic had never been the gentlemanly type, but this was borderline barbaric. Evelyn hadn’t intended for Zoe to lose the baby—so why punish her like this?

Unless...

This wasn’t about revenge at all.

Dominic’s voice dropped, rough with emotion. "She has a scar. Right across her abdomen." His fingers flexed against his glass. "A reminder that she carried another man’s child. Even if he never touched her, she still gave birth to his baby. It drives me insane."

That was the real reason he wanted Evelyn pregnant. Revenge was just an excuse.

"Dominic," Lucas said slowly, "if you only want her to bear your child... it means you’re still in love with her."

Dominic scoffed, but the misery in his eyes betrayed him.

"Is this love?" he muttered bitterly. "She wants nothing to do with me."

Lucas smirked. "They say a woman falls hardest when she’s carrying a man’s baby. Maybe your plan isn’t so terrible after all."

Dominic’s gaze darkened with resolve. Right or wrong, he’d already set things in motion.

A week later, Sophie dragged Evelyn to a bridal boutique, giddy with excitement.

"Have you ever tried on a wedding dress?" Sophie asked, fingers trailing over lace and silk.

Evelyn shook her head. "Just evening gowns that vaguely resembled them."

"Wedding dresses are different," Sophie insisted. "You should try one! With your figure and complexion, you’d look breathtaking." She held up an ivory gown. "What about this one? It’s similar to the one I had custom-made!"

Evelyn’s cheeks flushed. "I don’t have a fiancé, Sophie. There’s no point."

"Just humor me!" Sophie waved off her protests and signaled the attendant. "We’ll take this one. And you—" She pointed at Evelyn. "—are trying it on."

Evelyn rolled her eyes as Sophie pushed her toward the dressing room. "What’s next? Picking out a groom so we can have a double wedding?"

Sophie grinned. "I’d love to, but no man alive is good enough for you."

Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh.

An hour later, Sophie posted a nine-photo carousel on social media—her in her dream dress, and Evelyn in the borrowed gown.

Within minutes, someone forwarded Evelyn’s photo to Dominic.

He zoomed in, his grip tightening on his phone.

"Why is she in a wedding dress?" he growled. "Who the hell is she marrying?"
###Chapter 372

The moment Dominic saw Evelyn's radiant smile in the photograph, a sharp pang shot through his chest. It had been nearly five years since she last smiled at him like that - that genuine, unguarded expression he once took for granted.

At the bridal boutique, Evelyn slipped out of the wedding gown and selected a lavender cocktail dress for Sophie's upcoming ceremony.

"I'll be hitting thirty soon," Evelyn mused, smoothing the delicate fabric. "This might be my last chance to wear dresses like these before I'm officially 'too old' for them."

"Don't be ridiculous!" Sophie scoffed, adjusting her own gown. "With that face of yours, you could pass for twenty-two. Age is just a number, darling. Wear whatever makes you happy!"

"Such silver-tongued flattery! No wonder Adrian's completely smitten with you," Evelyn teased.

"Please, he's the lucky one in this relationship," Sophie retorted with a playful wink. After admiring her reflection, she added, "Now that the dresses are sorted, all that's left is the big day! Speaking of celebrations, isn't the twins' birthday coming up? Any special plans?"

"Just a quiet evening at home."

"What? No party?" Sophie's eyebrows shot up. She'd already selected extravagant gifts for her godchildren and anticipated receiving an invitation. "Not even a small gathering?"

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "I've decided against any celebrations this year."

The unspoken reason hung between them - Dominic. Evelyn had spun an elaborate lie, claiming Lily was a test-tube baby and Henry was adopted. If Dominic discovered the twins shared a birthday, his suspicions would undoubtedly be aroused.

"This is about Dominic, isn't it?" Sophie's lips pressed into a thin line. "That man simply can't take a hint! But Evelyn, do you really think you can keep this secret forever?" She lowered her voice. "Adrian knows nothing, of course. I'm just worried Dominic might start digging eventually."

The mere thought made Evelyn's temples throb. Every attempt to distance herself from Dominic only entangled them further, as if fate delighted in mocking her efforts.

"I'll protect this secret as long as necessary! Both children despise him and refuse to acknowledge him as their father."

"And can you blame them?" Sophie linked arms with Evelyn as they exited the boutique. "Dominic's arrogance is legendary. The man wouldn't know humility if it bit him. Now, let's find somewhere decadent for lunch - my treat!"

Evelyn frowned. "Shouldn't Adrian be with you today? This seems like something he'd want to be involved in."

"He's transitioning into his family's business empire," Sophie explained with a dramatic sigh. "The workload is monstrous this year. If we want that Mediterranean honeymoon in May, I need to give him space to handle things now." She squeezed Evelyn's arm. "Honestly, I see you more than I see my own fiancé these days."

"Any plans for children? You should start prenatal vitamins if you're considering it soon," Evelyn advised.

Sophie's face clouded. "You know my phobia of pain. The idea of childbirth terrifies me, so we're holding off." She glanced around nervously. "Don't breathe a word - both our parents are desperate for grandchildren!"

This surprised Evelyn. "But you adore kids!"

"I do! I worship the ground your twins walk on, but loving children and birthing them are entirely different matters." Sophie's expression turned mischievous. "I'm holding out for scientific advancements. The moment men can carry babies, Adrian's volunteering as tribute!"

Evelyn burst into laughter, the sound drawing glances from nearby shoppers.

"Have your security bring the twins downtown after school. We'll do an early birthday dinner - just us girls." Sophie's eyes sparkled. "I'll leave Adrian out of it tonight, promise."

Evelyn smiled gratefully. "Thank you, godmother."

"It's what they deserve!" Sophie's expression darkened. "This is exactly why I loathe Dominic. Those beautiful children should have a complete family, but because of one selfish bastard..."

Evelyn's smile vanished.

"No offense, darling," Sophie backtracked quickly. "The twins are clearly happy with you. I just mean... they deserve both parents."

"None taken. You're right."

The familiar guilt settled in Evelyn's chest like a stone. She often wondered if her stubborn decision to keep the children had been fair. Given the choice, would they have chosen this life?

At precisely six o'clock, Evelyn's security detail escorted the twins to Ravenshore's most exclusive restaurant, where Sophie waited with an armful of gaily wrapped presents.

###Chapter 373

Sophie and Evelyn were seated by the window, enjoying the view outside.

"Mom!" Lily ran toward Evelyn, dragging her brother along by the hand.

Evelyn scooped them both up and settled them onto the couch. "Did you have a good day at preschool?"

Lily shook her head, her big eyes wide with worry. "Mom, the teacher said we have to get our fingers pricked next week... I don't want to!"

"It's just a blood sugar test," Henry explained matter-of-factly.

Understanding dawned on Evelyn's face, and she pulled Lily into a reassuring hug. "Sweetheart, it'll only hurt for a second. Like a tiny pinch."

Lily's gaze immediately darted to the cake on the table, her fear forgotten.

"Mom, whose birthday is it? Is it Aunt Sophie's?"

Sophie chuckled and shook her head. "We're celebrating yours and Henry's birthday early! Surprise!" She pulled out two exquisitely wrapped gifts and handed them to the children.

"Really?" Lily gasped, clutching her present with excitement. "Thank you, Aunt Sophie! I love you!"

"Love you too, sweetie," Sophie said, ruffling Lily's hair.

Evelyn nudged Henry, who reluctantly took his gift, cheeks pink. "Thanks," he mumbled.

"Go on, open them! If you don't like them, I can exchange them," Sophie encouraged, demonstrating how to untie the ribbon. "Just pull this, and—voilà!"

Within moments, the gifts were unwrapped. Lily squealed in delight at the delicate doll crafted in her likeness.

"Look, it's me! I love it!" She hugged the doll and planted a kiss on its cheek.

Henry's gift was similar—a finely made doll resembling him. He studied it quietly, neither thrilled nor disappointed.

Just then, the waiter arrived with their food. Once everything was served, Evelyn placed birthday hats on the children's heads.

"We'll keep it simple this year, but I promise to throw you a proper party when I can," Evelyn said.

"Mom, we don't need a party as long as you're here!" Lily beamed. Then her smile faltered. "I just wish Grandma was still here... She promised to bake us a chocolate cake before she..."

Evelyn's expression froze.

Sophie quickly intervened. "Who wants cake? Let's cut it!"

"We have to make a wish first, Aunt Sophie!" Lily insisted, grabbing the candles. "We need to light them and sing!"

Meanwhile, at the restaurant entrance, a tall, imposing figure stood motionless.

Dominic Blackwood's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn's familiar face before shifting to the children—Lily and Henry.

Noticing the birthday hats, realization struck him. Today's their birthday?

"Mr. Blackwood, your table is ready," his associate said respectfully.

Ignoring the man, Dominic strode purposefully toward Evelyn. Confused, his entourage trailed behind, unsure of what was happening.

###Chapter 374

When Dominic appeared by the table, Evelyn was about to take a bite of the cake.

The plastic fork nearly snapped in her grip at the sight of him.

Of all the restaurants in Ravenshore, why did he have to walk into this one?

Sophie frowned. "What a coincidence, Mr. Blackwood. Business meeting?"

She waved sarcastically at the group behind him. The men returned polite but cautious smiles.

Dominic glanced at the cake, then at the children. "Birthday?" His voice was deep, commanding, and laced with confusion.

He remembered Henry’s birthday was April 13th. Not today.

Evelyn’s blood turned to ice. She hadn’t wanted to celebrate openly for this exact reason. Yet here he was, catching them mid-celebration.

Dominic studied the panic flashing across Evelyn’s face.

"So Henry’s birthday isn’t April 13th? And Lily’s is today too?" His gaze sharpened. "Two children, same birthday. Unless—"

"Got nothing better to do?" Sophie snatched the party hats off Lily and Henry’s heads and plopped them onto herself and Evelyn. "Today’s our friendship anniversary. We’re celebrating. Got a problem with that?"

Evelyn’s panic dissolved instantly.

Dominic’s eyes locked onto Evelyn. "Eager to remarry?"

Her breath hitched. Before she could respond, Sophie cut in. "Mind your own business, Dominic. Even if she does remarry, it won’t be you. Give it up."

Dominic’s expression darkened. "Sophie Mercer, I wasn’t speaking to you."

Evelyn stepped in. "She said exactly what I would’ve. Yelling in public? Very unprofessional."

She emphasized public, and Dominic visibly reined in his temper.

Jaw clenched, he turned and strode away.

Once he was gone, Sophie exhaled. "Damn, that was intense. Never seen him that pissed at me before."

"Don’t provoke him next time. Adrian’s stuck in the middle."

Sophie rolled her eyes. "Why’s he so obsessed? You’re divorced. Then he asks if you want to remarry? What, is he offering?"

Evelyn sighed. "Let’s just avoid upscale places from now on."

"We’re not the ones who should be hiding!"

Evelyn’s chest tightened.

She was hiding. Her children were her weakness. If it came down to it, she’d give Dominic a child—but never Henry and Lily.

"Mommy, why did he ask about marriage?" Lily piped up.

Sophie burst out laughing. "Your mom tried on a wedding dress today. Stunning. Bet Dominic saw the photo and lost his mind."

Evelyn flushed. "Sophie, no more posting me online."

"He’s not on my socials. Probably Adrian or Nathan sent it. Men gossip worse than we do."

As Evelyn peeled shrimp for the kids, her phone lit up.

Dominic’s name flashed on the screen.

She removed her gloves and unlocked it.

A single message:
Oceanview Grand Hotel. Room 906.

###Chapter 375

The text was blunt. It demanded her presence.

Evelyn frowned and typed back, [Not tonight.]

Dominic responded instantly, his fury practically radiating through the screen as she read his reply.

[This isn’t a request. It’s an order.]

Her fingers trembled slightly as she stared at the words, then fired back.

[Have you forgotten women have cycles? Or do you intend to ignore that little detail?]

[Still interested?]

His next message came swiftly. [Are you testing me?]

Evelyn didn’t dare answer. She wasn’t foolish enough to provoke him further. The thought of him insisting despite everything sent a chill down her spine.

Upstairs in the restaurant, Dominic set his phone down when she didn’t respond.

The table had fallen silent while he was texting. Only when his phone hit the tablecloth did conversation cautiously resume.

"Mr. Blackwood, that woman downstairs—she’s the CEO of Thornfield Industries, isn’t she?"

"That’s her. A quick search pulls up her photos." The man beside him flashed his phone screen, displaying Evelyn’s professional headshot. "You all remember Margaret Thorne, right? She used to be Evelyn’s stepmother. After Richard Thorne’s death, they clashed over the inheritance. Now Margaret’s back in the country, investing in drones. Looks like she’s gunning for Evelyn’s downfall."

"Who do you think will come out on top?"

"Hard to say. Both deal in drones, but their markets are different. Evelyn caters to high-end clients, while Margaret’s targeting the budget crowd. If Margaret wins, she’ll rake in more profit."

"I’m betting on Margaret. She’s got a solid track record overseas. Clearly knows what she’s doing. Mr. Blackwood, what’s your take?"

All eyes turned to Dominic.

He tapped his phone screen, but Evelyn still hadn’t replied.

"Are you all planning to invest with Margaret Thorne?" Dominic’s gaze sharpened, his voice dangerously smooth. "I have no stake in either of them. Their business doesn’t concern me."

"Ah… I haven’t committed yet, but I’m considering it. Just wanted your opinion, Mr. Blackwood."

The casual mask slipped from Dominic’s face. "A truly competent businesswoman wouldn’t need to beg for investments from acquaintances. Decide for yourself what to do with your money."

He ended dinner early.

When he reached the first floor, his eyes flicked to Evelyn’s table—empty.

Had she really rushed off just to avoid him?

Time passed quickly, and soon it was Monday—the day of Mooncrest Academy’s health check-up.

A sleek black car waited under the shade of a tree in the parking lot. Inside, Eleanor Blackwood fidgeted nervously.

The blood test was a ruse. The real goal was securing a sample from Henry.

Eleanor worried he wouldn’t cooperate. If he refused, they couldn’t force him. And then everything would become far more complicated.

Nearly an hour later, a nurse hurried toward the car.

Eleanor’s lips curved into a smile.

Had it worked?

###Chapter 376

The nurse approached the sleek black sedan and handed a small vial of blood to Eleanor Blackwood.

"Everything went smoothly?" Eleanor's fingers trembled slightly as she took the vial, her lips curling into a satisfied smile.

The nurse nodded. "His sister was terrified of needles, so he volunteered to go first to show her it wasn't so bad. Such a sweet bond between siblings."

Eleanor barely registered the comment. Her focus was solely on Henry Thorne. The boy bore no resemblance to Dominic Blackwood, and rumors had long circulated that Lily was Evelyn's child with another man.

Even if Henry turned out to be Dominic's son, Eleanor had no intention of welcoming Evelyn into the family. How would society perceive Dominic if he took back a woman who had borne another man's child?

She carefully tucked the vial into her purse and shut the car door with a decisive click.

The vehicle glided toward the prestigious DNA testing center. Upon arrival, Eleanor handed over the blood samples—Dominic's and Henry's—to the waiting technician.

"How long until we get the results?"

"Typically three business days. We'll notify you immediately once they're ready," the technician assured her.

Eleanor's pulse quickened with anticipation, though she maintained her composed facade with a curt nod.

Meanwhile, at Thornfield Industries, the weekly executive meeting was underway.

"President Thorne, Margaret Thorne is making aggressive moves," the vice-president reported, tension lining his voice. "She's acquired three companies in one fell swoop and already begun restructuring. But the real shocker? She's secured one point five billion in funding. Investors are betting heavily on her."

A colleague chimed in, "A contact at her firm says Margaret's ambitions are sky-high. She plans to dominate the drone market by undercutting prices, then pivot to luxury models once she's captured the customer base. Her endgame? Pushing us out entirely."

Michael Sterling scoffed. "Let her try. We'll see who crumbles first."

"President Thorne, your thoughts?" The vice-president turned to Evelyn. "Our product quality is unmatched, but we should still prepare countermeasures."

Evelyn sipped her coffee thoughtfully. "We'll monitor her next move. Slashing prices means heavy marketing spend. She might gain customers quickly, but profitability? That's where she'll stumble."

Michael smirked. "One wrong step, and she'll be left with nothing but empty pockets and broken dreams."

Laughter rippled through the room.

Evelyn set her cup down. "Is the one point five billion figure confirmed?"

"Announced at her investor meeting. Even if inflated, she's definitely secured at least a billion."

Evelyn's gaze swept the table. "Are our drones overpriced?"

"Not for their caliber. But for the average Eldermere citizen earning a few thousand a month, spending thousands on a drone is a stretch."

Evelyn nodded. "We stay the course. Unless she develops AI surpassing ours, she can't touch us. Focus on innovation, not panic."

The team visibly relaxed.

Still, Margaret amassing such capital so quickly was unsettling.

After the meeting, the vice-president lingered. "President Thorne... I heard Dominic Blackwood invested heavily in Margaret's venture. That's likely how she raised funds so fast."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her tablet. She fought to keep her voice steady. "If Dominic sees potential, it's just business. We're past personal entanglements."

"But at your expense? He's practically bankrolling your downfall!"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Dominic didn't get where he is by playing it safe. Even without him, others would fund her. We'll face this head-on."

Her tone was ice, but her chest burned.

She strode to her office, the weight of unspoken words pressing down with every step.

###Chapter 377 

The gilded invitation lay perfectly centered on the polished mahogany desk.

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly as she broke the wax seal and unfolded the thick parchment.

An exclusive summit invitation from the International Business Consortium.

Michael appeared at her office door just as she finished reading. "You don't have to attend if—" "I'm going," she interrupted, reaching for her clutch.

She pulled out a tube of crimson lipstick and carefully applied it before the antique mirror.

Michael's eyebrows shot up. "Someone's feeling feisty today. That shade is... bold. You usually prefer those soft pinks that make you look like some delicate flower."

He stepped closer, admiring her transformation. "But this? This makes you look like you could conquer nations. Victoria wouldn't stand a chance even with an army behind her."

Evelyn snapped her compact shut and turned to face him. "Are you coming with me or not?"

"Wouldn't miss it for the world. I'll drive."

The grand ballroom overflowed with industry titans and political elites when they arrived. Before Evelyn could take three steps inside, a staff member whisked her backstage.

"Miss Thorne, we need you to deliver the opening keynote. Twenty minutes. Do you have prepared remarks?"

She nodded automatically, then realized Michael had vanished into the crowd.

No prepared speech. No notes. Just thirty minutes until showtime.

Stepping through the velvet curtains, Evelyn gasped at the sea of faces stretching to the horizon. She fumbled for her phone when suddenly—iron fingers clamped around her wrist.

Her pulse skyrocketed as she whirled to face her captor.

Dominic's personal security detail. Which meant...

Her gaze darted across the room where Michael and Nathan stood nose-to-nose near the champagne fountain. If Nathan was here...

"Release me!" She wrenched her arm free, glaring daggers at the bodyguard. "I know how to walk, thank you very much."

The stone-faced man stepped back. "No funny business."

"Where is he?" Her breath came in shallow gasps as adrenaline flooded her veins.

The summit would begin in thirty minutes. This was no coincidence—Dominic had orchestrated this.

Silent as a shadow, the bodyguard led her through a maze of corridors to a private suite. The door clicked open.

She squared her shoulders and entered.

The slam of the door behind her echoed like a gunshot.

"What do you want?" Her clutch creaked under her white-knuckled grip as she faced the man lounging on the divan.

Dominic's predatory gaze traveled slowly from her stilettos to her freshly painted lips. "Finished with your little monthly inconvenience, I presume?"

"I have a speech to deliver." Her heel caught on the plush carpet as she retreated toward the door. "If this is about sex, come back tonight."

In one fluid motion, he crossed the room and captured her chin between his fingers. "I'm tired of nighttime," his gravelly voice sent shivers down her spine. "Let's try something new... daylight suits you far better."
###Chapter 378

At the summit's VIP lounge, Michael Sterling and Nathan Cross had been locked in a heated debate for nearly half an hour, both men visibly drained from the exchange.

"You're being completely irrational!" Nathan adjusted his designer glasses with an irritated flick of his wrist.

Michael let out a derisive laugh. "You lose all objectivity whenever Dominic Blackwood is mentioned. Maybe you should examine why you're so obsessed with your boss? He's not your father, for God's sake!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "That's rich coming from you! Since when do you care who Mr. Blackwood invests in? If he chose to fund Margaret Thorne's company, it's because she brings value to the table. Not everything is personal!"

"Consider our drinks canceled from now on!" Michael snapped, his voice cutting through the lounge. "If you're siding with Margaret Thorne, then we have nothing more to discuss. My loyalty lies with Evelyn!"

Nathan's face flushed crimson. "Fine! Who needs your friendship anyway?"

The two men stormed off in opposite directions to locate their respective bosses.

Ten minutes later, a panicked Michael circled back. "I can't find Evelyn anywhere! Where's Dominic?"

Nathan shrugged, checking his watch. "No idea. He didn't share his schedule. We came for the summit, obviously."

"Evelyn was supposed to deliver a keynote speech!" Michael frantically dialed her number, only to get her voicemail. "Her phone's off. This isn't like her."

Nathan smirked. "You really think Mr. Blackwood would attend as just another audience member? If they're both missing..."

"Of course I know they're together!" Michael exploded. "That bastard Dominic must have kidnapped her!"

"Must you always be so vulgar?" Nathan shot back. "Relax. Mr. Blackwood is meticulous about time. He'll be back before—"

Michael took several deep breaths, forcing himself to wait.

Thirty minutes later, with the summit already twenty minutes behind schedule, there was still no sign of either Dominic or Evelyn.

Were they not in such a public setting, Michael might have grabbed Nathan by his expensive tie to demand what exactly he meant by Dominic being "meticulous about time."

Their attention snapped to the stage as applause erupted. Margaret Thorne ascended the podium with practiced grace, her smile radiating confidence as she bowed to the audience.

"It's an honor to address such distinguished entrepreneurs today," Margaret began, her voice smooth as silk. "At Wonder Technology, we believe innovation should transform lives at every socioeconomic level—not just the privileged few."

As Margaret launched into her polished speech, Michael made a snap decision. He marched toward the event coordinator, determined to represent Evelyn's company himself.

He wouldn't let Margaret steal this moment.

Meanwhile, in the Oceanview Grand Hotel's presidential suite...

Evelyn had attempted three times to rise from the bed, only to be pinned back down each time by Dominic's muscular frame. The thin satin sheet between them did little to preserve her modesty.

"Why is he being so insufferable?" she fumed silently. "Does he enjoy sabotaging my professional commitments?"

"These events are exhausting," Dominic murmured against the delicate skin of her neck, his warm breath sending shivers down her spine. "Aren't you tired?"

She shoved his head away. "I'd be less tired if you weren't crushing me into this mattress!"

Dominic finally relented at her labored breathing, rolling onto his side to admire her flushed cheeks. "Let's have dinner."

"Our arrangement begins and ends in bed," Evelyn retorted, scrambling up. "We're not close enough for shared meals."

"You're already late," Dominic countered coldly, watching as she gathered her scattered clothing. "Rushing now won't help."

"I'd rather go stare at the sun than spend another minute here." She dressed with deliberate slowness, each garment a silent protest.

Dominic's mood darkened instantly. They dressed in tense silence on opposite sides of the lavish bed.

As Evelyn fastened her watch, she hesitated before voicing the question burning in her mind. "Dominic... did you really invest in Margaret's company?"

He finished adjusting his cufflinks and met her gaze with narrowed eyes. "I thought our relationship was strictly physical? We're not in bed anymore."
###Chapter 379

Evelyn pressed her lips into a thin line and marched toward the exit.

"I'm not sure if this counts as investing in Thornfield Industries," Dominic's lazy drawl stopped her when her hand was on the doorknob, "but I transferred three hundred million to Zoe Montgomery."

"Three hundred million? He gave Zoe three hundred million?!" The numbers exploded in Evelyn's mind like fireworks.

"Wasn't it one hundred fifty-five million?" The question slipped out before she could stop it.

A dark chuckle rumbled from behind her. "So you've been keeping tabs on my transactions with Zoe. Yes, I gave her one fifty-five initially. Then another one fifty-five the day before yesterday." His voice turned clinical. "She performed two surgeries on Sophia. Seventy-five million per procedure."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. Because of those operations, Zoe had extorted an obscene fortune from Dominic. And every cent had gone straight to Margaret.

"How poetic! This is the cruelest joke fate's ever played on me. I'm the one who actually performed those surgeries! Which means I just handed Margaret three hundred million! That woman deserves to rot in hell!" The hysterical laughter bubbled up her throat.

Dominic noticed her rigid posture, the barely perceptible tremors wracking her frame.

He dressed with military precision and closed the distance between them. When he grasped her shoulder, her ashen complexion and hollow eyes sent a jolt through him.

"Evelyn, what's wrong?" His fingers circled her wrist like a manacle.

She inhaled sharply before wrenching free.

"I'm the punchline of this cosmic joke, Dominic Blackwood!" Her chin lifted defiantly as she battled the tears scalding her eyes. "Mercy was my mistake. I won't make it again—not with you, not with anyone in your orbit!"

Her VP had been right. Every dollar Dominic gave Zoe was another dagger in her back because Zoe and Margaret were partners in crime.

The realization that she'd betrayed both herself and her mother carved fresh wounds in her chest.

"What the hell are you talking about?" Dominic seized her wrist again, his scowl deepening. "Are you jealous about the money? Or do you think Zoe's overcharging?"

"Give her your entire fortune for all I care!" she shrieked.

"Ah, so that's it." His lips twisted into a mocking smile. "If you could cure Sophia, I'd pay you whatever you demanded! But can you? Can you heal my sister?"

His voice cracked like a whip.

"No! And I wouldn't if I could!" The words tasted like ash, but Evelyn forced them out. "I'd watch her suffer before lifting a finger to help!"

The venom in her voice made him recoil. He released her arm as if burned. It stung, knowing Evelyn neither wanted him nor his money.

Evelyn fled the suffocating room. She bypassed the event entirely, hailing a cab outside the Oceanview Grand. The driver nodded when she rattled off her home address.

In her current state, she'd only make a scene. Solitude was the only remedy.

By evening, the children's voices floated from the foyer as they returned from Mooncrest Academy.

"Mommy! You're home early!" Lily bounded toward her while Henry followed at a more sedate pace. Lily thrust out her index finger dramatically. "They took our blood today and it huuuurts!"

The tiny finger showed no visible mark when Evelyn inspected it.

Blowing gently on the imaginary wound, Evelyn murmured, "Mommy's magic breath will make it better."

"Henry got poked too!" Lily grabbed her brother's hand and presented it like evidence.

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "I thought you didn't like being touched?"
###Chapter 380

"Mommy, the nurse let Henry go first because I was scared of the needle," Lily explained with wide, innocent eyes. "He wanted to show me it wouldn't hurt. Henry did this just for me! He loves me so much!"

Evelyn's heart swelled as she listened to her daughter's words. She pulled both children into a warm embrace. "My sweet angels, you make Mommy prouder every single day with your kindness."

"Mom, we love you too!" Lily giggled, her joyful expression mirroring her brother's.

Their bodyguard shifted awkwardly nearby before clearing his throat. "Miss Thorne, shall I prepare dinner tonight?"

Evelyn hesitated. "Wouldn't that be too much trouble?"

"Not at all," he assured her, already moving toward the kitchen.

Lily tugged at Evelyn's sleeve excitedly. "Uncle makes the best spicy wings! He promised them for tonight." Her expression suddenly turned curious. "Why didn't Uncle Michael come home with you?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched involuntarily. "He had... other business to attend to."

Dominic had turned off her phone again. She could only imagine Michael's panic when he couldn't reach her. Quickly retrieving her phone from her purse, she powered it on and immediately returned Michael's missed calls.

"Avery— I mean, Evelyn!" Michael's frantic voice came through the line. "For heaven's sake, warn me next time Dominic whisks you away! Do you have any idea how worried I was?"

Heat rose to Evelyn's cheeks. "About that fight with Nathan earlier—"

"You saw that?" Michael huffed. "I simply asked if Dominic invested in Margaret's company. That stone-faced assistant of his told me to mind my own business! Said his boss knows what he's doing whether he funds Wonder Tech or not. That arrogant tone—"

"Was it really worth arguing about?" Evelyn glanced toward the kitchen. "Are you coming home for dinner?"

"Got plans already," Michael deflected. "Shame you missed Margaret's speech today though. Claimed she founded her company purely to help the poor!" His mocking laughter echoed through the phone. "As if anyone believes that. Might as well tattoo 'I want money' on her forehead!"

Evelyn listened calmly to Michael's rant. Since returning home, she'd come to a realization. She couldn't control Margaret's actions—only strengthen her own company. When the time came, she'd be ready to strike decisively.

"Don't drink too much tonight," she cautioned. "And call a cab if you do. I've got a headache and won't be able to pick you up."

"Headache? Is it Margaret or Dominic causing trouble again?" Concern laced Michael's voice.

"Neither. Just my own thoughts." She kept her tone light. "I should get back to the children."

"I'll come home early tonight," Michael promised before ending the call.

At precisely eight o'clock, a sleek black Rolls-Royce glided into Mooncrest Manor's driveway. Dominic emerged, his tailored suit accentuating his imposing frame.

Zoe Montgomery waited in the foyer, her posture composed. "Dominic, I came to check on Sophia's progress," she said smoothly. "Her recovery is remarkable, as you've surely noticed. Also, I'll be vacating the Montgomery estate in a few days."

"You're welcome to stay," Dominic offered.

Zoe shook her head firmly. "It wouldn't be proper. I'll find an apartment nearby to continue Sophia's treatments." She added pointedly, "Somewhere appropriate where I won't overstay my welcome."

Dominic studied her with newfound interest. Zoe's determination reminded him sharply of Evelyn—that same unyielding resolve when she'd ended their relationship. The memory sent a chill through him, his expression hardening imperceptibly.

###Chapter 381

Zoe Montgomery stepped out of Dominic Blackwood's grand estate, the evening air cool against her skin as she made her way back to the old Blackwood mansion.

Eleanor Blackwood had retired early, as was her habit. Gregory and his wife, Beatrice, were rarely home before midnight, and Julian—well, Julian was either out all night or holed up in his room for days. The mansion was eerily silent, as if holding its breath.

When Zoe reached her room, she pulled out her phone and sent Julian a quick message.

He appeared at her door moments later, his expression unreadable.

"Zoe," Julian said coldly, lingering in the doorway. "Our child is gone. What could you possibly want from me now?" The bitterness in his voice was sharp, a wound that hadn’t healed. He had wanted that child, despite everything.

"Do you think I didn’t want my own baby?" Zoe hissed, grabbing his wrist and yanking him inside before shutting the door behind them. "That was my flesh and blood too! But I couldn’t keep it—don’t you understand? If that child had been born, it would have ruined everything for us!"

Julian exhaled sharply, some of the tension leaving his shoulders. "Then why call me here?"

"I’m leaving," she said, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Consider this my goodbye."

Julian scoffed. "Don’t act like we won’t see each other again. You still agreed to treat Sophia, didn’t you? And you took three hundred million from my uncle."

A slow, knowing smile curled Zoe’s lips. "Julian, once I have enough money… maybe I won’t need to rely on your family’s influence anymore. But if you play your cards right…" She trailed off, her fingers tracing the line of his jaw.

His breath hitched. "Dr. Montgomery… what exactly are you suggesting?"

"Exactly what you think I am." With a sharp tug on his collar, she pulled him toward the bed and flicked off the lights.

Two days later, the phone rang at the Blackwood mansion.

Eleanor Blackwood had been waiting for this call—the paternity test results were ready. Just the thought of it sent her pulse racing. She had planned to retrieve them herself, but a sudden wave of dizziness forced her to sit down.

After taking her medication, she ordered the driver to collect the results in her stead.

As soon as he left, Eleanor couldn’t contain her excitement. She turned to the servants, her eyes gleaming.

"I refused to let them tell me over the phone," she declared, her voice trembling with anticipation. "I want to see the results with my own eyes! I had a dream last night—a wonderful dream! It was exactly the outcome I wanted!"

The servants exchanged glances but humored her with polite laughter.

At that moment, Julian descended the stairs, rubbing sleep from his eyes. "Grandmother, what’s all the commotion? You look like you’ve just won the lottery."

Eleanor beamed. "Oh, it’s far better than that! But I won’t spoil the surprise just yet. You’ll find out soon enough!"

Julian rolled his eyes. "Fine, keep your secrets. Wake me when the big reveal happens."

An hour later, the driver returned, clutching a sealed envelope.

Eleanor’s hands shook as she tore it open. But just as she pulled out the document, she realized—her reading glasses were upstairs.

With a frustrated huff, she hurried back to her room, her heart pounding.

Once the glasses were perched on her nose, she scanned the results—and her breath caught.

A slow, triumphant smile spread across her face.

"I have a grandson," she whispered to herself. "Dominic has an heir. Henry is his son. Of course he is—he looks just like Dominic did at that age! How could he not be? Evelyn hid this from us all this time!"

Her fingers trembled as she snatched up her phone, scrolling through her contacts with frantic urgency.

Then she dialed.

###Chapter 382

Half an hour later, Dominic’s phone rang. It was his brother, Gregory.

"Dominic! Get to the hospital now! Mother collapsed! It's bad!"

Dominic’s grip on his phone tightened. Without a word, he strode out of his office, his expression darkening with every step.

Nathan, his assistant, noticed the shift immediately. Something was wrong.

"Mr. Blackwood, should I reschedule your meetings?"

"Let Lucas handle them. Send me the notes," Dominic snapped before stepping into his private elevator.

The doors slid shut, sealing him in silence.

Nathan’s stomach twisted. Dominic never looked like that—not unless something catastrophic had happened.

At St. Elizabeth Medical Center, Eleanor Blackwood had already been rushed into the emergency room. When Dominic arrived, the doors remained firmly closed.

"What happened?" His voice was ice, his gaze locked onto Gregory.

"I wasn’t home. Julian said he heard Mother scream. When he ran out, he saw her tumbling down the stairs."

Dominic’s jaw clenched. "The upper floor? What was she doing up there?"

Eleanor was getting older. She rarely ventured beyond the ground floor these days.

Gregory’s face twisted with anguish. "I don’t know! I wasn’t there! You know how restless she is—always moving around the house."

"And the nurse?" Dominic’s voice sharpened. "Wasn’t she watching her?"

Eleanor had high blood pressure. A fall like that could be fatal.

"I came straight here when Julian called. I didn’t have time to interrogate anyone!" Gregory’s eyes were red-rimmed. He turned to his son. "Julian, tell your uncle what you saw."

Julian’s eyes were swollen, his face pale.

"Uncle Dominic, I was asleep. When I heard Grandma scream, I ran out and saw her on the floor. The nurse was hysterical—just crying. I barely had time to ask anything before calling the ambulance."

His fists were clenched so tightly his knuckles whitened.

Julian wiped at his eyes roughly. "I’ll go back and find out what happened."

As Julian left, Gregory paced outside the emergency room, his anxiety palpable. Dominic stood rigid on the other side, his body tense, his heart cold.

Memories flashed—the last time he’d seen his mother. It was after Zoe had lost the baby. They’d spoken briefly then. He’d promised to find another specialist for Sophia.

Eleanor had been relieved. She’d told him she wouldn’t force him and Zoe together anymore. That was her way—stern, but always yielding to him in the end.

Dominic had never been good with words. He rarely told her how much she meant to him. But that didn’t mean he didn’t love her.

She had been the one person who never failed him. And now—

A wave of dread crashed over him, suffocating, relentless.

The emergency room doors finally opened. The doctor stepped out, his expression grim.

"We lost her half an hour ago. We did everything we could. I’m sorry."

Gregory’s wife broke into sobs, her cries echoing through the sterile hallway.

Dominic walked into the emergency room, his steps heavy.

Eleanor lay there, pale, her eyes still open—wide with something unspoken.

He reached out, trying to close them, but they wouldn’t shut.

Grasping her cold hand, he swallowed hard. His voice was raw.

"Mother... what were you trying to tell me?"

Silence.

###Chapter 383 

"If there is another lifetime, I pray you never encounter Sophia or me again. We've brought you nothing but pain."

Silence remained.

Death erased everything. Memories, grudges, desires, and attachments all dissolved when the heart ceased beating.

No one would pressure him about marriage or children anymore. No one would care if he ate properly, stayed warm, or worked too hard.

Moments later, Julian burst into the hospital ward.

Learning of his grandmother's passing shattered him completely. Sobs wracked his body.

"Grandma can't be gone! Just yesterday she was lecturing me about finding a girlfriend!" Julian cried uncontrollably.

He handed Evelyn's phone to Dominic.

"The caretaker said Grandma was on a call before her fall. I brought her phone."

Dominic accepted the device with bloodshot eyes. He unlocked it and checked the call log.

A familiar name flashed on screen, striking him like a physical blow.

Evelyn Thorne!

His mother's last conversation had been with Evelyn Thorne. Why would Eleanor contact Evelyn? The call duration showed five minutes.

What could they possibly have discussed for five entire minutes?

"Who was Mother speaking with?" Gregory noticed Dominic's reaction and approached. His eyes widened at the screen. "Evelyn? Why would Mother call her? They never interacted! Mother never mentioned Evelyn!"

Dominic's hands shook as he redialed from Eleanor's phone.

At Thornfield Industries, Evelyn sat frozen in her office, consumed by dread for over an hour.

Eleanor had called earlier, revealing she knew Henry was Dominic's biological son.

Before Evelyn could respond, Eleanor recited paternity test results.

Then came the mocking.

Eleanor praised Evelyn's deception skills but vowed Dominic would claim Henry while rejecting Evelyn. She threatened legal action if Evelyn resisted.

The paternity test revelation stunned Evelyn. If Dominic knew... She couldn't fathom losing her children.

Her ringing phone startled her. Seeing Eleanor's number again, she answered with hysterical fury, "What more do you want? What the hell else could you possibly want?"

Dominic heard the venom in Evelyn's voice. What had transpired between her and his mother?

"Evelyn." His voice cracked as he spoke her name.

Hearing Dominic, Evelyn's fingers clenched until nails pierced her palms unnoticed.

Dominic using Eleanor's phone could mean only one thing. The truth was out.

Evelyn felt like a condemned criminal awaiting sentencing. The thought of losing Henry crushed her chest, stealing her breath between wrenching sobs.

"Evelyn." Dominic's tone turned icy. "What happened between you and my mother?"
###Chapter 384

Dominic's question made Evelyn's brows knit together in confusion.

What was he implying? He was interrogating her about his mother's passing?

How bizarre! Why wouldn't he simply ask Eleanor herself?

Even more perplexing was Eleanor's silence - over an hour had elapsed since their conversation. Why hadn't she revealed the truth to him yet?

Evelyn lifted her water glass with trembling fingers, taking a deliberate sip to steady herself.

"Why don't you ask your mother directly?" As the words left her lips, suspicion crept into Evelyn's mind.

Something was terribly wrong. Eleanor wouldn't have kept silent unless...

"My mother is dead." Dominic's voice was thick with grief, each word dripping with barely contained anguish. "You were the last person she spoke to. I need to know what you discussed."

The glass slipped from Evelyn's grasp, clattering against the table. A wave of dizziness washed over her.

"Eleanor's gone? How?" Her voice came out in a whisper.

"Answer me!" Dominic's patience shattered like broken glass. What he'd initially believed to be a tragic accident now seemed shrouded in mystery.

His mother had lived in that apartment for decades without incident. Why would she suddenly fall? Had something - or someone - provoked her?

That final five-minute call to Evelyn of all people... The timing was too coincidental. Too suspicious.

Evelyn's cheeks burned under his accusatory stare.

She'd feared Eleanor might reveal her secret, but never imagined this outcome. While she bore no responsibility for the woman's death, Dominic's tone made it clear where he placed the blame.

An icy realization settled in Evelyn's chest - suspicion could poison even the deepest bonds.

She'd kept her children's existence hidden precisely because she didn't trust him. Didn't believe him capable of being the father they deserved.

His current behavior only confirmed her fears - controlling, volatile, and utterly self-absorbed.

"My conversation with your mother was private!" Evelyn ground out between clenched teeth. "I had nothing to do with her death!"

Dominic's expression darkened with bitter disappointment.

"Your defensiveness speaks volumes," he rasped, voice raw with grief. "My mother's death clearly involves you."

While he mourned, she stood there guarded and evasive, every word like salt in his wounds.

All he wanted was to know his mother's final words. Was that truly so unreasonable?

No - what was unreasonable was her callous refusal.

"You've already convicted me in your mind!" Evelyn's temples throbbed with building pressure. "Nothing I say matters! If you need a scapegoat for your grief, then yes, I killed your mother!"

She drew a shuddering breath before continuing, each syllable precise and cutting. "Dominic. The love I once felt for you has turned to ashes. I'll never hope for anything from you again! I'll carry the weight of your false accusation until my dying day!"

The words poured out in a torrent. She couldn't fathom his pain - her own anguish eclipsed everything.

That very morning, Eleanor had reveled in her suffering. Now Dominic stood here accusing her of murder.

The irony was almost laughable.

Evelyn's declaration turned Dominic's heart to stone. If hatred was all she could offer, then mercy had no place between them.

"Bring Evelyn to me," he commanded the waiting bodyguard, his voice colder than winter frost.

###Chapter 385

The phone trembled in Evelyn's hand as Dominic's cold voice sliced through the line. A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Don't bother sending your bodyguard."

Her fingers tightened around the device. "Where are you? I'll come to you."

Dominic stood motionless in the hospital corridor, Eleanor's phone clenched in his fist. His knuckles whitened, veins bulging along his temples. Every muscle in his body was rigid with barely contained fury.

He had already made up his mind—Evelyn would tell him every word his mother had spoken in that final call. He wouldn't let Eleanor die without answers.

Gregory approached cautiously, his voice low. "Dominic, Mother is gone. Should we begin funeral arrangements?"

Dominic's voice was a whip crack. "Get an autopsy first."

He needed to rule out murder.

Eleanor had high blood pressure, but her recent checkup had shown stable health. A sudden fall? Too convenient.

Gregory nodded. "I'll speak with the doctors."

Nearby, Julian clung to his mother, barely daring to breathe. His pulse hammered in his throat, sweat slicking his palms.

He had to stay calm.

If Dominic ever discovered it was him who had shoved Eleanor down those stairs, he'd be dead before he could blink.

Julian hadn't wanted to do it. Eleanor had loved him, even if Dominic was her favorite. But Zoe had twisted his mind, whispering poison in his ear.

There was no turning back now.

Zoe couldn't risk Dominic finding out Evelyn's children were his. If he knew, he'd never let her go. And if Evelyn had Dominic's protection, Wanda—no, Margaret—would never stand a chance.

Zoe and Margaret were bound by their hatred. What hurt one, hurt the other.

After silencing Eleanor, Julian had burned the paternity test.

Then he'd threatened every witness—one word, and they'd join Eleanor in the grave.

The Blackwood staff obeyed without question. Fear kept them silent.

And with Eleanor's last call to Evelyn? All blame would fall where it belonged.

Evelyn and Zoe met in the hospital lobby.

Zoe's eyes lit up like a predator spotting wounded prey. A smirk curled her lips. "Evelyn. What a surprise." She pressed the elevator button, her tone dripping with mock concern. "You look terrible. Something wrong?"

The doors slid open. They stepped inside, the space empty except for them.

Evelyn ignored her.

Zoe wasn't deterred. "Here to see Aunt Eleanor? I heard she called you right before she died." Her grin widened. "What did you say to her, Evelyn? Must have been quite the conversation."

"Shut your mouth," Evelyn hissed.

Zoe laughed, delighted. "Oh, but this is too good. Seeing you suffer makes everything worth it." She leaned in, her voice a venomous whisper. "Here's a secret—Eleanor didn't fall."

Evelyn's blood turned to ice.

"She found out your children are Dominic's. Had the test results in her hands. Was seconds from telling him." Zoe's smile twisted. "Stupid old woman. Thought she was so clever. So I sent her straight to hell."

Evelyn's chest constricted.

"You know why I'm telling you this?" Zoe pressed closer, her breath hot against Evelyn's ear. "Because Dominic will never believe you."

###Chapter 386

Evelyn felt nothing when she heard Zoe's confession. She was Dominic's enemy. She had never entertained the illusion that Dominic might believe her.

"Miss Montgomery. Your breath is atrocious. Has no one had the decency to tell you?" Evelyn raised her hand to cover her nose.

Zoe's expression twisted into something venomous. She wanted to scream at Evelyn, but she didn't dare open her mouth!

With a soft ding, the elevator halted. The doors slid open slowly.

Evelyn was the first to step out. Dominic stood nearby, his eyes lighting up the moment he saw her.

He strode toward her with purpose. Without hesitation, he grabbed Evelyn's arm and dragged her around the corner.

Zoe watched them pass by, rooted to the spot, her gaze locked on Evelyn.

She saw Evelyn shake off Dominic's grip. Then, she heard Evelyn's sharp words: "Your mother was the one who called me. What we discussed had nothing to do with you! Why aren't you investigating her death? Is harassing me your only solution?"

How bold! Zoe had never imagined Evelyn would dare speak to Dominic like that. Their exchange in the elevator had been civil by comparison.

Dominic's back was turned to Zoe, but she could see his posture stiffen.

"I'm not asking about my mother's death! I want to know what she told you! What did you two talk about in those five minutes? Evelyn, you know exactly what I'm asking—stop playing dumb!"

Evelyn scoffed. "Your mother is dead, and you don't even care how it happened? If you were my son, I'd be disgusted."

"What the hell are you saying?" Dominic snapped.

"Me? Illogical? Look at yourself!" Evelyn's eyes burned with fury. She finally spat it out. "Your mother didn't fall. She was pushed."

Dominic's eyes darkened with rage. "Who?" The word was a command.

"Zoe." Evelyn hesitated only a second before naming her. If she didn't tell Dominic the truth, she'd never forgive herself. "She admitted it to me. In the elevator."

Zoe heard every word.

She hadn't expected Evelyn to take the bait so easily. She'd thought Evelyn would be smarter.

Zoe inhaled sharply, forcing tears to her eyes. She marched toward them, her voice trembling. "Evelyn! How could you accuse me like this?" She looked devastated. "I moved out of the old Blackwood mansion yesterday. How could I have pushed Aunt Eleanor? At least get your facts straight before slandering me!"

Evelyn froze. Had Zoe lied to her in the elevator?

Normally, Evelyn could spot a lie—but Zoe was different. She wasn't a professional actress, but she was damn convincing.

Dominic's gaze shifted from Zoe to Evelyn. "Evelyn," he said, voice dangerously low. "Do you have anything else to say?" His eyes were full of bitter disappointment.

"Nothing." Evelyn held her ground.

"Apologize to her." His words were slow, deliberate. "Apologize to Zoe."

Evelyn stared at him in disbelief. "Even if I did slander her, I won't apologize. Because I only repeated what she told me. If that's slander, then she slandered herself."
###Chapter 387

Zoe let out a piercing scream. "Evelyn! You're the most despicable woman I've ever met! How dare you twist the truth and pin this on me! If I really did it, why would I be so insane?"

"Oh, but you are insane!" Evelyn countered coolly, watching Zoe's dramatic performance with detached amusement. "Your little act won't last forever. The truth always comes out."

"What act? Evelyn! Explain yourself!" Zoe lunged forward violently. Evelyn swiftly dodged behind Dominic, refusing to engage with the hysterical woman. She wouldn't stoop to Zoe's level.

Dominic shot Evelyn an icy glare before stepping between them.

"Zoe, control yourself! This is a hospital!" he snapped. "My business with her isn't finished yet. Your petty feud can wait!"

With that, he seized Evelyn's arm and dragged her toward the elevators.

The moment they disappeared, Zoe's tears vanished instantly. Though her performance had been fake, her desire to strike Evelyn had been very real.

Julian approached silently, his voice thick with disgust. "Zoe, we're done. I can't stomach your cruelty anymore."

Glancing around the empty corridor, Zoe sneered, "Calling me cruel? That's rich coming from you! You're the one who pushed your grandmother, not me!"

"Your words mean nothing. If you hadn't been whispering poison in my ear every night—"

"If you were truly good, my words wouldn't have swayed you!" Zoe cut him off sharply. "It's too late for regrets now, Julian. The old woman's dead and can't talk. All we have to do is keep quiet and watch the show." Her composure returned instantly. "Your uncle won't let Evelyn off easily."

Julian swallowed hard. "I have no quarrel with Evelyn. She was my girlfriend once!"

Zoe arched an eyebrow. "Oh? Still carrying a torch? Then go confess to your uncle. Tell him you're the one who pushed his mother!"

Julian's face went pale. His terrified gaze shifted to something behind Zoe. She spun around just in time to receive a stinging slap across her face.

"You vile witch!" Gregory roared, his grief-stricken face contorted with rage. "You murdered my mother and poisoned my son's mind!"

Zoe clutched her stinging cheek, tasting blood. Why hit her when Julian was the actual culprit? But she bit back her fury - she couldn't challenge the Blackwoods now.

Julian dropped to his knees. "Father, I'm sorry! It was me! Please don't tell Uncle Dominic! He'll kill me! I never should have listened to this woman!"

Gregory kicked his son savagely. "I'd rather have a dog than a son like you! Get out! You're banished from the Blackwood family until I say otherwise!"

Terrified, Julian scrambled away, with Zoe quickly following.

Gregory's wife Beatrice trembled violently, her face ashen. Clutching her husband's arm, she pleaded, "Don't tell Dominic! If he finds out, he'll kill Julian and blame us too! Let him take his anger out on Evelyn instead!"

Gregory's eyes were bloodshot. "I'm afraid he might actually kill her."

"He won't!"

"How can you be sure? Have you forgotten how my father died?" Gregory choked back a sob, covering 
###Chapter 388

The sleek black Rolls-Royce didn't slow down until they were miles outside Ravenshore City. The highway stretched empty before them.

Evelyn sat stiffly in the backseat, her eyes shut tight against the world.

When the car finally stopped, she blinked at the unfamiliar landscape. Towering evergreens surrounded them, their shadows stretching long across the gravel drive.

Her pulse quickened. Where had Dominic taken her? And why?

"What is this place?" Her voice sounded small in the cavernous interior.

"Mooncrest Manor." He exited without looking back.

A vacation home? Evelyn knew better than to believe that.

She followed him toward the imposing gothic structure. The gray stone mansion loomed like a medieval fortress, its turrets piercing the twilight sky.

Glancing behind her, she saw Nathan Cross and another guard closing ranks. Trapped.

Inside, the vaulted ceilings and dark wood paneling made her shiver. The air smelled of old money and older secrets.

"Evelyn," Dominic's voice cut through the silence, "when exactly did you start conspiring with my mother?"

The heavy oak doors slammed shut with finality.

Evelyn swallowed hard. "If I refuse to answer, do I stay prisoner here?"

His icy laugh echoed off the walls. "You leave when I'm satisfied with your answers."

"I have nothing more to say!" Her hands balled into fists. "Dominic, this is pointless!"

The way his jaw tightened told her she'd struck a nerve.

"Tell me what you discussed with Eleanor." He advanced like a predator. "What could possibly be more important than my mother's last words?"

"Let it go!" Desperation clawed at her throat. "She died at home, not in my office! What good does this interrogation do?"

"Then tell me!" He slammed his palm against the wall, making her flinch. "Is my grief so insignificant to you?"

The raw pain in his voice stunned her into silence.

"That wasn't just anyone who died!" His voice broke. "She was my mother! Don't I deserve to know?"

Seeing the tears glistening in his steel-gray eyes, Evelyn suddenly understood. This wasn't about control - it was about a son drowning in loss.

She remembered that all-consuming grief when Clara died. How reason had abandoned her.

"Dominic... I'm sorry." Her whisper cracked. "I can't answer, not because you don't matter, but because some secrets aren't mine to share."

The devastation on his face would haunt her forever.

Just then, one of the guards stepped forward. "Sir, let me handle this. I'll make her talk."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. She knew exactly what methods men like this employed.

Dominic's expression darkened. He would never allow it - would he?

The unspoken threat hung between them, heavier than the antique chandelier above.

###Chapter 389 The Cruelty of His Mercy

After a brief hesitation, Dominic spun on his heel. His bodyguard immediately understood the unspoken command and seized Evelyn by the arm.

The grand hall plunged into deafening silence.

Evelyn didn't scream or struggle. She simply vanished from his sight. Just like years ago, she disappeared from his life without a sound.

The guards dragged her down to the underground cellar.

The dim space reeked of damp concrete and rusted metal. Strange scratching noises echoed through the narrow passageway as they walked.

A metallic tang of blood hung thick in the air.

Five minutes later, the guard shoved her violently forward.

Evelyn stumbled, her palms landing on something wet and sticky. Terror shot through her veins. Grass. She'd touched artificial turf soaked with... something foul.

"Miss Thorne," the guard sneered, "why don't you turn around?"

Evelyn's blood ran cold as she came face to face with a massive python. Its forked tongue flicked out, tasting her fear.

"Know why we keep it so healthy?" The guard crouched beside her, grinning. "Human flesh is its favorite diet."

Evelyn's entire body trembled uncontrollably.

"Consider this a mercy," the guard whispered, tracing a finger along her jaw. "No plucking your eyes out. No cutting off fingers. Just one quick swallow and it's over. Unless..."

He grabbed her chin roughly. "Unless you tell me what you said to Madam Eleanor. Otherwise, I'll let it nibble on that pretty face of yours first."

Evelyn jerked away with sudden strength, slamming headfirst into the concrete wall.

"Damn it!" The guard scrambled to check her pulse as blood gushed from her forehead. "Is she dead?"

His partner rushed over. "Mr. Blackwood will skin us alive if she dies down here!"

Meanwhile, Dominic paced the mansion's grand hall, glancing at the antique clock for the third time. His chief security officer cleared his throat.

"Sir, Miss Thorne's constitution is weak. The cellar environment might be... excessive."

"I want her to suffer!" Dominic snapped, though his jaw tightened. "That stubborn woman needs to learn her place."

"With all due respect, sir, the men might get carried away. Perhaps I should—"

Before he could finish, Dominic was already striding toward the cellar entrance, his polished shoes clicking sharply against the marble floors.
###Chapter 390

Hush!

A splash of icy water jolted Evelyn back to consciousness. Her vision swam into focus.

The throbbing pain in her temple made her bite back a whimper.

"Still kicking, I see." The guard tossed the empty bucket aside with a clatter. "People don't actually die from hitting walls in real life. What a joke! Death doesn't come that easy!"

"Now what? This bitch won't crack unless we get serious," his partner muttered, cracking his knuckles.

Evelyn lifted her chin defiantly, her fear now crystallized into pure, unadulterated hatred.

Every cruel act from Dominic only hardened her resolve. She'd take the secret of her children's paternity to her grave before letting that monster near them! Better an orphanage than the devil himself as their father!

The guards huddled together, whispering. One suddenly yanked her forward by the hair, making her cry out.

"Listen here, Miss Thorne," he sneered. "Pretty thing like you could snag any rich bastard you want. Why die for this? Just tell us what you said to Madam Eleanor. Spill it, and we'll let you go."

Evelyn's vision blurred dangerously. The impact had left her concussed, though not fatally.

Death held no terror for her. Their threats were meaningless.

Her stony silence infuriated them. "Damn stubborn bitch needs proper motivation!" one spat.

Just then, heavy footsteps echoed through the chamber. Dominic stormed in, his expression thunderous.

"Where is she?!" His voice cracked like a whip.

The lead guard scrambled to explain. "Sir, she's... resilient. The python didn't work - she smashed her head against the wall instead! But don't worry, we're switching to freeze tactics now. Followed by burning. Double the pain—"

Dominic's gut twisted. She'd tried to kill herself?! The thought lanced through him like a blade.

"Sir, give us three days. We'll break her—"

"Idiots!" Dominic roared, kicking the man aside. "Bring her out NOW!"

The guards exchanged confused glances. Was the boss impatient? Did he want to handle the torture himself?

They hurried to the freezer, untying the nearly frozen woman.

As the door opened, an arctic gust swept through the chamber. Dominic's throat tightened.

How long had she been in there? What had they done to her?

He wouldn't admit it was regret gnawing at him. But the memory of her laughter, her warmth, her delicate hands in his—it was driving him mad.

The guards dragged Evelyn's limp form forward. "Still breathing, sir! Just unconscious from the cold!"

Dominic's sharp gaze took in every detail—the ice coating her hair and clothes, the frozen blood on her forehead. The ghastly pallor of her skin against the crimson stain.

###Chapter 391 Evelyn appeared lifeless.

Dominic stared at her barely clinging to life, questioning if this was truly the outcome he desired.

Would her death bring him peace? Then why did his chest ache even more?

He lifted her limp form from the cold floor. Her skin felt like marble against his hands. Carrying her was like holding a winter storm.

"Evelyn!" Dominic roared, his voice raw with emotion, "I haven't authorized your death! You don't get to die!"

The security team detected more than rage in his outburst. Underneath the fury lay panic and something resembling... distress.

"What's wrong with Mr. Blackwood? She's still breathing. Didn't we brief him?" one guard whispered nervously.

His partner observed, "I believe Mr. Blackwood is terrified she might actually die."

Dominic's personal bodyguard glared at them. "You idiots went too far! If anything happens to Evelyn Thorne, your careers are over!"

The two guards paled. "Mr. Blackwood approved the interrogation! We barely touched her! The python was just for show! She's the one who smashed into the wall!"

Dominic carried Evelyn to the master bedroom's king-sized bed.

Medical staff arrived within minutes.

After treating the gash on her forehead, the physician instructed, "Remove these wet clothes and give her a warm bath. Her body temperature must stabilize before she regains consciousness."

Meanwhile at Thornfield Industries, Michael Sterling searched frantically as evening fell. Unable to locate Evelyn, he contacted Nathan Cross.

"Damn it! Has Dominic lost his mind again? Did he abduct Evelyn?"

"Mr. Blackwood's mother passed away."

Michael froze. "You're joking."

Nathan replied grimly, "Would I joke about something like this?"

"Evelyn's disappeared again! This is insane! With his mother gone, surely Dominic wouldn't have time to harass Evelyn?"

"Unclear. I'm heading to Mr. Blackwood's residence now. Sophia's having an episode. He'll likely be occupied for days. Could you take her?"

Michael sighed in exasperation.

An hour later, Nathan delivered Sophia to Mooncrest Manor.

Michael briefed Lily and Henry Thorne about recent events. Processing the news, the children demanded, "Where's Mommy? Where did she go?"

Nathan adjusted his glasses. "Evelyn might be with Mr. Blackwood. He's not at the hospital."

"That monster! Why'd he take Mommy again? I'm furious!" Lily stamped her foot.

Sophia flushed with anxiety. "My brother isn't a monster!"

"He kidnapped our mother! If he's not a monster, who is?"

Unconvinced, Sophia turned to her bodyguard. "I want to call Dominic!"

The bodyguard located Dominic and handed Sophia the phone.

"Miss Sophia insists on speaking with you."

Dominic took the call with a terse greeting.

Hearing his voice, Lily immediately shrieked, "You're evil! Did you take Mommy? Don't hurt her or I'll make Henry publish all your naked shower photos!"

Dominic's brow furrowed at the childish threat.

"Try that, and I'll execute your mother immediately."

He had no patience for these brats. His cruel words were meant to silence them.

Behind him on the bed, Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open. Though her vision remained unfocused, she heard every vicious word.
###Chapter 392

Evelyn should have been devastated, but her eyes remained dry. Her heart felt hollow, numb to the core.

Only the splitting headache remained, pulsing with every breath she took. The pain was unbearable, making even the simplest movement excruciating. She tried to sit up, but her body protested with sharp, stabbing aches.

Fever burned through her. Her skin was scorching to the touch, yet she shivered violently beneath the thin hospital sheets.

When Dominic ended his call, he handed the phone back to his security detail. The bodyguard gestured toward the bed.

Dominic turned. Evelyn's eyes were open, but her expression was disturbingly vacant. She was conscious, yet looked utterly lifeless.

This lifeless version of her enraged him! He wanted her fiery spirit back, wanted her to fight him tooth and nail!

Dominic stormed to the bedside, seizing her chin with his long, elegant fingers.

Her skin burned so fiercely against his touch that he immediately recoiled!

"Get the doctor!" he barked at the bodyguard, who rushed out immediately.

Once they were alone, Evelyn turned her face away, refusing to meet his gaze.

Dominic's fury erupted. He grabbed her chin again, forcing her to look at him. "Evelyn, have you considered what would happen to your children if you died? They just called me."

Evelyn had thought of Lily and Henry before slamming into that wall.

If she died, Michael would raise them. Sophie would visit often. Wesley too...

She knew they wouldn't suffer. They'd only suffer if they fell into Dominic's clutches. Her death would barely affect them.

They'd cry, of course. But compared to the horror of being under his control, their temporary grief meant nothing.

Her expression remained serene. His question didn't faze her.

Dominic realized he'd underestimated her. Evelyn wasn't afraid of death! What weapon did he have left to provoke her?

The doctor arrived promptly. After checking her temperature, he prepared an IV drip.

Dominic stood nearby, watching as the catheter was inserted.

"Mr. Blackwood, dinner is served. Will you be dining now or later?" the bodyguard inquired.

Dominic strode out without answering.

Once the catheter was secured and they were alone, the doctor whispered, "Miss Thorne, why torture yourself like this? This path only leads to ruin."

Evelyn closed her eyes. She and Dominic were past the point of reconciliation. She couldn't change her mind, wouldn't beg. She'd rather die than submit.

The doctor sighed and left.

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn yanked the IV from her hand! Blood welled from the puncture in her pale skin.

Thirty minutes later, Dominic returned with food. His gaze fell on the disconnected IV line, saline dripping uselessly from the abandoned needle.

His face drained of color.

Evelyn truly wanted to die! If not for the fever weakening her, she might have thrown herself from the window or battered herself against the wall again!

"Evelyn, you may want to die, but I won't allow it!" He slammed the food tray onto the bedside table, then grabbed tissues to staunch the blood on her hand.

Evelyn kept her eyes closed, motionless. Dominic froze as sudden understanding struck. Then he roared her name with terrifying intensity, "Evelyn Thorne!"

###Chapter 393

Evelyn's skin burned like fire, her entire body radiating an alarming heat. The flush spreading across her delicate features made it seem as though she might combust at any moment!

No matter how many times Dominic called her name, she remained unresponsive.

His chest tightened painfully.

"Doctor!" Dominic's voice echoed through the sterile halls as he rushed out in search of medical help. The physician arrived swiftly, his expression turning grave the moment he assessed Evelyn's condition. "Mr. Blackwood, we must bring her fever down immediately. Either we restart the IV or administer oral medication. What would you prefer?"

"She's unconscious!" Dominic snapped, his jaw clenching. "How exactly is she supposed to swallow pills? Should I force them down her throat myself?"

A bead of sweat trickled down the doctor's temple. "Then we'll proceed with the IV."

Since the previous saline solution had spilled onto the floor, the doctor had to prepare a new bag before reinserting the catheter.

Dominic stood rigidly beside the bed, his stormy gaze fixed on Evelyn's lifeless form. All he wanted was the truth—why would she rather die than give him the answers he sought?

The thought twisted like a knife in his chest, leaving him torn between fury and despair.

This woman—what had she ever brought him except agony?

At Mooncrest Manor, Lily had cried until her eyes were swollen and red. Between hiccupping sobs, she kept repeating that Dominic was a "very bad man."

Sophia stood nearby like a scolded child, her head bowed in silence.

She had never seen her brother so ruthless. Dominic had always been gentle with her—why was he treating Evelyn with such cruelty?

Nathan shared Sophia's bewilderment. While he understood Dominic's grief over his mother's death, he couldn't fathom why Evelyn had become the target of his wrath.

"Mr. Blackwood must have his reasons," Nathan murmured to Michael, adjusting his sses.

Michael's temper flared. "Just get out!"

"Then... Sophia stays with you for now?" Nathan needed to ensure her safety.

"Of course she stays!" Michael growled. "If Dominic lays a single finger on Evelyn, I'll personally dissect Sophia myself!"

Nathan sighed. "Very well. Take care of her until they return. I'll come back tomorrow."

Once Nathan left, Michael scooped Lily into his arms. "Sweetheart, stop crying. Dominic was just trying to scare us because he's afraid we'll leak his ugly photos."

Lily sniffled, her tiny fists clenched. "Uncle Michael, I don't like him anymore."

"Since when did you like him?" Michael frowned.

Lily's lower lip trembled. "In my dreams, he was nice..."

"Oh, so you liked the version of him in your dreams?"

She nodded miserably. She had so desperately wanted her father to be good, to one day reconcile with him. But reality had shattered that hope too many times.

She was done with fantasies.

All she wanted now was her mother back.

By ten o'clock that night, Evelyn's fever finally broke. Three IV bags later, her body finally surrendered to the treatment.

Her eyelids fluttered open, revealing the unfamiliar room. Memories trickled back slowly.

"Miss Thorne, you're awake?" A gentle voice spoke—a nanny Dominic had hired to tend to her.

"You haven't eaten all day. You must be starving. I've prepared some oatmeal." The nanny lifted the lid of the thermos, releasing a warm, comforting aroma.

"Let me help you."

Evelyn turned her face away, her heavy eyelids sealing shut once more. She refused to speak—not to the nanny, not to anyone associated with Dominic.

If he wouldn't release her, she would rather waste away.

The nanny sighed and left to consult Dominic.

Moments later, his imposing figure filled the doorway. Fresh from a shower, he wore a slate-gray robe, his damp hair tousled.

He approached the bed, his gaze boring into Evelyn's exhausted face.

"Evelyn," he warned, his voice dangerously low, "if you won't let the nanny feed you, I'll do it myself."

Her fingers tightened around the sheets.

She ignored him.

###Chapter 394 Dominic's Expression Turned Stormy at Evelyn's Defiant Silence!

Dominic could have forced her mouth open and shoved food down her throat spoon by spoon. But he refused to stoop so low.

If she wanted to starve herself to death, so be it!

With a furious glare, he turned on his heel and slammed the door behind him.

The moment he left, Evelyn exhaled shakily. Suddenly, a car horn blared outside the window.

She strained her ears. Multiple vehicles were pulling up the gravel driveway of the remote manor.

Within minutes, raucous laughter and clinking glasses echoed from downstairs. Who would visit this isolated retreat so late at night?

Dominic had mentioned this was one of his private vacation homes. Had he invited guests here?

His mother's funeral was barely over, yet instead of mourning, he was hosting some kind of gathering in the middle of nowhere?!

As she swung her legs off the bed to investigate, the door burst open.

The physician entered carrying his medical kit. "Miss Thorne, I heard you're refusing meals. Mr. Blackwood ordered me to administer intravenous vitamins," he said with a weary sigh. "You must eat. Self-harm solves nothing. Despite today's events, I can see Mr. Blackwood still cares deeply for you—"

"Care?!" she thought bitterly.

Because he hadn't strangled her with his bare hands, that constituted care?

The doctor hung the IV bag and inserted the needle, watching her like a hawk for any sudden movements.

Evelyn understood his vigilance. "It's fine. You can go. I won't remove it."

"You promise? Last time you ripped it out, Mr. Blackwood held me personally responsible."

"I won't."

The commotion downstairs grew louder—definitely more than just a small gathering.

As host, Dominic would be occupied with his guests. This was her chance.

"Miss Thorne, I'm relieved you're being cooperative. When it's time to remove—" the doctor began.

"I'll do it myself," she interrupted.

"Ah, you do know how—just not gently," he joked before exiting.

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn yanked out the IV and rushed to the window.

Dozens of luxury cars lined the driveway, their headlights cutting through the darkness. More vehicles were still arriving.

What was happening tonight? A cold night breeze whipped through her hair as she gripped the windowsill. The day's events replayed in her mind—surreal and grotesque.

She'd never been closer to death.

Previously, she'd clung to life for her children's sake—to watch them grow.

Now even that seemed like an impossible luxury.

Downstairs in the grand hall, glasses clinked amid boisterous conversation.

"Dominic, enough talk! Bottoms up!"

The group drank deeply.

"How long has it been since we all gathered?"

"Four, five years? We're all too busy these days! Should make this an annual tradition!"

Just then, servants wheeled in an elaborate barbecue setup, placing it center stage.

"Barbecue tonight?"

"Whatever Dominic serves, we'll devour!"

The crowd cheered as two bodyguards dramatically unveiled the supper selection.

"No way! Is that what I think it is?"

"Damn! Now this is a surprise!"

Amid the excited chatter about the lavish spread, Evelyn slipped silently down the grand staircase.

###Chapter 395

The bodyguards immediately alerted Dominic when they spotted Evelyn descending the stairs.

Dominic rose from the leather couch, his piercing gaze locking onto the staircase.

Evelyn was drowning in his oversized robe - the hem dragging along the marble steps, the sleeves swallowing her delicate hands.

She looked like a lost child wrapped in an adult's clothing, the contrast almost comical.

His brows knitted together. She was supposed to be resting with an IV drip. What was she doing out of bed?

"Dominic! Keeping secrets now?" One of his friends chuckled, spotting Evelyn's approach.

"Come on, he's a grown man! It'd be strange if he didn't have company!" Another teased.

"Is she from one of the noble families? Or just some temporary entertainment?"

Dominic ignored their questions, his focus entirely on Evelyn's determined stride toward them.

This woman who'd been begging for death now willingly facing his inner circle? What game was she playing?

He intercepted her path, storm clouds gathering in his dark eyes. "Did you remove the IV again?"

Her small hands pressed lightly against his chest. "You're hosting guests. Can't I join?"

Join? Fine. If she wanted to play, he'd let her.

Stepping aside, he watched as Evelyn's gaze landed on the outdoor grill.

Her face drained of color. Her knees buckled. A violent shudder wracked her body as she stumbled backward.

Their dinner tonight was the very python that had terrorized her into colliding with a wall.

She could still feel its hot breath, see its gaping maw. Now it lay cleaned and skewered over glowing coals.

Noticing her distress, Dominic seized her wrist and dragged her to the sofa.

"Since you're here, you might as well try some," he murmured, his voice deceptively smooth.

Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs. Why had he killed it? She didn't dare dwell on the implications.

Like a marionette, she allowed him to deposit her onto the cushions.

"Isn't that Evelyn Thorne of Thornfield Industries?" Recognition sparked among the guests.

"Ah, I've heard rumors about her."

"You two are full of surprises! Keeping this under wraps?"

"Honestly, I only noticed her company because people mentioned its beautiful young CEO."

Evelyn lowered her lashes and reached for a wine glass.

Dominic intercepted her hand. She'd been receiving fever-reducing IV medication. Alcohol would counteract it.

He replaced the wine with water, signaling a bodyguard without breaking eye contact.

"Mind your own drinks," Evelyn muttered, slipping from his side to the opposite sofa.

Dominic's jaw tightened as she settled beside a complete stranger. She'd rather sit with unfamiliar men than near him?

"Don't worry, Dominic! I'll be gentle with your little rose!" The man beside Evelyn laughed.

Dominic's expression darkened as he downed his drink in one swallow.

An hour later, the python was served. The feast began.

Dominic excused himself to the restroom.

Evelyn watched him leave before taking a sip of water.

When Dominic returned, his gaze immediately found the empty space where Evelyn had been.

"She went to freshen up," a friend explained, refilling Dominic's glass. "Drink up!"

At two AM, slightly unsteady, Dominic ascended the stairs with a bodyguard's assistance.

He pushed open Evelyn's bedroom door.

The room was empty. The bed untouched.

Where the hell had Evelyn gone?

###Chapter 396

Dominic assumed Evelyn had slipped away to the restroom before retreating to her room.

When he realized she'd gone upstairs instead, he set down his wine glass with a sharp clink.

A chilling thought sliced through his drunken haze—had Evelyn... run away?

Mooncrest Manor was encircled by a hundred-kilometer radius of dense, untamed wilderness.

In her weakened state, how could she possibly navigate that treacherous forest alone?

His fingers curled into white-knuckled fists as he pivoted toward the staircase.

"Mr. Blackwood!" A bodyguard snapped to attention. "I'll review the surveillance footage immediately! We'll track her exit point!"

The man swallowed hard before adding, "It's pitch black out there with no streetlights. She couldn't have gone far."

"Useless!" Dominic's voice was a whip-crack of fury. "You can't even keep one woman contained?"

"Sir, I'll mobilize every guard—we'll have her back by sunrise!" The bodyguard's promise trembled with barely concealed panic.

The alcohol evaporated from Dominic's bloodstream. His mind became frighteningly clear, a terrible certainty taking root.

"She left before midnight," he calculated aloud. "I noticed her absence after returning from the washroom. Check the footage—someone must have aided her escape!"

The bodyguard nodded. "My thoughts exactly, sir. She couldn't have breached security alone."

Downstairs, Dominic's oldest friends still lingered over drinks.

His gaze locked onto one figure in particular—Nicholas Vaughn. Evelyn had been seated beside him earlier.

At the time, Dominic had dismissed it as coincidence. Now the calculated placement screamed conspiracy.

"Nicholas." Dominic wrenched the wine glass from the man's hand. "Did you help Evelyn escape?"

Nicholas lifted bloodshot eyes, his expression unreadable. "Yes."

A shocked murmur rippled through the group.

"What the hell, Nick?" someone demanded. "Since when do you know Evelyn Thorne well enough to betray Dominic?"

Nicholas shrugged, his words slurred but deliberate. "Simple. I owed her. She called in that debt tonight."

He refilled his glass with shaking hands. "Better to owe my brothers than an outsider."

The crystal stem shattered in Dominic's grip, crimson droplets splattering like blood.

"You've signed her death warrant!" Dominic's roar shook the chandeliers. "That forest is lethal after dark!"

Nicholas merely arched a brow. "Her survival wasn't part of our agreement. If you're so concerned, perhaps ask why she'd rather face certain death than remain here with you?"

A bodyguard came sprinting in, breathless. "Sir! Miss Thorne exited through the rear service entrance! That path leads straight to the ravine—in her condition—"

Dominic was already moving, his polished shoes crushing glass shards as he stormed toward the back door.

One terrible truth crystallized in his mind—this wasn't an escape attempt.

It was a suicide mission.

The grand hall remained electric with tension long after Dominic's departure.

"Nick," someone pressed, "how exactly did you owe Evelyn Thorne? You've never mentioned knowing her."

Nicholas swirled his wine with a humorless smile. "That woman is anything but ordinary."

"Since when do you care about Dominic's playthings?"

A dangerous glint entered Nicholas's eyes. "Make no mistake—Evelyn Thorne is no one's plaything."

He drained his glass in one bitter swallow. "I swore to keep her secrets. But if she dies tonight?"

The empty glass hit the table with finality. "Dominic won't just cut ties. He'll make sure I join her in hell."

###Chapter 397

The forest stretched endlessly before them, a sea of towering trees and tangled undergrowth. Wild creatures lurked in its shadows, their presence a constant threat. Even in daylight, attacks were possible—but at night, they were almost certain.

N?vel(D)ra/ma.Org exclusive ? material.

With his bodyguards forming a protective circle around him, Dominic Blackwood stepped into the unknown depths of the terrifying wilderness.

The torch in his grip cast flickering light against the oppressive darkness, revealing twisted vines and gnarled branches. Despair clawed at his chest.

How could she? How could Evelyn Thorne have dared to enter this death trap? Did she truly believe she could survive?

If she knew this path led to certain doom, why hadn’t she turned back? Even if she had escaped the manor, she could have returned. He wouldn’t have been so furious with her.

"Evelyn!" His voice trembled as he shouted her name into the void.

The bodyguards echoed his call, their voices cutting through the eerie silence. "Miss Thorne! We're here for you! If you can hear us, answer!"

Only the distant cries of unseen animals answered them, along with the whispering wind and the rustling of leaves.

After struggling forward for another twenty minutes, the torchlight illuminated something on the ground—a robe.

Evelyn’s robe.

That afternoon, after washing her, Dominic had wrapped her in his own robe, as she had no other clothes. He had secured it around her himself.

So why was it here? How had it ended up discarded in the middle of the forest?

His heart hammered violently. He strode forward and snatched it up.

"Mr. Blackwood," one of the bodyguards said grimly, "the robe is torn. There’s blood on it."

Dominic’s hands shook as he gripped the fabric. The jagged tear and dark stains confirmed his worst fears.

She must have encountered a wild animal. Otherwise, the robe wouldn’t be ripped, and there wouldn’t be blood.

Evelyn was injured. And now, she had nothing to cover herself. Even if she survived the attack, she would freeze to death without protection from the elements.

Dominic refused to let his mind spiral further.

"Mr. Blackwood," the bodyguard reasoned, "Miss Thorne is hurt. She couldn’t have gone far. If we keep moving, we’ll find her."

Dominic’s eyes burned. He clenched his fists and pressed forward, deeper into the suffocating darkness.

Ten minutes later, they found her.

A pale figure curled into the underbrush, motionless.

The torchlight washed over Evelyn’s bare skin, illuminating her fragile form. Tears welled in Dominic’s eyes.

He had never imagined he would drive her to this—helpless, exposed, on the brink of death.

He loved her.

No woman had ever captivated him the way she did. He was consumed by her.

And yet, he had pushed her into this nightmare.

The bodyguards hesitated, keeping their distance out of respect for her nudity.

Dominic didn’t hesitate. He stripped off his jacket and draped it over her before lifting her into his arms.

Then, the skies opened.

Rain poured down in sheets, slicing through the forest canopy, drenching them without mercy.

###Chapter 398

The rain had drenched them completely by the time they reached Mooncrest Manor.

It was three in the morning.

A few of Dominic's friends were still gathered in the grand hall, drinks in hand, waiting for his return. When they saw him stride in with Evelyn cradled in his arms, they all rose from their seats.

The air thickened with tension.

No one dared to speak.

Dominic wore only a thin black t-shirt, now soaked through, clinging to his sculpted frame. Water dripped from his dark hair, tracing the sharp lines of his jaw.

His amber eyes burned with a hollow, devastating darkness.

Evelyn was wrapped tightly in his jacket, her face deathly pale. Her closed lashes looked as if they would never flutter open again.

The sight was heartbreaking.

Without a word, Dominic carried her upstairs, disappearing from view.

The autopsy report for Eleanor Blackwood arrived the next morning. Gregory sent it to Dominic immediately.

The findings were clear: no poison, no foul play. She had died from the fall.

Gregory suggested holding the funeral the following day. Once Dominic agreed, Gregory notified close family and friends.

At Mooncrest Manor, Nathan came to visit Sophia.

She had improved significantly after her second surgery. Though she still required care, she was far more independent than before.

"Mr. Blackwood's mother's funeral is tomorrow," Nathan told Michael quietly. "He'll be attending. Maybe he'll bring Evelyn back with him."

Michael nodded. "Can you take me there?"

Nathan stared at him, incredulous. "Only senior executives received invitations. I'm just an assistant—I can't bring guests. Besides, why do you want to go? If you cause trouble, do you think the guards won't shoot you on sight?"

Michael wasn’t suicidal, but he hadn’t been able to reach Evelyn for two days. The children were growing restless, their moods darkening with each passing hour.

If Evelyn didn’t return soon, he didn’t know how he’d explain it to them.

Henry overheard their conversation. His small face hardened with determination. He had to find his mother. He would bring her back.

Eleanor Blackwood’s funeral was a somber, heavily guarded affair.

At eight sharp, Dominic’s car arrived at the venue. He stepped out, dressed head to toe in black, his expression unreadable.

Nathan discreetly texted Michael: [He came alone. Evelyn isn’t with him.]

Michael’s reply was immediate: [Damn it.]

[Don’t worry. I’ll ask him about her after the service.]

[I’m outside.]

[You’re here?!]

[Yeah. I brought Henry and Sophia with me.]

Nathan’s stomach dropped. [Why would you bring them? Don’t do anything stupid. You know he hates threats. And there are armed guards everywhere—some you can’t even see. If you cause a scene, you’ll get yourself killed.]

Michael replied: [Touched that you care so much.]

Nathan rolled his eyes. […]

[Henry insisted. I couldn’t stop him. Stay out of it.]

Nathan’s head throbbed. Was Henry planning to disrupt the funeral? He debated warning Dominic—but it might already be too late.
###Chapter 399

When Nathan saw Michael's messages, he hesitated.

Forget it! He wouldn't get involved this time. He'd pretend he knew nothing. Dominic had clearly crossed the line this time.

How could he take Evelyn away without informing her family?

If Nathan were Michael, he'd be furious too.

Time ticked by, approaching eleven in the morning. Henry hadn't caused any disturbance. Nathan hadn't even caught a glimpse of him.

He didn't know Henry's current plan. Whatever it was, the boy might have already abandoned it.

After the funeral, guests proceeded to the hotel for lunch.

Nathan approached Dominic cautiously.

"Mr. Blackwood."

Dominic stopped and turned, his gaze icy.

"My condolences," Nathan offered awkwardly.

Dominic gave a curt nod and continued toward the parking lot. Nathan hurried after him, summoning courage to ask, "Mr. Blackwood, is Miss Thorne with you? Her children are worried about her safety—"

Dominic swallowed hard, his voice rough. "She's not dead."

Nathan blinked in confusion. What kind of answer was that? Not dead could mean alive but injured... or barely clinging to life. Where was she? What condition was she in?

While Nathan stood stunned, Dominic reached the black Rolls-Royce.

The bodyguard opened the door, reporting helplessly, "Miss Sophia insisted on waiting for you in the car."

Sophia looked up with bright, determined eyes. "Big Brother, I want to stay with you. Wherever you go, I'm going too."

Dominic paused at the car door, studying his sister's stubborn expression. Something thick lodged in his throat.

He entered the car and shut the door firmly.

"Sophia, I'm taking you home."

Her eyes reddened slightly as she shook her head.

"I have unfinished business," Dominic explained, taking her hand. "Once it's settled, I'll come home to spend time with you."

"Big Brother, you're a good person," Sophia said with disappointment. "But why were you so cruel to Evelyn? I heard you say you wanted to kill her. It scared me..."

Dominic squeezed her hand gently. "I was just frightening the children. You're not a child, Sophia. You know I wouldn't really do that, right?"

"Promise you won't hurt Evelyn?" Sophia pleaded. "If you do, Lily and Henry won't play with me anymore."

Dominic's expression darkened. "Don't worry about such things. Just wait for me at home."

Though unsatisfied, Sophia nodded obediently.

After escorting Sophia home, Dominic returned swiftly to his car. The black Rolls-Royce sped north like a phantom.

Meanwhile, in the forest mansion, Evelyn lay on the massive white bed, her eyes fluttering open.

Memories of last night's escape flooded back—the wolf attack in the woods. If not for Nicholas giving her that dagger when helping her escape, she might have been torn apart.

Never had she imagined fighting off a wolf with a dagger in hand.

The wolf had bitten her once, but she'd stabbed it in return—a bloody draw. After her counterattack, the wounded creature fled. She'd collapsed from blood loss, certain death awaited her... yet here she was, alive.

Her gaze swept the familiar room. One burning question remained: Had Dominic carried her back last night?
###Chapter 400

"Miss Thorne, you're finally awake!" A deep male voice pierced through the fog in her mind.

Evelyn turned her head weakly toward the sound. It was Dominic's personal guard.

"Miss Thorne, do you recall what transpired last night?"

The guard stood rigidly beside her bed. "When Mr. Blackwood carried you back through the storm, the rain was torrential! He lost his shoe in the mud and carried you barefoot the entire way!"

Evelyn's lips parted slightly in shock.

"Your leg injury is severe, but Mr. Blackwood's feet were shredded by the terrain..." The guard's gaze dropped meaningfully to her bandaged thigh.

"You both developed fevers from the exposure. After tending to your wounds, he barely had time to dress his own injuries before leaving for Madame Eleanor's funeral without rest."

The guard studied her impassive face, wondering if the fever had dulled her senses.

"Miss Thorne, you're the most fearless woman I've ever encountered." Admiration colored his tone.

"At dawn, we discovered a wounded wolf nearby. That must be the beast that attacked you? Astounding! Someone of your stature battling a wolf unarmed!"

"I had a dagger," Evelyn rasped before erupting into violent coughs. "Miss Thorne, conserve your strength. Just listen," the guard insisted.

"We cooked the wolf. Consider it vengeance served."

Evelyn blinked slowly.

"My colleague also wishes to apologize for the python incident in the cellar yesterday. They don't actually consume humans. It was merely...persuasion."

"Why apologize to me?" Evelyn's voice scraped like sandpaper.

"Because we misjudged the situation. We believed Mr. Blackwood despised you. None of us realized his...attachment." The guard shifted uncomfortably.

"I'm not making excuses for him. But please don't punish my team. Their loyalty lies with Mr. Blackwood—"

"I need rest," Evelyn interrupted wearily.

"Of course. I'll summon the physician." The guard retreated.

Soon, a white-coated doctor entered, checking Evelyn's vitals.

"You still have a moderate fever, Miss Thorne," the doctor announced after examination. "Significant blood loss has caused anemia. Complete bed rest is mandatory. Your thigh wound is severe—deep enough to scar."

Evelyn felt like a marionette with cut strings.

Testing her limbs proved futile. Though conscious, she might as well have been paralyzed. No energy. No reaction. Just the hollow exhaustion of survival.

"I'll have the housekeeper prepare restorative broth," the doctor said before departing.

Evelyn stared blankly at the crystal chandelier above.

Sunlight refracted through the prisms, casting rainbow patterns that mocked the darkness in her soul.

A car's arrival interrupted her thoughts.

Through the window, she saw the black Rolls-Royce glide to a stop. Dominic emerged.

"Mr. Blackwood! Miss Thorne is awake!" The guard reported. "She's been...remarkably composed."

Now aware of their employer's true feelings, the guards treated Evelyn with newfound respect.

Dominic strode inside, intercepting the housekeeper carrying a tray.

"The physician ordered light nourishment for Miss Thorne," the woman explained.

Dominic took the tray himself and ascended the stairs. He stood beside her bed, bowl in hand.

Evelyn's breath hitched when he appeared, though her expression remained neutral.

"Open." He lifted a spoonful of broth to her lips.

"Evelyn," his voice turned steely, "if you ever want to see Lily and Henry again—if you want Margaret to pay—you'll eat."

Her fever-bright eyes locked onto his as she weakly raised a hand.

"I'll feed myself."

Though her voice was ravaged by illness, the defiance in her spirit burned undimmed.
###Chapter 401

Dominic clenched his jaw, his piercing gaze fixed on Evelyn. He set the porcelain bowl of oatmeal aside and gently helped her sit up.

With careful movements, he arranged two plush pillows behind her back for support. Then he placed the bowl back into her trembling hands.

Evelyn accepted it, but as she reached for the spoon, her left hand suddenly lost all strength. The bowl slipped from her grasp, spilling its contents across the silk duvet.

The warm oatmeal spread in an uneven pattern across the expensive bedding.

Evelyn stared at the mess with wide, horrified eyes. Her lips pressed into a thin line.

Dominic's chest tightened painfully. He knew this wasn't intentional. Evelyn genuinely wanted to feed herself, but her body betrayed her - she couldn't even maintain a grip on something as simple as a bowl.

Before tears could spill from Evelyn's eyes, Dominic swiftly removed the soiled bedding.

"Evelyn, you'll regain your strength. Don't cry!" His words came out harsher than intended, sounding more like a command than comfort.

He inhaled deeply, preparing to explain, but Evelyn had already turned away, curling onto her side.

Though no sobs reached Dominic's ears, he felt the silent tremors of her despair. He retrieved a fresh duvet from the walk-in closet and draped it over her slender form.

"I'll have the housekeeper prepare another bowl," Dominic murmured, his voice thick with emotion. He remained seated at her bedside, watching the gentle rise and fall of her shoulders.

Evelyn kept her eyes closed, offering no response. A wave of dizziness washed over her - likely from the blood loss and exhaustion.

Once her breathing evened out in sleep, Dominic finally left the room. He hadn't slept the previous night, and now a dull ache pulsed behind his temples. He retreated to his own chambers to rest.

Approximately an hour after Dominic fell asleep, flames erupted on the hillside behind Mooncrest Manor.

Every security guard on the property rushed toward the emergency, leaving the mansion temporarily unguarded.

Henry, his small backpack secured tightly, emerged from the shadows near the grand entrance. He'd hidden in the trunk of Dominic's car earlier that day.

With all staff occupied by the fire, the manor stood eerily empty. Not a single soul remained inside.

Henry's sharp eyes scanned the expansive foyer. The guest rooms and master suite weren't immediately visible - just the kitchen and staff quarters visible from his vantage point.

After memorizing the first floor layout, the boy stealthily ascended the grand staircase. He found Evelyn in the second bedroom he checked. His small feet carried him swiftly to her bedside.

"Mommy!" Henry's initial shout died in his throat when he noticed Evelyn's peaceful slumber. He whispered instead, "Mommy, I'm here."

Evelyn, weakened and deep in healing sleep, didn't stir.

Henry stood vigil beside the bed, studying his mother's pale features. He resolved to wait patiently for her to wake naturally, even if it meant risking discovery. He didn't know what Dominic would do when he found him here, but Henry refused to be separated from his mother again.

With her by his side, he feared nothing.

The commotion from the hillside eventually roused Dominic. The moment consciousness returned, he went straight to check on Evelyn. His hand turned the ornate bedroom doorknob.

Inside, Henry heard the telltale click of the turning mechanism. His head snapped toward the sound. In that instant, father and son locked eyes across the threshold.
###Chapter 402

When Dominic saw Henry, he froze in disbelief. Had he entered the wrong room? What was Henry doing here? How had the boy even gotten in?

Dominic realized this child would always find ways to shock him.

Though this time, the surprise was far from pleasant.

"Why is Mommy hurt?" Henry stood rigid by the bedside, his piercing gaze locked onto his father's face.

He'd noticed the bandages wrapped around Evelyn's forehead immediately. The stark white gauze stood out against her pale skin, evidence of some injury.

Worse still, when he'd called her name, she hadn't responded. She wasn't sleeping - she was unconscious.

Helpless anger churned in his small chest. He couldn't carry her to safety. He couldn't treat her wounds. All he could do was demand answers.

Dominic ignored the question. His cold eyes swept over the small figure. "How did you get here? Who brought you?"

"I came alone!" Henry's voice shook with barely contained fury. "You hurt Mommy! I'll never forgive you!"

A humorless laugh escaped Dominic's lips. "And what exactly do you plan to do? Don't think your childish tricks will work on me every time, Henry. If your last name wasn't Thorne, how long do you think I'd tolerate this behavior?"

Henry's face twisted in disgust. "I don't even want to see you! You're the one who keeps coming after us!"

"Coming after you?" Dominic's voice turned dangerous. "Your mother and I knew each other long before you existed. Our business has nothing to do with you!" The contempt in Henry's expression made his blood boil.

"You heartless monster! Mommy's business is my business!"

"Heartless?" Dominic roared, his control slipping. "You know nothing, you insolent brat! Say that again, I dare you!"

Henry's fear evaporated in the face of his rage. "I may not know everything, but I know you're a cruel, evil man! You're not just heartless - you're sick!"

Dominic's entire body went rigid. A vein pulsed at his temple. "What did you just say?"

"Didn't you say I don't know anything?" Henry's small chin lifted defiantly. "You're the sick one! You're not normal! That's why you keep hurting Mommy! She'll never love you! Lily and I will never love you! Nobody loves you!"

The memory flashed through Henry's mind - last year, when Lily had returned from Dominic's study clutching a dark red box. Inside had been medical reports. Dominic's medical reports.

At first, the terminology had confused him. But Henry had painstakingly researched every word. And what he'd discovered had chilled him to the bone.

The diagnosis was clear: Dominic Blackwood suffered from a severe mental disorder.

Eldermere law stated that those with such conditions couldn't be held accountable for violent acts.

Henry had tried to dig deeper, but Dominic's records were sealed tight. This single secret was all he'd uncovered.

He'd never planned to use it. Not until Dominic hurt his mother again.

Dominic's face darkened as if an old wound had been ripped open. How could a four-year-old speak with such conviction? Who had put these words in his mouth? Michael Sterling? Or Evelyn herself?

Dark memories surged forward, threatening to drown him. His vision tunneled.

The smug look on Henry's face ignited something primal within him. Before he could stop himself, Dominic's hands closed around the boy's slender throat.

Henry gasped, his small hands clawing at the iron grip.

On the bed, Evelyn thrashed in her nightmare. With a strangled cry, she jolted awake - just in time to see her son's small body lifted off the ground by his neck.
###Chapter 403

The man holding Henry by the throat was Dominic!

Dominic had his hands wrapped around Henry's neck, choking him mercilessly!

Evelyn must be hallucinating. There was no way Henry could be here. She'd had this nightmare before - too many times to count.

Five years ago, Dominic had vowed to kill any child she bore him. That threat had haunted her dreams ever since.

In her nightmares, she'd seen Dominic torture their children in countless horrifying ways.

This exact scene had played out in her mind repeatedly over the years.

But this time felt different. The scene before her eyes was terrifyingly real.

Henry struggled desperately, his backpack hitting the floor with a heavy thump.

Evelyn blinked rapidly. Suddenly, reality crashed over her like a tidal wave. Her blood ran cold.

This wasn't a dream. This was really happening!

"Dominic! Stop!" she screamed, her voice raw with panic. She tried to scramble off the bed, but her injured legs betrayed her.

After a brief struggle with the sheets, she tumbled to the floor in a heap.

Tears burned her eyes as she grabbed Dominic's pant leg with shaking hands. "Dominic! You can't do this! He's your—" A violent coughing fit cut her off.

Blood splattered from her lips, staining both her hospital gown and Dominic's expensive trousers.

The sight of her distress seemed to snap Dominic out of his rage. His grip loosened.

Henry collapsed to the ground, gasping for air. His face was still blue as he crawled toward Evelyn.

"Mommy!" Henry threw his arms around her, tears streaming down his face. "Mommy, are you okay?"

Remarkably, Henry hadn't shed a single tear while being strangled. But seeing Evelyn cough up blood destroyed his composure.

Evelyn released Dominic's pants and pulled Henry close. "Henry, baby, are you hurt? Tell me you're okay," she murmured between shaky breaths. The thought of what might have happened if she'd woken even a second later made her stomach churn.

"I'm fine, Mommy! But you're bleeding!" Henry reached up with trembling fingers to wipe the blood from her chin.

Evelyn caught his small hand and exhaled shakily. "Why are you here? Who brought you? Was it Michael? Where is he?"

She needed Henry out of this hospital immediately. Dominic was too dangerous. She couldn't risk a repeat of what just happened.

Henry shook his head, avoiding her gaze. "I came alone. Lily and I were so worried about you."

Evelyn pulled him into a crushing hug, her usual icy demeanor melting away completely.

Dominic watched this emotional reunion with growing irritation. Without a word, he stormed out of the room.

Moments later, doctors rushed in. They gently separated Henry from Evelyn and helped her back into bed.

Henry stood by the bedside, his small hands clenched into fists as he took in the extent of Evelyn's injuries. Bandages covered her legs completely, and her forehead bore fresh stitches.

What had that monster done to his mother?

"Dominic will pay for this," Henry thought fiercely, wiping his tears angrily.

With determined fingers, he pressed the emergency button on his smartwatch.
###Chapter 404

The crimson button was an emergency beacon. It linked directly to Michael. If Henry pressed it, the signal would transmit his exact coordinates. Michael would also alert the authorities immediately. Henry would never have confronted Dominic under normal circumstances! But Dominic left him no choice.

"Henry..." Evelyn murmured anxiously from her hospital bed once they were alone.

Henry rushed to her side, clutching her trembling hand. "Mommy, don't worry. I'm right here."

Evelyn's eyes darted nervously toward the doorway. "Henry, I can't move properly yet. Once I recover, I'll come home. When Dominic returns, I'll make him arrange transportation for you. You must promise to behave and listen."

Henry's small face darkened. "Mommy, don't beg him! I'm taking you home myself! I swore to Lily I'd bring you back!"

"My injuries..."

"I already contacted the police. They'll escort us home."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Over Henry's shoulder, she saw Dominic looming in the doorway. She yanked Henry closer protectively. The boy turned, following his mother's terrified gaze.

Spotting Dominic's glacial expression, Henry squared his shoulders defiantly. "I called the authorities!" he announced loudly.

"Henry, hush!" Evelyn pleaded, terrified of provoking Dominic further.

The vivid bruises circling Henry's neck served as constant reminders - she couldn't afford recklessness. She might perish here, but Henry must survive!

Dominic strode forward, his aura murderous.

"Don't push me," he warned through gritted teeth, staring down at Henry. "Leave. Now. Or I'll toss you to the wolves in the forest."

Evelyn's chest heaved. "Dominic! He's five years old! How can you threaten a child?"

"I despise children. Especially this adopted brat of yours. He disgusts me."

"He was worried about me! If anyone's to blame, it's me!" Evelyn choked back sobs. "Just send him home! I've already talked to him. He won't cause trouble!"

"Didn't he summon the police? Let them handle his transportation," Dominic sneered before turning his predatory gaze on Henry.

"That forest fire was your doing, wasn't it?"

Henry lifted his chin. "Yes."

Dominic's lips curled. "Even if I don't kill you today, you'll rot in prison someday." With that final threat, he stormed out.

The cowering doctor finally emerged from the corner, clutching medication.

"Miss Thorne, is this your son?" he asked awkwardly. "Remarkable that he found his way here alone."

Evelyn exhaled shakily. "Doctor, please examine the bruises on his neck."

Only then did the physician notice the dark fingerprints encircling Henry's throat.

"My God! What happened?"

Evelyn remained silent. Henry pressed his lips into a thin line.

The doctor cleared his throat. "Young man, I understand you dislike Mr. Blackwood, but he wouldn't harm your mother. Her leg injury came from a wolf attack in the woods."

"What about her forehead?" Henry demanded.

Before the doctor could respond, Evelyn interjected, "I did that to myself, Henry."

She couldn't let Henry's hatred fester. Against Dominic's power, her son stood no chance. Provoking him meant certain death.
###Chapter 405

That day's events served as a brutal wake-up call. Evelyn would never allow her son to confront Dominic directly again.

"But you wouldn't get hurt without reason. It must have been him..." Henry deduced, his small brow furrowing deeply.

"I wanted to see you and Lily so badly last night that I went out alone. Then I encountered a wolf," Evelyn explained carefully. "Go tell Uncle Michael and Lily I'm fine. I don't want them worrying, okay?"

Henry nodded slowly, suspicion still clouding his young features.

"Mommy, aren't you coming home with me? The police can take us both."

"My leg injury is too painful right now. I'll return once it heals properly."

"Oh Mommy, please don't wander around anymore. If it's so dangerous outside, just stay inside. We'll find a way to get you back."

Evelyn exhaled in relief. "Henry, I'm so happy you came looking for me. But if anything like this happens again, don't come. You're still so small. If anything happened to you..." Her voice broke.

Henry's jaw set stubbornly. "If something happened to you, what would happen to me and Lily? If there's a next time, I'll still come."

Tears burned Evelyn's eyes. "There won't be a next time."

"Mommy, please stay far away from him... He's sick."

Evelyn assumed Henry only said this because Dominic had nearly strangled him.

"He won't hurt me. But you and Lily must stay away. Henry, didn't I tell you both last year? Never go near him. Didn't you listen?"

Henry's gaze dropped to the floor.

"You and Lily are my most precious treasures. My greatest wish is seeing you both grow up healthy and safe," Evelyn whispered. "So remember what I've told you."

Henry gave a reluctant nod, his small shoulders slumped.

An hour later, police vehicles arrived at the forest mansion. Henry climbed into the backseat.

"Henry, where's your mother?" Michael demanded, scanning the area with the officers. After speaking with Dominic's bodyguards, the police had simply escorted Henry out.

Just like that?

"Mommy's leg is injured. She can't move right now." Henry's voice carried his disappointment at leaving Evelyn behind.

"How did she get hurt? Is it bad?"
"A wolf bit her."
Michael's head snapped around. "Wolves? There are wolves here? Or is the wolf actually Dominic in disguise?"

Henry remained silent.

"Mr. Blackwood's security team explained Miss Thorne went out alone at night and was attacked by a wolf," an officer clarified. "She's receiving medical care. They'll return her home once she recovers."

Michael scoffed. "That's ridiculous!" Then he noticed the bruises on Henry's neck. "Henry! What happened to your neck? Who did this?"

Henry pressed his lips together. His mother had made him promise to leave quickly and never see Dominic again. He wouldn't break that promise.

If Dominic tried to kill him again next time, who would protect Mommy and Lily?

"That bastard Dominic! How dare he strangle you! Don't worry Henry, Evelyn would never choose him after this!" Michael raged.

Henry's eyes reddened. Being nearly killed by his own father had traumatized the five-year-old deeply.

Back in the mansion, Evelyn lay in bed receiving an IV drip.

Dominic sat shrouded in cigarette smoke in the room's corner.

Through the haze, Evelyn studied his blurred profile. After a long silence, she asked hoarsely, "Dominic... have you ever killed someone?"
###Chapter 406

The sole reason Evelyn questioned Dominic was the sheer terror in his eyes when he'd been choking Henry. Just recalling that moment sent shivers down her spine.

She didn't ask why he'd done it because no matter how much Henry provoked him, no adult should ever lay hands on a child!

What kind of monster attacks a five-year-old?

Dominic lifted his gaze to meet Evelyn's.

"Not just that," he rumbled, his voice dark as thunder. "Rape, murder, abduction, theft - I've committed every sin imaginable."

Evelyn's breath caught. His expression was deadly serious. The shock left her speechless, her mind reeling.

"Stop pretending you care about me, Evelyn." He tapped his cigarette absently against the crystal ashtray. "You only care about your precious twins. I warned your son already - don't test my limits," he drawled, each word dripping with menace.

"He won't do it again!" Evelyn's voice cracked, betraying her fear.

Dominic stubbed out his cigarette. Rising from the chair, he stalked toward the hospital bed.

"I owe you nothing, Evelyn. Don't raise your voice at me!" His crimson-rimmed eyes burned with fury. "My patience isn't infinite."

A sharp knock interrupted them. The door swung open.

The nurse entered with a steaming bowl of oatmeal, freezing when she saw Dominic. He snatched the bowl from her trembling hands.

The nurse fled without another word.

Evelyn needed strength to escape. Pushing through the pain, she struggled upright.

When Dominic reached her bedside, she reached for the bowl. She refused to be fed like some invalid.

He ignored her outstretched hand. Scooping a spoonful, he brought it to her lips.

Evelyn stared in disbelief. Hadn't he seen her reaching? She didn't want his help!

Hadn't he just threatened her?

"Open." His gaze locked onto hers, her hatred reflected in his dark eyes.

"You're a demon," she spat, finally seeing his true nature.

"A demon who's taking you straight to hell with me." Without flinching, he pinched her jaw open and forced the spoon between her lips.

He fed her the entire bowl methodically, then dabbed her mouth with a tissue.

Evelyn sat motionless, enduring his twisted "care." To him, she was just another possession to control.

People contained multitudes. Dominic had shown her fleeting kindness, but now she understood - even his tenderness was just another form of manipulation.

Before leaving, Dominic placed her phone on the pillow. The moment the door clicked shut, she grabbed it. Dozens of missed calls flashed across the screen.

She scrolled straight to Michael's number.

"Evelyn!" he answered instantly.

"It's me! Michael, Henry-"

"Henry's safe with me! Just shaken up!" Michael's voice broke with emotion. "I heard about the wolf attack! What kind of insane-"

"Just superficial wounds. I'll heal soon," she brushed off before turning grave. "Michael, you must never let Henry provoke Dominic again! He despises children-"

"Focus on recovering. I've got the kids." Michael's tone hardened. "Are you certain he'll actually let you come home after this?"

Evelyn's lashes fluttered. "I... I think so."

###Chapter 407

"Just focus on recovering. If he doesn't let you go within a week, I'm calling the police again," Michael growled through clenched teeth. "I already know everything."

Evelyn's voice was barely above a whisper. "How did you find out?"

"Nathan told me. He couldn't believe his boss would act like such a monster, so he investigated."

A bitter smile twisted Evelyn's lips.

Michael's tone turned sharp. "Is this because his mother discovered the children's true parentage?"

"Yes."

"I knew it!" His fist pounded against something hard. "You never told him, so he snapped."

Evelyn remained silent.

"You foolish woman! If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't have let fear control me! What's the worst he could do? Kill Lily and Henry? I refuse to believe even Dominic Blackwood would murder his own flesh and blood! Those children owe him nothing!"

"The current situation is manageable," Evelyn countered. "I won't gamble with their lives."

"Fine. But you'll call me daily. If I don't hear from you, consider the police notified." His words carried finality.

"I understand." The call ended, leaving Evelyn marginally calmer.

The past two days had been an unending nightmare. Just as one horror faded, another began.

An hour later, the housekeeper arrived with fresh clothes. "Miss Thorne, Mr. Blackwood purchased these for you." She held up designer labels. "He insisted you be properly dressed."

Evelyn initially resisted, then slowly attempted rising.

"Miss Thorne, Mr. Blackwood instructed me to bathe you. Please remain in bed—"

"No. I'll wash myself." Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Fetch me a cane."

The housekeeper hesitated before leaving, returning not with a cane but with Dominic himself.

"Miss Thorne," the housekeeper fretted, "the doctor said movement could worsen your injury—"

She clearly didn't realize Evelyn was a physician who understood her own prognosis.

Under Dominic's piercing gaze, Evelyn swallowed hard and lay back down.

The housekeeper brought warm water and towels, carefully cleansing Evelyn's skin.

"Miss Thorne, I've prepared clam chowder. Shall I bring some?"

"Secretly," Evelyn whispered. "Don't let him see." The memory of Dominic feeding her made her stomach churn—not from his technique, but from his presence.

"Of course. With tonight's guests, he won't notice."

"Guests again?" Evelyn's voice tightened.

"The same group as last night," the housekeeper admitted after hesitation. "Several ladies too."

Evelyn dismissed the topic. As long as Dominic stayed away from her children, his debauchery meant nothing.

After eating, she fell into fitful sleep.

She hadn't anticipated the nightly parties—music, laughter, clinking glasses.

Each night, the revelry woke her. Each night, she wondered: Hadn't his mother just died?

Was this celebration or self-destruction?

By the third day, her leg pain subsided.

That night, noise startled her awake again. She blinked in the darkness until her door creaked open.

A towering silhouette filled the doorway—familiar, dangerous, reeking of alcohol that permeated the room.

###Chapter 408

The sudden flood of light made Evelyn blink rapidly as Dominic flicked the switch.

His tall frame filled the doorway, his movements sharp as he slammed the door shut behind him.

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat when she saw the dangerous glint in his bloodshot eyes.

The scent of expensive whiskey clung to him as his long fingers worked impatiently at his shirt buttons.

Her pulse skyrocketed when she realized his intentions. The air between them crackled with tension so thick she could barely breathe.

"Dominic! You're in the wrong suite!" Her voice trembled as she tried reasoning with him. "This is my private quarters!"

His predatory gaze never left hers as he stalked toward the bed, discarding his shirt carelessly on the plush carpet.

"I'm perfectly sober." His voice was rough as he climbed onto the mattress and carefully avoided her injured leg. "Keep still."

Her throat went dry. His words rang true - his movements were too precise for someone intoxicated. If he knew about her injury, why was he doing this?

The moment his warm lips grazed her neck, Evelyn caught the overpowering floral perfume clinging to his skin.

Her nose wrinkled in disgust. Just last week, the housekeeper had mentioned the group of socialites staying at Mooncrest Manor for three straight days.

The cloying scent was undoubtedly from one of those women.

Even without his shirt, the fragrance still permeated the air between them.

"Don't!" She shoved at his shoulders with surprising strength. "You reek of another woman!"

Dominic stilled, his dark eyes flashing dangerously.

"You're disgusting!" She spat the words, her hands pressing against his chest. "Get off me!"

The force of her push nearly sent him tumbling off the bed.

Her defiance only seemed to fuel his darker desires.

With one hand braced beside her head, he made quick work of his belt buckle with the other. What had started as simple desire now demanded punishment.

"You called me a monster once," he growled, his breath hot against her ear. "Since when do monsters care about being clean?"

His fingers dug into her chin, forcing her to meet his burning gaze. "I'll take what I want, Evelyn. Always."

Pinned beneath him, she could only turn her face away as silent tears tracked down her cheeks.

"Lights!" She begged hoarsely. "Turn them off!"

The sight of her tears made something in his chest tighten painfully. With a sharp motion, darkness swallowed the room once more.

In the blackness, only their ragged breathing filled the space between them - his heavy with desire, hers shaky with unshed sobs.

When the storm finally passed, Dominic collapsed beside her, his arm possessively circling her waist even in sleep.

Evelyn wiped at her damp cheeks with trembling fingers.

The lingering perfume mixed with sweat and sex made her stomach churn.

A terrifying realization struck her with chilling clarity - she could end this torment forever. Protect her children. Be free.

The thought took root, spreading through her veins like poison.

###Chapter 409 Evelyn reached beneath the pillow and pulled out the gleaming dagger!

Nicholas had given her the weapon when she'd fled for her life. It was meant for protection.

When Dominic had rescued her, the dagger was still clutched in her trembling fingers. He'd tried to take it away, fearing she might harm herself in despair. But Evelyn had insisted on keeping it.

She'd hidden it under her pillow ever since. This blade had saved her once before - it held meaning beyond mere steel.

Never in her darkest moments had she imagined Dominic would humiliate her like this. He'd shattered her dignity completely. In that instant, all rational thought vanished - she wanted him dead, then herself.

She'd kill him first, then end her own life!

As a doctor, she knew exactly where to strike for a quick, painless death.

Evelyn gripped the dagger tightly, scanning his exposed neck in the fading sunset light.

His eyes remained closed in peaceful slumber. The sheets had slipped down, revealing his vulnerable throat.

Her hands shook violently as she raised the blade.

One swift motion, and within thirty minutes, she'd be free forever!

Just as the dagger aligned with his jugular, hesitation gripped her.

Did she truly want this? Did he deserve to die?

Killing him meant her own death too. Could she abandon Lily and Henry like this?

Tears blurred her vision. She didn't want to die. She couldn't kill him, yet couldn't endure his torment either. Maybe just incapacitating him...

But could she disable him without causing fatal damage?

Her breathing came in ragged gasps.

She couldn't do it. Slowly, her arm began to lower.

Then Dominic's eyes snapped open.

He saw the dagger hovering above him. Comprehension dawned instantly.

His hand shot up, seizing her wrist with crushing force.

Evelyn nearly screamed in shock. Her lips moved soundlessly, no explanation forthcoming.

"Trying to kill me?" His voice was raw, trembling with emotion. "Evelyn... you were going to kill me?"

Pain shot through her wrist from his iron grip.

"Dominic, let go!"

"Is this revenge for our son?" He wasn't listening, lost in his own anguish.

There was no point denying it now.

"Yes! I want you dead! I can't take your torture anymore!" The words burst from her like poison being purged.

"Fine... fine..." Dominic muttered darkly. He tightened his grip on her hand and forced the dagger toward his own chest. "Here. Right through the heart!"

His bare chest gleamed in the dim light. The blade's tip pierced skin, drawing a thin line of crimson.

Evelyn sobbed in terror. "Stop! I don't want to kill you! I changed my mind!"

"Afraid I'll haunt you?" He pressed deeper, wincing as blood welled. His voice dropped to a pained whisper. "Don't worry... I won't come looking... Not in this life... or the next..."

Evelyn screamed hysterically, "HELP! SOMEONE HELP!"

###Chapter 410

Evelyn's piercing scream shattered the night's silence, sending the bodyguard stationed outside crashing through the door.

Light flooded the room as it swung open violently.

The bodyguard froze at the horrifying scene before him.

"Doctor! Get the doctor now!" His voice cracked with panic as he sprinted toward the bed.

"Get his hand off! Hurry!" Evelyn sobbed desperately.

At first, the bodyguard assumed Evelyn was attacking Dominic. But to his shock, it took all his strength to pry Dominic's fingers from the dagger's hilt.

The truth was undeniable - Dominic was actively trying to end his own life.

This was a suicide attempt.

As soon as the dagger was wrestled from Dominic's grip, Evelyn scrambled off the bed.

The doctor rushed in with his medical kit, only to have it snatched from his hands.

Evelyn immediately began working to stem the bleeding from Dominic's chest wound.

The doctor stood stunned.

"How is she moving so fast? Weren't her legs injured?" he wondered in disbelief.

"She took my medical supplies!" he realized belatedly, shaking himself into action.

Approaching the bed, the doctor gasped at the sight - the dagger still embedded in Dominic's chest, the sheets soaked crimson.

"Uh...uh...uh!"

The bodyguard grabbed Evelyn's arm, attempting to pull her away, but she shook him off with surprising strength.

"Miss Thorne, are you qualified for this? Don't interfere with proper treatment!" The bodyguard frowned, distrust evident in his voice.

Evelyn's eyes burned red. "I can stop the bleeding!" she rasped.

Her strained voice seemed to rouse Dominic, who coughed weakly as consciousness returned.

Through blurred vision, he saw Evelyn - face streaked with tears, clutching medical supplies with trembling hands.

With what little strength remained, he tried pushing her away. Death was his choice. Life offered only pain. Death meant peace.

"Hold him down! All of you, hold him now!" Evelyn batted away Dominic's hands, shouting through her tears at the bodyguard.

The bodyguard immediately pinned Dominic's arms to the bed.

Enraged, Dominic coughed up blood. "How dare you!"

The bodyguard recoiled in fear, releasing his grip. Evelyn shot him an icy glare. "Do you want him to die? Hold him down!"

Of course the bodyguard didn't want his employer dead. He reluctantly obeyed Evelyn.

"Forgive me, Mr. Blackwood. You're losing too much blood. Let Miss Thorne help you! We'll get you to the hospital immediately after!" the bodyguard pleaded.

Dominic's labored breathing filled the room as he glared at Evelyn with bitter resentment. "Stop your fake tears. My death means your freedom. No one will seek revenge for me."

Ignoring his words, Evelyn grasped the dagger's hilt with both hands.

"Dominic, this will hurt." She met his gaze steadily after taking a deep breath.

Dominic's face had gone ghostly pale from blood loss.

His eyes, though wet with unshed tears, remained cold and hopeless. He would never show weakness, even now.

With gritted teeth, Evelyn yanked the dagger free. Blood sprayed across the sheets.

She immediately applied pressure to the wound. Satisfied when the bleeding slowed, she dressed it efficiently with medication and bandages.

When she finished the emergency treatment, she looked down to find Dominic had lost consciousness.

The formidable man now lay vulnerable, his defenses gone. "Get him to the hospital now!" Evelyn ordered hoarsely, her voice breaking with emotion.

###Chapter 411

The security team and medical staff swiftly escorted Dominic away.

Evelyn curled up on the bloodstained bed, knees drawn to her chest, her sobs echoing through the silent room.

As midnight approached, clarity pierced through her grief. The deafening screams of regret in her heart became unbearable.

The rhythmic thumping of helicopter blades vibrated through the ceiling before fading into the darkness.

Footsteps approached her door. She didn't lift her head. Whoever entered didn't matter anymore.

The visitor draped fresh linens over her trembling shoulders and retrieved the bloodied dagger from the sheets.

"Miss Thorne." Nicholas Vaughn's voice held quiet disappointment. "This blade was meant for protection, not attempted murder. I must reclaim it."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "I wanted to kill him... but I couldn't."

"You might as well have," Nicholas countered calmly, lighting a cigarette. The ember glowed in the dim light. "Provoking him achieved the same result as plunging that dagger into his heart yourself."

His words left her speechless.

"Your mother passed last year, didn't she?" He exhaled a plume of smoke. "Grief makes us fragile. His mother just died. We came to support him, but he asked us to leave tomorrow. Perhaps our presence was too... overwhelming."

Evelyn stared blankly at the crimson stains marring her bedsheets.

"I don't pretend to understand your twisted relationship," Nicholas continued, "but I've never seen him look at another woman. We've introduced stunning socialites - all more beautiful, more curvaceous than you. Yet his eyes only ever sought you. Ask yourself why he kept returning."

Evelyn swallowed hard. "I don't love him anymore."

"Is that so?" Nicholas studied her tear-streaked face. "Then why these tears? He said even death wouldn't trouble you further."

Her silence spoke volumes.

"Don't claim the blood frightened you," he challenged. "You've seen more violence than most soldiers see in a year." Crushing his cigarette, he turned toward the door. "Rest well, Miss Thorne."

After Nicholas departed, the housekeeper entered, shock widening her eyes.

"Miss Thorne... shall I prepare another room? These sheets need changing."

Evelyn's voice emerged hollow. "I'll stay."

As the housekeeper helped her rise, she gasped. "Your leg wound has reopened! The doctor isn't here..."

Evelyn glanced down indifferently. The bandage bloomed red - perhaps his blood, perhaps hers. The pain meant nothing now.

Once fresh linens adorned the bed, Evelyn lay motionless beneath them. The housekeeper switched off the lights as she left.

In the darkness, Evelyn's mind replayed every horrifying moment.

Violence toward others could be blamed on his temper. But self-destruction? That defied explanation.

"Madman," she whispered into the night.

Tears carved silent paths down her cheeks as dawn approached.

A gentle knock announced breakfast. Seeing Evelyn's feigned sleep, the housekeeper retreated with the tray.

Evelyn hadn't slept. Her swollen eyes opened to the morning light. She reached for her phone, desperate for news about Dominic's condition.

Searching "Dominic Blackwood" yielded instant results:

[Blackwood Group CEO Rushed to Hospital Via Helicopter - Critical Condition! (7 Hours Ago)]

[Breaking: Blackwood Group CEO Suffers Cardiac Arrest! Pronounced...]

###Chapter 412 by Midnight Whisper

Evelyn's phone screen illuminated with the breaking news. Her breath hitched violently.

"Dominic... dead?"

Her fingers trembled against the glass. "This can't be real. Not him. Not like this."

She'd stopped the bleeding herself. The medical helicopter had taken him directly to St. Elizabeth Medical Center. Top specialists should've been waiting. How could they fail?

"Did he pull at the bandages mid-flight? Or refuse treatment at the hospital?" The possibilities tormented her.

Hot tears spilled down her cheeks unchecked.

The truth remained - Dominic Blackwood was gone. Truly gone.

Doctors could perform miracles, but not resurrection.

Last night, when rage consumed her, she'd believed his death would bring freedom. So why did this news feel like a knife twisting in her chest?

Online, media outlets exploded with coverage:

[In Memoriam: Dominic Blackwood - The Titan Who Fell]

[Blackwood Group: Who Will Steer the Empire Now?]

[The Tragic End of Dominic Blackwood]

[Conspiracy Theories Surrounding Blackwood's Death]

[Eleanor Blackwood's Passing Preceded Son's - What Fate Awaits the Dynasty?]

Each headline struck like a hammer blow.

Gregory kept dialing Dominic's number, getting only voicemail. How could he verify these claims?

His wife Beatrice practically vibrated with excitement. "Gregory, if your brother's really dead, does that mean we get part of his estate? Didn't you say his will provided for your mother? Now that she's gone..."

Gregory's glare could've melted steel. "My mother just died. Now my brother. And all you care about is money?"

"What else matters? He's dead! I didn't kill him!"

Gregory muttered darkly, "How did this happen?"

"Call Julian home immediately! We need to arrange funerals!"

Unable to bear his wife's avarice, Gregory grabbed his keys and stormed out.

Chaos engulfed Blackwood Group headquarters.

How could their indomitable leader just... die?

Nathan's phone hadn't stopped ringing.

Vincent and Lucas fielded endless calls too. They convened in Dominic's office, faces grim.

"Who spoke with him last?" Lucas demanded.

"Work email two days ago. He read it but didn't reply. No communication since," Vincent reported.

Nathan adjusted his glasses. "Three days back, Michael and Henry went to see him. He was fine then."

"I'll check the hospital. Nathan, find Michael - have him contact Evelyn. Mr. Holloway, call an emergency meeting to stabilize the company." Lucas's voice turned steely. "Until we confirm this, treat all reports as speculation. I refuse to believe he'd go quietly!"

Their plan set, the men dispersed.

Nathan arrived at Mooncrest Manor, ringing the bell repeatedly.

The door finally opened to reveal a bleary-eyed Michael, blond hair disheveled. "What the hell, Nate? It's dawn."

"Call Evelyn now!" Nathan grabbed Michael's arm. "Something's happened to Mr. Blackwood. She'll know the truth."

###Chapter 413

Michael picked up a glass of water, his fingers tightening around it. "What's going on with your boss? You can't just come running to Evelyn every time he's in trouble—"

"He's dead." Nathan's voice cracked.

Michael choked on his water. "Are you joking? You're telling me he's dead? How?"

"I don't know. The internet says he's gone."

Michael was stunned into silence. Seeing Nathan on the verge of breaking down, he slammed the glass onto the table and stormed toward his room.

"Don't panic. Let me call Evelyn. She was on the phone with me last night. She said her injuries weren’t as bad anymore—that she’d be back in a few days. She didn’t mention anything happening to Dominic—"

"It happened early this morning." Nathan followed him, his voice hollow. "We can’t reach him. Or his bodyguard. I’ve worked for him for years. This has never happened before."

Michael grabbed his phone and dialed Evelyn, putting it on speaker before she even answered.

The line rang for what felt like an eternity.

"Evelyn!" Michael’s voice was thick with urgency, mirroring Nathan’s distress. "I heard Dominic’s dead. What happened? Tell me you had nothing to do with this!"

Evelyn lay in bed, staring blankly at the ceiling. Her voice was raw. "I did it."

Michael froze. Nathan’s breath hitched.

"I did it," she repeated, quieter this time.

"Are you—are you okay?" Michael raked a hand through his hair, disbelief twisting his features. "Why? Why would you kill him?"

"I don’t know…" Her voice broke. She had been crying for hours, her throat shredded. "I don’t know how it ended like this—"

"Stop. Just—stop crying. I’m coming to get you right now." Michael snatched a jacket from his closet. "Don’t you dare turn off your phone!"

When the call ended, Nathan stood motionless, his mind numb.

His boss was really gone. And Evelyn had killed him.

A bitter laugh escaped him. "How poetic."

He had always believed that despite their fights, they were meant to be together—that once they worked through their issues, they’d find their way back to each other.

He never imagined tragedy would be their ending.

As Michael shoved his feet into his shoes by the door, he finally registered Nathan’s presence.

"…Nathan. Evelyn messed up. Badly. But I’m still on her side." Michael straightened, meeting Nathan’s gaze. "I’m sorry. If you want to cut ties with me, go ahead."

Without waiting for a response, Michael walked out, not looking back.

He had made his choice long ago—Evelyn came first. No matter what.

Nathan removed his glasses, wiping his eyes. Losing Michael wasn’t the worst part of today.

The worst part was knowing Dominic was dead.

For a while, he just stood there, unsure how to return to the office. When he finally did, he couldn’t bring himself to tell Vincent.

Instead, he called Lucas.

"Did she really say that?" Lucas’s voice was sharp.

"I heard it myself. She admitted it." Nathan’s voice trembled. "I never thought she’d be capable of something like this."

"Stop crying. I’m at the hospital. The latest update is that he’s still in the ER. They’re trying to revive him."

Nathan went still. Then, slowly, he pulled himself together. "Where was he hurt? Why is it this serious?"

"His heart."

Nathan exhaled sharply. "How could she?"

"The bodyguard said Dominic did it to himself." Lucas’s tone was grim. "Even if Evelyn was involved, he wouldn’t blame her."

"That’s what he said?"

"The bodyguard told me. Dominic was unconscious before they even got him to the hospital." Lucas pinched the bridge of his nose. "His estate lawyer just showed up too. The news spread fast."

###Chapter 414 by Silent Echoes

Michael Sterling arrived at Mooncrest Manor.

He slammed the car door shut and marched toward the entrance. Two burly guards immediately blocked his path.

"I'm here for Evelyn Thorne!" Michael declared. "Your employer is dead. You might want to consider whether your paychecks will still clear."

The guards exchanged confused glances.

Inside, the housekeeper was assisting Evelyn down the grand staircase. She was preparing to leave the estate.

Dominic Blackwood was gone. Evelyn needed to see him one final time.

When Michael spotted Evelyn, he shoved past the guards without hesitation.

"Evelyn! I'm taking you home!" Michael practically snatched her from the housekeeper's grasp.

After settling Evelyn into the passenger seat, Michael's eyes dropped to her leg. The loose sweatpairs concealed any visible injuries.

"You were favoring your right side back there. I don't buy that you're fully recovered." His brow furrowed as he started the ignition. "We're going straight to Metropolitan General when we reach the city."

Evelyn clutched the seatbelt with trembling fingers. Her chest felt hollow.

"Evelyn... His lawyers... They won't come after you, will they?" Michael hesitated before asking, his voice uncharacteristically soft.

Michael had always despised Dominic for how he'd treated Evelyn and the twins.

While part of him pitied the man's demise, his primary concern remained Evelyn. He prayed Dominic's death wouldn't bring legal repercussions crashing down on her.

"I don't know." Her voice was barely audible. At this moment, potential lawsuits were the least of her worries.

"What... happened between you two?" Michael kept his tone gentle, aware of the delicate nature of the question.

"I don't know." The weight of memories pressed down on her. Just thinking about Dominic made breathing difficult.

"Did you sleep at all?" Michael noted her swollen, bloodshot eyes. "Rest now. The twins need you strong. I'll retain the best legal team money can buy. You focus on healing."

Evelyn closed her eyes. Dominic's pained, hate-filled gaze haunted her. His final words echoed - he wouldn't seek her out in any future life.

They'd hurt each other beyond repair. Why else would he have plunged that dagger into his own chest?

Death was preferable to seeing her face again.

At Mooncrest Academy during recess, Henry pulled Lily aside.

"The bastard's dead." Henry had seen the news alert and needed to tell his sister.

Lily's eyes widened. "Which one? Julian... or Dominic?"

"Dominic," Henry admitted awkwardly, the name tasting bitter on his tongue.

Lily's initial shock faded. Despite hating their biological father, his death still struck a chord.

"How?" she wondered aloud.

"Henry, is this real? You're not lying?" Lily's eyes welled up, her nose turning pink.

Henry nodded solemnly.

"Waaah... He's gone. Mommy's safe now... So why does this hurt?" Lily swiped at her tears. "I shouldn't feel sad, right?"

Henry shrugged. "Feel whatever you need to feel."

"Are you sad?" Lily studied her brother through watery eyes.

The fading bruise on Henry's neck served as a painful reminder. Even if he grieved, he'd never show it.

"Nope."

"Oh... Then... Should we visit his grave?" Lily suddenly asked. After Grandma Clara died, Mommy often took them to pay respects.

###Chapter 415 If their Father was Gone, Would They Need to Visit His Grave?

"Go if you want. I'm not going," Henry said icily before storming back to his bedroom.

"Henry, waaah... I miss Mommy. When is she coming home?" Lily chased after him desperately, clinging to his sleeve like a lifeline.

"She'll be back soon." Henry's voice held an eerie certainty.

Dominic was dead. His mother had nothing left to fear now.

Michael drove Evelyn to St. Elizabeth Medical Center, transferring her care to Wesley.

"Which hospital is he at?" Evelyn's voice was barely audible when she saw Wesley.

"Metropolitan General. Latest update is they're still performing CPR," Wesley answered gently. "Don't panic."

He helped her onto the examination table.

Minutes later, clarity returned to Evelyn's eyes. "Wesley... did you say he's alive?"

Wesley exhaled heavily. "Cardiac arrest, but they revived him. The battle's still ongoing."

Evelyn released a shuddering breath.

Wesley wheeled her to the trauma bay. Scissors flashed as he cut away her blood-soaked pants.

The bandage beneath was crimson.

"Evelyn, how did this happen? You were supposed to be resting!" Wesley's brow furrowed as he peeled back the gauze with clinical precision.

"It doesn't hurt much," she murmured.

"That's not the point! This level of neglect risks serious infection!" Wesley's tone sharpened. "Thank God Michael found you."

Meanwhile, Michael stood at the entrance, dialing Nathan repeatedly.

He needed to update him about Dominic's condition, but all calls went straight to voicemail.

"That bastard blocked me!" Michael snarled, shoving his phone away before returning to the ER.

His breath caught seeing Evelyn's injuries. "Jesus Christ, Evelyn! Are you trying to lose the damn leg?"

Michael's outburst sparked a flicker of emotion in Evelyn's exhausted eyes.

"Stop yelling."

"Look at this mess! What am I supposed to do, applaud?" Michael raked a hand through his hair. "Wes, will she recover?"

Wesley shook his head. "The laceration's extensive. Significant scarring is inevitable."

"Scars we can handle. Just no amputations." Michael watched Wesley clean the wound. "Hospital stay required?"

"Advisable, but not mandatory. I can do home visits for dressing changes," Wesley offered, meeting Evelyn's gaze. "You'd recover better at Mooncrest Manor. The children miss you terribly."

Evelyn nodded weakly.

Exhaustion dragged at her eyelids. Forty-eight hours without sleep, constant terror, and now this fragile hope about Dominic - her body surrendered to oblivion.

As Wesley finished bandaging, Evelyn succumbed to sleep. Michael tucked the blanket around her shoulders.

Wesley prepared IV antibiotics and anti-inflammatories.

"Go handle your business, Michael. I'll get her home when she wakes," Wesley assured.

"Right. I'll check on Dominic at Metropolitan General. Not that I care, but Evelyn clearly does."

Wesley nodded.

"Give it up, doc," Michael added with uncharacteristic gentleness. "Even if things end with Dominic, you're not her type. Don't waste your life waiting." Wesley flushed. "I know. I never expected anything."

At Metropolitan General, after twelve hours of resuscitation efforts, Dominic was transferred to ICU.

One week. That's how long he needed to survive before doctors would declare him out of danger.

As night fell, Lucas took Dominic's estate attorney to dinner.

The attorney declined.

"Relax," Lucas said smoothly. "I'm not fishing for inheritance details. I already know how it's structured."

###Chapter 416

The estate attorney studied Lucas's confident demeanor. "After Mrs. Blackwood's passing," he revealed, "Mr. Blackwood instructed me to modify certain arrangements."

Lucas raised an eyebrow. "Is that so?"

"I must decline any refreshments," the attorney continued. "Should there be any change in Mr. Blackwood's condition, please notify me immediately."

"Understood," Lucas replied smoothly. "Let me walk you out."

After seeing the attorney off, Lucas checked his watch. The evening had slipped away unnoticed - the clock now showed seven.

Evelyn finally stirred from her deep slumber, her mind still foggy with sleep.

"Evelyn! Time to go home!" Michael's voice cut through her haze. "I just returned from Metropolitan General. Dominic's alive - moved to ICU. Those vultures in the media declared him dead prematurely!"

Michael helped her sit up. Evelyn's awareness sharpened faster than expected.

"What time is it?"

"Nearly eight," Michael answered, guiding her into the wheelchair. "Hungry?"

Evelyn nodded.

Proper meals had become rare these past days. All she craved now was decent food, a hot shower, and uninterrupted sleep.

The persistent dizziness reminded her of countless sleepless nights. Rest had become her most urgent need.

"Home-cooked meal awaits! The children heard you're back - they're waiting eagerly!" Michael lifted her into the car, stowing the wheelchair in the trunk.

Thirty minutes later, their car glided through Mooncrest Manor's gates.

Evelyn gazed at the familiar surroundings, emotions swelling. A mere week's absence felt like returning from the dead.

Entering the house, she steadied her scattered thoughts.

Two small figures launched themselves at her.

"Mommy!"

"Mommy!"

Evelyn's heart swelled with bittersweet joy at seeing Lily and Henry.

"I missed you both so much."

"Mommy, we missed you too! Does your leg hurt bad?" Lily examined the injury with concern.

"Which leg is hurt, Mommy?" Henry asked.

"The right one," Evelyn answered.

"Rest at home, Mommy. No walking! It'll get better soon," Lily advised sweetly.

Evelyn smiled. "I'll stay right here."

For the following week, Evelyn remained bedridden.

Michael offered to stay, but she insisted he return to work.

Daily, the bodyguard handled school runs, groceries, and meals while Wesley came each afternoon to change dressings.

After seven days, her leg showed remarkable improvement. She could finally move about the garden.

Summer arrived abruptly. Dominic remained hospitalized - a week in ICU before transfer to specialized care.

When his eyes finally opened, white walls greeted him. His mind felt terrifyingly blank.

"Dominic! You're awake!" Zoe's voice trembled with emotion. "How do you feel?"

Dominic turned his head slightly, recognizing Zoe Montgomery.

"I'll fetch the doctor," Zoe said, eyes glistening as she hurried out.

"Patient? Sick?" he wondered. Attempting to lift his arm proved futile - his body refused to obey.

Zoe's departure brought Lucas's entrance. "Thank God you're awake." His expression mixed relief and strain. "I nearly dissolved Blackwood Group thinking we'd lost you."

Dominic's face remained impassive.

"Whatever happened before - let it go. Your mother would be devastated seeing you like this. If not for her, live for Sophia. She hasn't attended Willowbrook Academy lately - we feared schoolyard rumors. She still doesn't know about the accident."

###Chapter 417

Lucas stood by the hospital bed, his voice low but firm.

Dominic's face remained blank, his expression unreadable despite Lucas's words.

Lucas spoke the truth. Dominic wanted to die. What was left for him to hold onto?

If he were gone, someone would still take care of Sophia.

Moments later, the doctor arrived. After examining Dominic, he said, "Mr. Blackwood, your condition is critical."

"You need to remain hospitalized for recovery. If you experience any discomfort, notify me immediately."

Dominic closed his eyes, shutting out the world.

Lucas pulled the doctor aside.

"Is he in immediate danger?" Lucas asked.

The doctor sighed. "Not if he cooperates with treatment. But his will to live is gone. That’s the real concern."

Lucas pressed his lips together. "I'll handle it."

An hour later, Lucas returned with Sophia.

"Sophia, your brother is badly hurt. Can you comfort him?"

She blinked, her brows knitting together. "Why is he hurt?"

"Love wounded him," Lucas said simply.

Sophia tilted her head. "What does that mean?"

"It means… Dominic fought with Evelyn. Badly." Lucas kept his explanation plain.

"Now he doesn’t want to live anymore. Your job is to make sure he doesn’t give up."

Sophia hesitated. "Why not call Evelyn? He won’t listen to me."

Lucas shook his head. "They’re done. He doesn’t want to see her. Don’t reach out to her either."

Sophia bit her lip. "Does that mean I can’t see Lily and Henry anymore?"

"Your brother is dying, and you’re worried about them?" Lucas snapped.

Sophia’s eyes widened. "Fine! How do I stop him?"

Lucas exhaled. "Just stay with him. Don’t leave his side."

"Okay."

When Dominic woke, Sophia’s face was the first thing he saw.

She sat beside him, her large, innocent eyes brimming with worry.

"Big Brother," she whispered, her voice trembling. "Don’t die. What will happen to me if you’re gone?"

Her small hands clutched his. "If you want to die, take me with you. I don’t want to be alone."

Tears welled in her eyes. "No one loves me like you do. I don’t need anything else. Just you."

Dominic’s breath hitched.

He and Sophia were the same. She was the only one who truly loved him.

She squeezed his hand. "Your hands are so cold. Let me warm them."

Four days later, Dominic was discharged.

That same day, every major news outlet in Eldermere issued public apologies.

Evelyn saw the notification on her phone. Relief washed over her.

Dominic was alive. He was starting over.

So would she.

She prayed they’d never cross paths again. No more pain.

Her phone rang.

Sophie’s name flashed on the screen.

"Evelyn! Dominic’s out of the hospital!" Sophie’s voice was cautious, as if afraid to trigger her.

Adrian had warned her—Evelyn was the one who had nearly killed Dominic.

"I saw the news," Evelyn replied, her tone flat.

"Ugh, those vultures will do anything for clicks," Sophie muttered, changing the subject. "Adrian just heard from him. He won’t be at our wedding. Probably avoiding you."

###Chapter 418

Sophie was terrified Evelyn might misinterpret her intentions. She quickly clarified, "Evelyn, if he refuses to come, that's his choice. But you must attend! You're my closest friend. Without you there, I won't go through with the wedding."

"I'll be there," Evelyn assured her. Sophie exhaled in relief. "Perfect! I heard about your leg injury. How is it? I wanted to reach out sooner, but Dominic was still recovering, and I worried you might not be in the right headspace."

"My leg's improving."

"Thank goodness! Let's go shopping tomorrow!"

Evelyn examined her uncovered wound. Though no longer bandaged, the scar remained visibly angry. "It hasn't healed completely yet."

Fortunately, her wardrobe contained numerous long skirts to conceal the mark.

"Then I'll visit you tomorrow. Don't worry - I won't mention Dominic at all," Sophie promised firmly.

"Alright."

The following morning, Sophie arrived before the twins left for preschool. She carried overflowing bags - fruits, snacks, toys, new outfits, and an enormous breakfast spread.

Evelyn gaped. "Sophie, this is too much! Lily told me you visited daily while I was gone, bringing gifts each time."

"My pleasure!" Sophie handed over the breakfast before lifting Evelyn's skirt hem. "Good heavens! That's horrific!"

"It doesn't hurt much anymore."

"What kind of relationship ends like this?" Sophie muttered before changing subjects. She distributed toys to the children. "Off to school?"

"Aunt Sophie, I wish you'd marry today so I could skip," Lily pouted, dragging her backpack reluctantly.

"Sweetheart, why avoid school?"

"I want to stay home with Mommy," Lily confessed.

"Lily, I'm returning to work tomorrow," Evelyn reminded.

"Exactly why I want today off! With you and Aunt Sophie here, please let me stay!" Lily begged with puppy-dog eyes.

Before Evelyn could respond, Sophie snatched the backpack away. "Done! One missed day won't hurt. Preschool isn't like proper school yet."

She shot Evelyn a meaningful look. "If I ever have kids, you'll spoil them rotten," Evelyn sighed.

"When your mom returns to work, you'll go back to school," Sophie cooed, cuddling Lily. "If I had a daughter this adorable, I'd hire private tutors! Couldn't bear sending her away."

"I'm only saying this because I'm free to indulge them. You're a career woman!" Sophie added hastily. "Though socialization before elementary school is important..."

Evelyn sipped water thoughtfully. "Sophie, stop walking on eggshells. It's unlike you."

Sophie arched a brow. "Then what happened with Dominic?"

Evelyn froze.

"You told me not to tiptoe," Sophie pointed out. "But I can guess - couples' fights are deadly serious."

Evelyn shook her head. "Stop speculating. Someone's at the door."

The children and Sophie perked up.

"Who is it?" Michael emerged from his room - wearing only boxer shorts. Sophie lunged, shoving him back inside.

"Have some decency! Don't corrupt innocent Lily's eyes! How many times must I remind you?" she scolded.

Michael rolled his eyes. "Aren't you modern women supposed to appreciate good physiques? This is art!"

"Put on clothes!" Sophie slammed the door behind him.

###Chapter 419

The moment Evelyn had been anticipating finally arrived.

A sleek black limousine pulled up at the entrance.

Two broad-shouldered bodyguards stepped out first, scanning the surroundings with practiced efficiency. Sophie watched the scene unfold from the window.

"Who on earth is this? Why do they need such heavy security?" Sophie gasped, her fingers gripping the windowsill.

Evelyn rose from the couch. As she passed Sophie, she murmured, "Eric Montclair."

After months of intensive rehabilitation, the former superstar had regained his ability to walk. Today, he'd come with his family to personally thank Evelyn for saving his career.

Eric wore dark athletic wear with a baseball cap pulled low. A medical mask and sunglasses completed his disguise, making facial recognition impossible. Yet even concealed, his commanding presence and perfect posture turned heads. He moved with the effortless grace of a panther.

"Evelyn, I swear I'm going to scream!" Sophie vibrated with barely contained excitement.

"Please don't," Evelyn warned. "The neighbors will think we're being robbed."

Sophie bit her fist instead.

The entourage entered the living room under the watchful eyes of security. Without removing his disguise, Eric suddenly pulled Evelyn into a warm embrace.

"Dr. Thorne, I owe you everything."

Evelyn stiffened in surprise. "Just Evelyn is fine."

"Evelyn...thank you." Releasing her, Eric finally removed his cap, mask, and glasses.

Golden afternoon light illuminated his sculpted features - high cheekbones, flawless skin, and those famous ice-blue eyes that had launched a thousand magazine covers. The room collectively held its breath. Photos didn't do justice to his otherworldly beauty.

Lily's jaw dropped. She stuffed both fists in her mouth to contain her squeal. This man was even more gorgeous than her stupid father! No—they weren't even comparable! Eric was exactly her type - youthful perfection.

"Mister!" Lily suddenly dashed forward with uncharacteristic boldness. "I'm Lily! Evelyn's favorite daughter! I think you're amazing!"

Eric blinked in surprise before gently scooping the giggling girl into his arms.

Henry, embarrassed by his sister's antics, retreated to his room. Michael had just finished dressing when he saw Lily in Eric's embrace. An unfamiliar pang of jealousy twisted in his chest.

"Evelyn," Eric began, still holding the beaming Lily, "I came today not just to thank you." His piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn's. "I'm returning to the stage."

Sophie shrieked.

Eric turned his attention to her.

"I'm Evelyn's best friend!" Sophie blurted. "And—and your biggest fan!"

Eric's famous smile lit up the room. "I brought an advance copy of my new single. I'd value your feedback."

Sophie looked ready to faint. Michael caught her just as her knees buckled.

"Evelyn," Michael interjected, steadying Sophie, "I need to head to work. We're conducting employee physicals this afternoon. I'll come back to get you—you're required to participate too."

###Chapter 420

At noon, Eric had lunch at Evelyn’s before leaving.

"Evelyn, go rest up before your physical this afternoon. I’ll take the kids out for some fun. How does that sound?" Sophie had noticed the gorgeous weather and didn’t want to waste it indoors. "I’ll have them back by six."

Evelyn saw the excitement in the children’s eyes and couldn’t refuse.

"Sophie, are you sure it won’t be too much trouble?"

Sophie waved her off. "They’re not toddlers anymore. It’s not like I have to carry them. Taking them out is actually fun!"

Evelyn made sure a bodyguard accompanied them. After they left, she closed the front door and exhaled.

A pristine white box sat on the coffee table—Eric’s parting gift. He’d called it his lucky charm. Nothing extravagant, just something meaningful.

She couldn’t bring herself to refuse.

Carrying the box to her room, she sat on the edge of her bed just as Michael called.

"Evelyn, I’ll pick you up in two hours. Get some rest." Then, with a teasing lilt, he added, "Is that pretty boy gone yet? If not, it’s time to kick him out, don’t you think?"

"Don’t call him that. He’s a genuine artist. I heard his new song today—it’s incredible," Evelyn said honestly. "I’ve never been one to follow celebrities, but his talent is magnetic. I’m officially a fan."

Michael groaned. "Ugh, don’t tell me you’re falling for him!"

"It’s admiration."

"Right, admiration. But honestly, if you ended up with him, I wouldn’t complain. When it comes to partners, you either want someone rich, handsome, or talented. Eric ticks two of those boxes. I’ll admit, he’s easy on the eyes."

"If you’re done, I’m hanging up." Evelyn had no interest in continuing this conversation.

After ending things with Dominic, she had no intention of diving into another relationship.

They drained too much energy. She was done with them.

Evelyn set her phone aside and opened the white box. Inside lay an intricately designed necklace.

The pendant was a ring, engraved with symbols in a language she didn’t recognize.

She placed it back in the box and lay down. Despite getting plenty of sleep lately, she wasn’t tired.

Gazing out the window, she watched the sunlight filter through the trees and the occasional bird flit by. A rare tranquility settled over her.

For the first time in ages, her mind wasn’t consumed by thoughts of Dominic or their past. She hadn’t planned her future either. This peace was unfamiliar—but she liked it.

She hoped it would last.

Two hours later, Michael arrived to take her to the hospital. Seeing her colleagues after so long stirred emotions. They bombarded her with questions about her "vacation."

Evelyn shot Michael a look. He leaned in and whispered, "I couldn’t exactly tell them Dominic kidnapped you. How embarrassing would that be? I said you went on a trip."

"You could’ve warned me. I didn’t bring any gifts."

"You’re not officially back until tomorrow. After your checkup, we’ll go shopping."

Evelyn sighed in relief.

After the examinations, they left the hospital.

"Let me drop you off first. Just tell me what you need, and I’ll handle the shopping," Michael offered, concerned about her stamina.

###Chapter 421

Evelyn shook her head. "I need some fresh air."

"Then tell me immediately if your leg starts hurting. Don't push yourself."

"I know."

"Evelyn, if I'd known how much trouble we'd face coming back to this country, I never would've let you return." Michael helped her into the car. "Back in Stonebridge, everything was peaceful. I never had to worry about you. Who knew your homecoming would turn into a never-ending nightmare for me?"

Guilt flickered in Evelyn's eyes. "Then why don't you go back to Stonebridge?"

"That's not what I meant!"

"I know. But I can handle things here. You should go back—"

"Only if you come with me."

"No. I love my country more than I ever loved Stonebridge."

Michael scoffed. "Then I'm staying too. Where you go, I go."

"You miss Nathan, don't you?"

"Why bring him up? He blocked my number." Michael hit the accelerator. "That bastard only cares about his boss."

Evelyn sighed. "I'm sorry."

"Why are you apologizing? Even without you, we'd still have this problem. I won't tolerate being second to his damn job."

They headed to the mall. Evelyn bought imported chocolates and then stopped at a jewelry boutique, picking out gold zodiac bracelets for each of her female employees.

"Evelyn, you're making this harder than it needs to be. Now you have to remember all their birthdays," Michael teased.

"But they'll love it," she insisted.

"They'd love cash more."

"Maybe, but some happiness isn't bought with money."

Like the gift Eric had given her. No amount of money could compare to the joy it brought.

After shopping, Michael carried the bags in one hand and steadied Evelyn with the other.

Her injured leg soon ached.

"I told you I should've gone alone. You never listen," he grumbled.

Evelyn tuned him out.

The next morning, Michael drove her to work. After handing out the gifts, Evelyn returned to her office for the first time in weeks.

A bouquet sat on her desk. She picked up the card.

Today is a beautiful day!

Signed with a single letter—E.

Eric Montclair.

She smiled, settling into her chair and turning on her computer.

A mountain of work awaited her. Though most had been handled, she spent the morning reviewing everything.

At noon, Michael knocked. "Lunch?"

"Did you check your medical results? They're in your email," he reminded her.

She nodded, standing. "Just got them. Haven’t looked yet. How were yours?"

"Doctors said no alcohol for now." He groaned. "What’s the point of living?"

"Listen to them. I’ll make sure you do." She tapped her phone, scanning the report.

Michael pressed the elevator button.

The doors opened.

Then she saw it.

Early Pregnancy: Three Months.

###Chapter 422 Evelyn Was Pregnant!

The medical report confirmed it. She had conceived the night Dominic plunged that dagger into his own heart.

The irony was almost too much to bear. They were completely estranged now, yet she carried his child. Evelyn couldn't find words to describe the shock coursing through her veins. It brought back memories of when she'd been pregnant with Henry and Lily. That same crushing heartache resurfaced.

Back then, Dominic had been fighting tooth and nail for a divorce. Now everything was different. She was financially independent. More than capable of raising children alone. One, two, even three - it didn't matter. She could handle them all.

But should she tell him?

After all, when Zoe had miscarried, he'd blamed Evelyn entirely, demanding she give him another child as compensation. Though they hadn't spoken in months, what if he came after her for not fulfilling that demand?

Michael noticed her panic from the corner of his eye. He closed the distance between them in two strides, trying to glimpse her phone screen.

Evelyn hit the power button instantly, plunging the screen into darkness.

"Something wrong with your test results? You look like you've seen a ghost." Michael reached for her phone, but she twisted away.

"It's nothing... just mild anemia." The lie slipped out easily. "Actually, I have an appointment this afternoon. Won't be back in the office."

She needed to get to another hospital. Had to confirm these results were accurate.

Michael's eyebrows knitted together. "What's really going on?"

"Personal matter. Stop being so nosy. I don't pry into your private life."

"I don't hide anything from you!"

"Well I do. So drop it for now," Evelyn said firmly.

"Then when will you tell me?"

The elevator doors slid open. Evelyn stepped out without looking back.

"When I'm ready."

Michael called after her, "Evelyn, are you going to see Dominic behind my back? Don't be stupid! He stabbed himself this time - next time it'll be you!"

His words sent an icy numbness through her skull.

"I'm not seeing him."

"Good! As long as you're staying away from that psycho, I don't care what else you're doing," Michael huffed.

Evelyn tossed over her shoulder, "Even if I was going to see him, you couldn't stop me."

Michael's frown deepened.

"Relax, I'm joking." She tugged playfully at his sleeve. "Lunch? Let's get something light. Did the doctors ground you from drinking because of stomach or liver problems?"

The distraction worked perfectly.

"My body's in perfect shape!" Michael protested.

"Oh really? Let's hit the bar then."

He caved immediately. "Stomach issues. Just minor ones. Half the office has them."

"Don't take stomach problems lightly." Evelyn's expression turned serious. She tilted her head up to meet his gaze. "No more drinking. Not even occasionally. Understood?"

"Fine, fine! Where are you going this afternoon? I'll drive you."

"No need. I'll take a cab."

Michael finally stopped pressing.

After lunch, they parted ways. Evelyn slid into a taxi and gave the driver directions to the nearest hospital.

Then she reopened the medical report, studying it carefully.

The pregnancy had been detected through bloodwork. The results were likely accurate - unless there'd been a mix-up with the samples. But with modern medical protocols, such mistakes were rare. Unless... someone had tampered with them deliberately. Evelyn gasped, pressing both palms against her still-flat abdomen.

###Chapter 423

A tiny life was blossoming inside Evelyn. Yet, she felt nothing—no telltale signs, no early warnings.

When she had carried Lily and Henry, the symptoms had been unmistakable.

The realization hit her like a cold wave.

Back then, she had been drowning in despair. Wounded, medicated, pumped full of antibiotics.

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. The thought alone made her chest tighten painfully.

Even if this child survived, what if it wasn’t healthy?

The taxi pulled up to the hospital entrance.

She paid the driver and stepped out, the weight of uncertainty pressing down on her.

At the gynecology department, she explained her concerns to the doctor. An ultrasound was ordered.

Forty agonizing minutes later, the results were in her hands.

Pregnant. Again. Dominic’s child.

Too early to tell if it was healthy. Too early to know if it would survive.

If it wasn’t healthy… nature would take its course. She wouldn’t have to wait three months for a miscarriage.

But what if the damage only showed later?

Her mind spun. What was she supposed to do?

If Dominic didn’t want this child, she could terminate it. The risks were too high.

But she wouldn’t decide yet. Not until she knew for sure.

Should she tell him now?

Standing on the sidewalk, Evelyn watched the cars blur past. Lost.

At Thornfield Industries, Michael Sterling studied the business card in his hand, then the man across from him.

"You’re Eric Montclair’s manager?"

"Yes. He sent me to discuss a collaboration." The manager leaned forward. "His new single, Fly, was meant for an online release. With his fanbase, it would’ve been an instant hit. But he insisted on giving it to Thornfield Industries."

Michael frowned. "Giving it?"

"He wrote it for your company. It could be a product anthem—the lyrics align perfectly with your brand."

Michael tapped the card against his palm. "Haven’t heard it yet. Is it any good?"

The manager stiffened.

"Has he spoken to Evelyn?" Michael asked. "She’s the one who makes these calls."

"Miss Thorne loves the song. But she might refuse it as a gift."

"Then we’ll pay. Call it a collaboration." Michael wasn’t fixated on the song’s quality anymore—Eric’s fame was the real asset.

The manager hesitated. "Eric won’t accept payment."

"Then name a friendship price," Michael countered. "Otherwise, Evelyn won’t take it."

"Fine." The manager sighed. "But you should know—Marvel Tech is gaining ground fast. They’ve signed A-list endorsers, flooded social media with influencers. Their sales are skyrocketing. Why isn’t Thornfield doing any promotions?"

Michael smirked. "So Eric’s pitying us?"

The manager shrugged. "Seems like he cares more about your growth than you do."

Michael’s opinion of Eric shifted instantly. The pretty-boy idol had brains, too.

Next time Eric visited Evelyn, Michael would personally hold the door open.

By five p.m., Evelyn stood outside Dominic’s mansion, her resolve hardening.

She had wavered all afternoon. But this child was his too.

He had wanted it.

Now, he would know.

###Chapter 424 by Silent Echo

The guard blinked twice when he spotted Evelyn standing outside the gates. His hands trembled slightly on the security monitor controls. After that explosive fight with Dominic, how could she possibly show up here?

Normally, he would've buzzed her in immediately. Today, his finger hovered uncertainly over the access button.

He reached for the house intercom instead. Mrs. Wilkins answered on the third ring.

"Evelyn Thorne is at the main gate," the guard reported, voice tight with tension.

A sharp intake of breath crackled through the speaker. "I'll handle this." The intercom clicked off.

The sky had been clear when Evelyn arrived. Now dark clouds gathered ominously overhead.

Mrs. Wilkins emerged without opening the gate. Her expression turned stormy when she saw Evelyn's pale face.

"Evelyn," she said coldly. "Are you here to see Mr. Blackwood?" The housekeeper's tone made it clear she knew exactly who'd put Dominic in the hospital. Any sympathy she might have felt had evaporated.

Dominic had nearly died. He wouldn't want to see the woman responsible.

Evelyn nodded stiffly. "Is he home?"

"He is. The doctors ordered complete bed rest for at least four weeks after his discharge." Mrs. Wilkins crossed her arms. "They were very specific about minimizing disturbances."

Evelyn swallowed hard. "I need to speak with him."

"About what?" The housekeeper's voice turned sharp. "Unless it's life-or-death, I can't—"

"I understand." Evelyn cut her off. The pregnancy test burned in her pocket. But Dominic needed recovery time more than he needed this complication.

Mrs. Wilkins softened slightly at the despair in Evelyn's eyes. "Even if I asked him, I doubt he'd agree to see you."

Evelyn's shoulders slumped. "I'm not blaming you."

After a long pause, the housekeeper sighed. "Wait here. I'll check—"

"No." Evelyn straightened abruptly. "Let him rest." Agitation could jeopardize his recovery.

The baby's viability wouldn't be confirmed for weeks anyway. She could wait.

She turned to leave just as the first raindrops fell.

Mrs. Wilkins hurried back inside, returning moments later with a large umbrella. Evelyn was already halfway down the driveway.

"Evelyn!" The housekeeper rushed after her. "Take this at least!"

Evelyn paused, only then noticing the rain soaking through her blouse. She glanced up at the weeping sky.

"It's fine." She waved off the offered umbrella. Accepting it would mean returning later—another painful encounter she couldn't bear.

She'd come in a haze of shock after the positive test. But after everything, maybe Dominic wouldn't even care about the pregnancy. To him, she was already dead.

Evelyn quickened her pace, vanishing into the downpour. Mrs. Wilkins watched her go, the unused umbrella dripping in her hand.

On the mansion's upper balcony, Dominic stood perfectly still. His knuckles whitened on the railing as Evelyn disappeared down the street.

Why had she come? The question sliced through him with fresh pain.

###Chapter 425

Dominic could function like any normal person—eat, sleep, work—as long as he didn't see or think about Evelyn.

But the moment her image crossed his mind, his body betrayed him with physical reactions.

A sharp knock interrupted his thoughts. Dominic stepped inside from the balcony.

He opened the door to find Mrs. Wilkins waiting.

"Sir, Evelyn stopped by earlier. She asked for you," the housekeeper reported. "I inquired about her business, but she didn't say. She left shortly after."

"I saw." Dominic's expression remained impassive, his voice icy.

"Shall I invite her in next time she visits?" Mrs. Wilkins ventured.

"No." After a weighted pause, he muttered the refusal.

——

Evelyn returned home soaked to the bone.

"Mommy! You're all wet!" Lily cried, rushing forward with concern. "Where's your umbrella?"

Michael immediately nudged her toward the stairs. "Go shower before you catch pneumonia."

As Evelyn ascended, Lily turned accusing eyes on Michael. "Why did you let Mommy come home alone like this?"

Henry mirrored his sister's disapproving glare.

Cornered by the children's united front, Michael raised his hands in surrender. "Your mom insisted on handling something alone this afternoon! Threatened to hex me if I followed! I'll make her ginger tea—that'll prevent any cold!" He fled to the kitchen.

After showering and drying her hair, Evelyn descended to find Michael thrusting a steaming mug into her hands. She drained it with murmured thanks.

"Where were you this afternoon?" Michael scolded. "Rain's one thing, but did you forget how to use doorways?"

Lily instantly jumped to her mother's defense. "Stop nagging! Can't you see she's already miserable?"

"Fine, let's eat." Michael herded the children toward the dining table. "Evelyn, our new bodyguard's a culinary genius. Give the man a raise!"

Evelyn surveyed the lavish spread and nodded absently.

"Eat more meat—doctor's orders for your anemia," Michael insisted, piling her plate.

Human psychology worked in strange ways. The ham sandwich she'd eaten that morning hadn't triggered any nausea.

But now, with pregnancy confirmation fresh in her mind, the sight of rich foods turned her stomach.

Noticing her untouched plate, Michael served her pork. She forced one bite before pushing it away. "Some vegetables would be nice."

"I'll have him prepare greens tomorrow." Michael studied Evelyn's downcast expression, correctly guessing her afternoon visit to Dominic's. Before noon, she'd been fine.

"Eric's manager came by earlier," he mentioned casually. "Since you were out, I handled the discussion."

"Reach an agreement?" She arched a brow.

"Nearly. Just needs your final approval." Michael grinned. "Gotta admit, Eric's grown on me. Might stop calling him 'Pretty Boy.'"

"Proceed with your terms then." Evelyn showed no inclination to interfere.

"Thought you hated marketing?"

"Nothing's absolute." She set down her fork, appetite gone. "I've been monitoring Thornfield Industries' aggressive product campaigns. Their numbers don't lie. Eric's offering help—I'd be foolish to refuse."

"Now that's the spirit!"

"I won't let Margaret outmaneuver me." Evelyn rose abruptly. "I'll draft a proposal to discuss with Eric."

"At least finish eating!" Michael protested, eyeing her half-full plate.

"Not hungry. I'll fix something later if I am." She disappeared upstairs.

Seated at her laptop, Evelyn worked mechanically as rain lashed the windows.

Distracted, she finished her tasks and jerked upright, startled to find it nearly eleven.

Despite the late hour, she knew what she had to do—and it couldn't wait until morning.

###Chapter 426 by Silent Echoes

Evelyn's hands trembled as they rested on her abdomen. The life growing inside her filled her with both wonder and dread. Until she could confirm the baby's health, she wouldn't find peace.

She grabbed a raincoat and umbrella, stepping into the spring shower without hesitation.

Three blocks from Mooncrest Manor stood a 24-hour pharmacy.

The bell chimed as she entered, purchasing prenatal vitamins that she tucked into her pocket. The rhythmic patter of rain against her umbrella created a soothing melody.

Though the downpour was heavy, the April air carried warmth. Spring symbolized rebirth, and Evelyn clung to that hope. She prayed this child would be as healthy as Lily and Henry. That was all that mattered now.

Dominic's opinion had become irrelevant.

The rain had washed away her illusions that night. Their lives ran on separate tracks now. She only needed to live truthfully, without regrets.

Returning home, she shook out her umbrella before hearing raised voices in the living room.

"You're choking me!" Nathan's indignant shout cut through the air.

Michael growled, "Keep your voice down! You'll wake Evelyn!"

Nathan's breathing came in ragged bursts. "Why drag me here? Take me home!"

Michael slumped onto the couch, rubbing his temples. "I've been drinking, idiot. You're staying put tonight."

"You expect me to sleep on this couch?!"

"Better than the floor!" Michael shot back. "Unless you'd prefer my bed?"

"Are you insane? What if Evelyn or the kids see me? How would I explain this?" Nathan struggled upright, staggering toward Michael's bedroom.

Michael followed, lowering his voice. "Just quit already. Come work with us. That bastard Dominic-"

"Shut your mouth!" Nathan whirled around. "Mr. Blackwood isn't-"

He forgot to whisper.

Even upstairs, Evelyn would hear every word.

"Our Evelyn has higher standards!" Michael countered. "In all the years I've known her, she's never looked twice at any man, no matter how perfect. Can your boss say the same?"

"But Evelyn nearly killed him!" Nathan hissed.

Michael scoffed. "With what? Her bare hands? She can't even swat a fly! How'd someone like you become an executive assistant?"

Nathan adjusted his glasses, looking dazed. The argument had derailed him.

Seizing the moment, Michael shoved him into the bedroom and slammed the door.

Silence fell.

Evelyn slipped inside, Nathan's words echoing in her mind. True or not, they'd struck a nerve.

She hurried upstairs, swallowing vitamins with a gulp of water. Why did fate keep binding her to Dominic through their children?

Even twins hadn't made motherhood easier. And now this...

Worst of all, these three children meant she'd never truly be free of him.

Evelyn tossed in bed, sleep eluding her. The digital clock mocked her - only thirty minutes had passed.

With a frustrated sigh, she squeezed her eyes shut, willing morning to come.

###Chapter 427

The clock ticked past midnight as Evelyn lay wide awake in bed.

She tossed and turned for what felt like hours before finally grabbing her phone.

1:07 AM glared back at her from the screen.

With a frustrated sigh, she reached for her nightstand drawer. Her fingers closed around the familiar melatonin bottle.

Just as she popped the cap, her gaze landed on the folic acid tablets beside her lamp.

A sharp inhale.

She threw the sleeping pill in the trash without hesitation.

For the baby. She had to remember that now.

By 8 AM, Evelyn had already dropped Lily and Henry at Mooncrest Academy.

She returned with breakfast bags in hand just as Nathan emerged from Michael's room, hastily buttoning his shirt.

"Nathan," she greeted smoothly, "I brought you breakfast."

Michael appeared in the doorway, cheeks flushed. "Evelyn, I can explain-"

"No need," she interrupted. "If you two are serious, maybe you should consider getting your own place. The kids and I might be... distracting." She set down the food. "We could find another property in the neighborhood. Be neighbors."

Michael shook his head vehemently. "Absolutely not! We're fine here. If Nathan stays over, it's only at night-"

Nathan facepalmed.

"Come eat," Michael insisted, dragging him to the table.

Nathan's eyes lingered on Evelyn's outfit - a cream cashmere sweater paired with a crimson wrap dress, finished with knee-high leather boots. Light makeup accentuated her features.

"Going somewhere special, Miss Thorne?" Nathan asked between bites.

Michael answered for her. "Eric Montclair's comeback signing! We're hosting the ceremony at Oceanview Grand today."

Nathan nearly choked. "So it's true? You actually cured him?"

Evelyn deftly changed subjects. "I thought you blocked Michael. What changed?"

Nathan's expression turned dramatic. "I was at a work happy hour when this lunatic stormed in and dragged me out!"

Michael scowled. "Speaking of which, why am I still on your blocked list?"

Evelyn stood abruptly. "Enjoy your breakfast. I should get going."

At precisely 11 AM, Oceanview Grand's grand ballroom buzzed with energy.

Eric Montclair's first public appearance since his hiatus trended worldwide, with thousands watching the livestream.

In the penthouse office of Blackwood Group, Dominic's computer screen displayed the event.

His grip tightened on his pen as the camera zoomed in on Evelyn standing beside Eric.

Both wore matching cream sweaters.

Dominic's jaw clenched.

That was the sweater she'd knitted for him.

The one he'd worn.

The one he'd returned after their breakup.

And now she wore it with another man?

A violent cough racked his chest as fury burned through him.

###Chapter 428

The office door swung open with a sharp creak. Lucas took one look at Dominic's violent coughing fit and immediately rushed to pour him a glass of water.

"You shouldn't be working when you're still recovering! When will you ever listen to your doctors?"

Dominic slammed the glass onto the desk with more force than necessary before striding toward the bathroom. Lucas moved to follow but froze when his gaze caught the live stream still playing on Dominic's laptop.

"Eric, everyone's wondering—why did you choose to collaborate with Thornfield Industries? Was the payout too good to refuse?" The reporter chuckled suggestively.

Eric glanced at Evelyn with a soft smile. Just as he opened his mouth to respond, Evelyn smoothly interjected, "Actually, Eric told me he's been out of the industry for three years. Coming back felt like starting fresh, so he only charged us a modest fee."

The crowd erupted in murmurs. "Miss Thorne, how do you know Eric? You two seem quite close—and matching cream sweaters? That can't be a coincidence," the reporter teased, waggling her eyebrows.

A delicate flush crept up Evelyn's cheeks.

"Pure coincidence," Eric answered smoothly, shrugging off his brown jacket. "The hotel's heating is excessive—I had to take this off."

"Eric, with so many offers upon your return, why Thornfield Industries? What's your connection with Miss Thorne? How long have you known each other?"

Eric's gaze softened. "We met during my illness. This song was born from that time too."

Someone from the audience shouted, "Eric! Give us a live performance of your new song!" The crowd roared in agreement. Evelyn stepped back with an encouraging smile, surrendering the spotlight to him.

Back at Blackwood Group, Dominic emerged from the bathroom to find Lucas had closed the live stream.

Lucas couldn't fathom it. They were over. So why was Dominic still tracking her every move? Who she associated with now was none of his concern.

Why cling to this torment? Hadn't the last betrayal carved him deeply enough?

"Dominic, I'm taking you home," Lucas stated firmly, blocking his path. "Look at yourself. Planning to collapse at your desk?"

Dominic's face darkened. He clenched his fists and stormed toward the elevator, Lucas hot on his heels.

"She came to see me yesterday," Dominic rasped as the elevator doors closed.

Lucas blinked. "Evelyn? She visited you?"

"I didn't meet her." Dominic's Adam's apple bobbed. "That cream sweater today—it was deliberate. A provocation."

Lucas struggled to reconcile this petty image with the Evelyn he knew.

Yet the raw wound in Dominic's chest screamed that perhaps he'd never truly understood her.

"If you didn't love her, her wardrobe choices wouldn't affect you," Lucas said bluntly. "You can't change her. Change yourself."

Easier said than done.

If he could simply stop loving her, this agony wouldn't be shredding him alive.

Meanwhile at the Oceanview Grand, Eric's live performance sent the atmosphere skyrocketing.

Evelyn then took the stage as Thornfield Industries' president, outlining their expansion strategy and demonstrating upcoming products. With Eric lingering beside her, the live stream viewership swelled exponentially.

The marketing impact was nothing short of spectacular.

Over at Marvel Tech, Margaret watched the broadcast, her face contorting with rage.

###Chapter 429

"Evelyn has some tricks up her sleeves!" Margaret hissed through gritted teeth.

Though Eric Montclair wasn't at the peak of his fame anymore, he had once been an icon. His sudden comeback had sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry!

Margaret couldn’t fathom why Eric would go out of his way to help Evelyn. First, he had publicly supported Thornfield Industries, saving them from disaster.

Now, he had composed an entire song for them? It was absurd!

Her fingers flew across her phone as she dialed Zoe Montgomery. The line connected almost instantly.

"Zoe, do you have any idea why Eric is helping Evelyn? Are they secretly involved?"

Zoe was watching the live stream too, her mood just as sour.

Eric wasn’t just talented—he was devastatingly handsome. Any woman would struggle to resist his charm.

"He already gave us the answer during the live stream," Zoe replied coldly. "He said he met Evelyn when he was ill."

Margaret frowned. "What’s so special about that?"

"He was in a vegetative state back then! People in that condition have no consciousness. Even if Evelyn stood by his bedside every day, he wouldn’t have known her. So, he must have met her after he recovered. And how did he recover? Why is he so devoted to her? Isn’t it obvious?"

Margaret’s breath hitched. "You’re saying Evelyn cured him?"

Zoe clenched her jaw. "Exactly. She must have been the one to bring him back. That’s why he’s repaying her with everything he’s got!"

Suddenly, Margaret burst into laughter.

Zoe stiffened. "What’s so funny? Evelyn has Eric as her trump card now. You should be figuring out how to stop her!"

"Since when did Evelyn become some miracle worker? If she’s that skilled, why bother running a company? She should just open a clinic and rake in millions. Look at you—treating Sophia earned you three hundred million. That’s way more profitable than any business!"

Margaret’s words dripped with skepticism.

Zoe scoffed. "If you don’t believe me, fine. I’m not here to convince you."

"It’s not you I don’t believe," Margaret snapped. "It’s Evelyn. There’s no way she’s that capable!"

Zoe inhaled sharply. "I didn’t want to believe it either. But the facts don’t lie. Denying it only makes me look like a fool."

The smirk on Margaret’s face vanished.

"Scared now?" Zoe taunted when Margaret fell silent. "If I’d known you’d crumble this easily, I wouldn’t have invested a dime in you."

Margaret’s temper flared. "Zoe, you lost to Evelyn. Don’t assume everyone else will too. Just watch!"

Zoe didn’t rise to the bait. Instead, she laughed. "Oh, I’ll be watching. Let’s see how you take her down."

At the Oceanview Grand Hotel, the signing ceremony had just concluded. Under the protection of his security team, Eric slipped into a sleek black sedan.

The fans gathered outside the hotel erupted into screams.

Evelyn trailed behind him, watching the chaotic swarm of admirers. The sheer intensity of their devotion reminded her of the stark divide between celebrities and ordinary people.

Once Eric’s car disappeared, the crowd began to disperse.

Not far away, a black Rolls-Royce sat idling. Inside, Dominic Blackwood’s icy gaze locked onto Evelyn.

She stood in a cream sweater, deep in conversation with Michael Sterling. Michael draped an arm over her shoulders, guiding her toward the parking lot.

The sight twisted something inside Dominic.

Evelyn never lacked for men willing to shield her.

Lucas Grant tightened his grip on the steering wheel, stealing a glance at Dominic’s stony expression. "Dominic, let her go. She’s doing just fine without you."

###Chapter 430 Dominic Could See. Evelyn Was Indeed Doing Well.

Evelyn settled into the passenger seat and pulled a water bottle from her bag. She twisted the cap open and took several slow sips of the warm liquid.

Michael waited patiently until she finished before starting the engine.

"What should we have for lunch?" He asked, glancing at her profile.

Evelyn shook her head slightly. "It's too early for lunch. I'm not hungry yet."

Michael persisted, "We could still decide now!"

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn replied, "Actually, I think I'll handle lunch by myself from now on."

Michael's eyes narrowed. He needed meat with every meal, but Evelyn currently had no appetite for it. Before her pregnancy, she'd never turned down food. If he noticed her avoiding meat now, he'd definitely grow suspicious.

"Are you dieting?" Michael's voice turned sharp. "Evelyn, stop this nonsense! You're not some celebrity needing to starve yourself!"

Evelyn massaged her temples. She should've known Michael would notice everything.

"I'm not dieting. I just prefer not having lunch with you anymore."

"What? Then who will you eat with?" His grip tightened on the steering wheel.

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "We should maintain some distance. Remember what Nathan said last night? You care so much about his relationship with Dominic. What if Nathan feels the same about our closeness?"

Michael fell silent.

Evelyn continued, "From now on, we'll eat separately. We can still commute home together after work."

Michael exhaled sharply. "Fine...whatever you say."

Just then, his phone rang. Fishing it from his pocket, he glanced at the caller ID before slowing the car and answering via Bluetooth.

"Are you with Evelyn right now?" Nathan's voice crackled through the speakers.

Michael shot Evelyn a quick look. "N-No...why do you ask?"

He lied instinctively, wanting to hear Nathan's real purpose.

Nathan's tone turned accusing. "Do you know where Evelyn got that cream sweater she wore today? It's outrageous! She originally made it for Mr. Blackwood..."

Michael studied Evelyn's cream-colored sweater and replied calmly, "So? If she gave it to your boss, why does she have it now?"

Nathan huffed. "Probably because he returned it after their breakup!"

"If it's been returned, she can wear it whenever she likes! What business is it of your boss?" Michael's voice grew heated, his words sharpening.

Nathan clearly hadn't expected such a fierce response.

"My point is, Evelyn's deliberately provoking Mr. Blackwood! She must've coordinated this with Eric! Wearing matching white outfits? Are they announcing their relationship? Mr. Blackwood saw the live stream this morning! He was furious!"

"If he watched the stream, he must've heard Eric's explanation. What's there to be angry about? Does he expect Evelyn to stay single forever to please him?"

Michael's logical retort left Nathan momentarily speechless. It made perfect sense. Why was Dominic so upset then? Their relationship had ended bitterly, with attempts on each other's lives. By all accounts, no feelings should remain!

Evelyn sat quietly, easily piecing together Nathan's accusations from Michael's responses.

She'd worn the cream sweater that day at Eric's suggestion the previous night.

The dress was black, so cream would complement it better. Without a cream jacket, Evelyn had chosen the sweater.

She never anticipated Eric would wear a matching color. The unintended coordination had caused this misunderstanding, leaving her deeply embarrassed.

###Chapter 431 However, Evelyn Refused to Humiliate Herself

"Nathan, go tell your boss that Evelyn is already dating Eric Montclair!" Michael wanted Dominic to finally give up and stop obsessing over her.

When Evelyn heard the outrageous lie Michael was spreading, she immediately yanked the Bluetooth earpiece from his ear.

"Nathan, don't listen to him," Evelyn said firmly. "Eric and I are strictly business partners. Besides, your boss was the one who returned the scarf to me, so I'll wear it whenever I please. And if I ever do start dating someone, I might just wear this on our first date too."

Nathan was rendered speechless.

That idiot Michael! How dare he spread such blatant lies about Evelyn's relationship status.

Nothing could describe his current predicament better than sheer awkwardness.

"Miss Thorne, it's your clothing. You have every right to wear it as you wish. I was merely joking with Michael. I've come to realize Mr. Blackwood isn't perfect - he has his flaws too. I'll keep reminding myself of that," Nathan admitted.

"Hmm. Did he go to work today? Shouldn't he be resting at home?" Evelyn asked calmly.

Nathan replied, "He never listens to doctors, but Lucas managed to send him home."

"Hmm."

The conversation hit an uncomfortable lull.

Suddenly Nathan blurted, "I hope you achieve record-breaking sales and become the industry leader."

Evelyn was stunned into silence.

Michael quickly retrieved the earpiece to end the excruciating exchange.

"Evelyn, you've got quick fingers! When are you going to knit me a scarf?" Michael teased, trying to lighten the mood.

Evelyn glared at him.

Michael chuckled and changed subjects. "Dominic is terrifying! How is he still not giving up on you? Looks like you didn't stab him deeply enough!"

Evelyn corrected sharply, "I didn't stab him."

"Oh. Then I suspect he might be mentally unstable."

Evelyn said thoughtfully, "I once read a psychology book that mentioned successful people often think differently than ordinary people."

Michael countered, "But you're perfectly normal!"

Evelyn shrugged, "I wouldn't consider myself successful."

"Not successful? You made Dominic Blackwood, the business tycoon, fall for you. Then you have Eric Montclair, the dazzling celebrity, completely smitten. Honestly, I think Eric might genuinely have feelings for you. During today's event, he couldn't stop looking at you. That gaze... it wasn't professional," Michael exaggerated.

Evelyn threatened, "Are you asking for a beating?"

Michael immediately shut up.

By evening, multiple topics were trending on Twitter.

[Eric Montclair Announces Relationship Status]

Capitalizing on the trend, a marketing account posted a shocking tweet claiming Evelyn and Eric weren't just business partners - they were lovers!

The smoking gun? The scarf Evelyn wore that morning actually belonged to Eric!

The account shared a screenshot from an old fan comment:

[I've been Eric's fan for 8 years! Even during his 3-year hiatus due to injury, I never forgot him! Today's comeback was everything! New fans might not recognize the scarf Evelyn Thorne wore, but we OG fans know! This was Eric's personal signature piece - he wore it to 8 out of 10 events! Now he's given it to Evelyn. If this isn't love, what is?!]

Accompanying the post were countless throwback photos showing Eric consistently wearing the same black scarf at various events.

Was this irrefutable proof?

The internet exploded with reactions, with many fans mourning while others viciously attacked Evelyn online.

At Dominic's mansion, a news notification popped up on his phone:

[Eric Montclair's Relationship Exposed! His Lover: The Stunning CEO of Thornfield Industries, Evelyn Thorne!]

###Chapter 432

Dominic stepped out of the shower, water droplets glistening on his toned physique as they trailed down his damp skin.

He grabbed a plush towel with one hand while clutching his phone in the other.

When the notification flashed across his screen, his fingers hesitated for a fraction of second before tapping it. As he absorbed the content, his piercing gaze darkened into an icy storm.

Since when had Evelyn accepted Eric's romantic gesture? Had she sought him out yesterday to announce her new relationship? Was this ridiculous public display really necessary?

With a violent motion, he hurled his phone across the bathroom. The device shattered against the marble tiles with a resounding crash.

Meanwhile, in her lavish European-style mansion, Margaret swirled a glass of crimson wine with deliberate elegance.

A self-satisfied smirk played on her lips as she scrolled through the trending news on her tablet. "Do you know what entertainers fear most, Zoe?" she purred without looking up. "Losing their adoring fans. And what makes fans abandon their idols? A public romance announcement. Even someone as famous as Eric Montclair can't escape this fate."

Zoe observed her with reluctant admiration.

"This will undoubtedly damage Eric's career. No matter how he spins it, he'll lose followers," Margaret continued, taking a triumphant sip. "The industry has changed. Handsome, talented celebrities are a dime a dozen now."

Zoe crossed her arms. "Don't celebrate too soon. None of today's heartthrobs hold a candle to Eric's star power."

Margaret arched an eyebrow. "My, my. Could it be you're one of his fans too? How unexpected."

"Is that so strange? Remember, our target is Evelyn, not Eric. Don't overstep," Zoe retorted sharply, grabbing her designer handbag before storming out.

During this period, Margaret had been cohabiting with Richard, which meant Zoe frequently joined them for meals.

After Zoe's departure, Richard approached Margaret. "Don't provoke her. Stick to your original plan. You're a businesswoman first - focus on the bottom line."

Margaret waved him off distractedly. "Your daughter infuriates me. Shouldn't you make it up to me? Rub my feet."

Richard immediately knelt to massage her feet. Margaret reclined on the sofa with visible satisfaction, sighing dramatically. "Why did I ever marry Jack? As his wife, I had to obey his every whim, dependent on him for every penny. Pathetic! If only he were alive to see how powerful I've become!"

Richard chuckled sycophantically. "If he were alive, you'd never have broken free. We wouldn't be together now."

"True enough," Margaret conceded. "Though he's dead, his daughter remains. Every debt he owed me, I'll collect from Evelyn - with interest!"

Back at Mooncrest Manor, Evelyn stared at her phone in shock. During her time pretending to be Eric's fan before his treatment, she hadn't recognized the necklace's significance - a piece he famously wore during his idol days.

Had she known its history, she never would have accepted it. When Eric asked her to wear it yesterday, she'd thought nothing of it.

Her fingers flew across the screen to call him.

Eric answered with his characteristic calm warmth. "Evelyn, would you like me to issue a clarification or-"

"Yes," she interrupted firmly. "I'm so sorry, Eric. I didn't realize what the necklace meant to you. I'll return it tomorrow."

"Please let me handle the PR, but keep the gift. It would break my heart otherwise," he pleaded softly.

Evelyn relented. "Alright, I'll keep it. But you must clarify our relationship status publicly."

After a weighted pause, Eric agreed. As the call ended, Evelyn reached for a glass of water, her hand trembling slightly as she took a long sip.

###Chapter 433 by Silent Echo

"How cunning! I told you he was into you!" Michael Sterling sat beside Evelyn, having clearly overheard their exchange. "If you're interested too, you two could be official before midnight!"

"He's too young. Youth makes people reckless," Evelyn explained, brushing her hair behind her ear. "I remember being that age."

Michael smirked. "Oh I know! Back then you were reckless for Dominic. Now karma's coming for you."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, rendered speechless.

"Evie, stop scrolling through social media." Michael ruffled her hair affectionately. "Internet trolls are vicious! Their words cut deep. Don't let them get to you."

"I'm not looking," Evelyn said calmly, locking her phone. "Even if I was, it wouldn't affect me. I've built thicker skin over the years."

"That's my girl!" Michael checked his watch. "Nathan invited me for late-night tacos. I should head out. Call if you need anything."

"Go on then. And no tequila shots!"

"Scout's honor!" Michael crossed his heart before grabbing his jacket and heading out.

At nine-thirty, Evelyn turned off the nightlight in the children's room. As her footsteps faded down the hallway, Lily tugged at Henry's pajama sleeve.

"Henry, Mommy said no to Uncle Eric. I'm sad. Why doesn't she like him? He's so cool and handsome. Wouldn't he make the perfect daddy?" Lily whispered, unable to contain her disappointment.

She'd never dare say this in front of Evelyn, knowing her mother's decisions were final.

Henry remained characteristically composed. Though Eric was undoubtedly attractive and had helped their mother, no man in his opinion deserved her.

"Then good luck."

Lily blinked. "What do you mean? I don't understand."

"Good luck growing up fast. Then you can marry him," Henry deadpanned.

Lily's jaw dropped. "Henry! Are you serious?"

"Guess you don't really like him then."

"I do! But when I grow up, he'll be old!" Lily protested, wrinkling her nose.

Henry adjusted his glasses. "If you truly loved him, age wouldn't matter."

Lily took a dramatic breath. "Fine... wish me luck then."

Back in her room, Evelyn unlocked her phone to find Eric Montclair's latest post from five minutes prior. His verification badge glowed blue beside his name.

[If I'm fortunate enough to find mutual love someday, I'll share that joy with you all. As for Ms. Thorne - she remains my goddess. My admiration and respect for her are eternal. To my fans: please cease all attacks against her. Thank you.]

The tweet instantly went viral.

Meanwhile, Dominic Blackwood scrolled through his phone before bed when a news alert popped up:

[Eric Montclair Declares Evelyn Thorne His Goddess!]

Dominic's jaw clenched. Goddess?

The audacity! Why not just confess his love outright?

Yet Evelyn clearly hadn't taken the bait. Otherwise Eric's tweet would've read: [Yes, Evelyn Thorne and I are together!]

Dominic's brow furrowed as an unfamiliar tension settled in his chest. For the first time since his injury, he opened his messages and typed Evelyn's name.

###Chapter 434

Evelyn didn't see Dominic's message right away. After reading Eric Montclair's tweet, exhaustion overtook her and she collapsed into bed.

Early pregnancy brought waves of nausea and overwhelming fatigue. For the past two days, sleep had come easier than usual.

Normally when insomnia struck, she relied on melatonin tablets. But that night, her head barely touched the pillow before darkness claimed her. She slept straight through until 5 AM.

Only the urgent need to use the bathroom pulled her from slumber.

Reaching for her phone to check the time, Dominic's message flashed on her screen. Her breath caught. Clutching the device, she hurried to the ensuite bathroom.

Dominic's text read: [Were you looking for me yesterday?]

Yesterday? Evelyn wracked her brain. She hadn't attempted to contact him at all!

Wait.

She checked the timestamp - 10:30 PM last night. A shiver raced down her spine, banishing all remnants of sleep.

Returning to bed, she stared at his message, fingers hovering over the keyboard. Should she tell him about the pregnancy? He was still recovering - the news might agitate him.

But lying to Dominic Blackwood was nearly impossible. The man had an uncanny ability to detect falsehoods.

After an internal battle, she typed: [I walked past your office yesterday and thought I'd drop by.]

The moment she hit send, sleep became impossible. Evelyn clutched her phone, wide-eyed at the ceiling.

Her pulse hammered against her ribs. One simple message shouldn't cause this reaction.

Why did other men leave her composed, yet Dominic could unravel her with a single text?

Her phone was on silent. Surely he'd be asleep now and wouldn't reply. She stared blankly at the dark room, phone burning in her palm.

When her eyes grew dry, she checked the time again - and froze.

A reply.

Instantaneous. At 5 AM.

Dominic never slept with his phone. Which meant... he'd been awake all night.

Evelyn sat bolt upright, reading his response: [Drop by? For what? Don't tell me you actually wanted to see me!]

That exclamation point felt like a slap. She could practically see his furious expression as he typed it. Evelyn pressed a hand to her forehead.

How to respond?

Though well-rested, his message left her flustered.

Her fingers moved: [Have you been up all night?]

A weak attempt to change the subject. But the message only fueled Dominic's anger.

After sending his initial text, he'd waited all night for her reply. He'd tried powering off his phone, forcing himself to sleep - all futile efforts.
###Chapter 435

Dominic Blackwood couldn't believe it. As the CEO of Blackwood Group, his heart had been shattered by Evelyn.

He had swallowed his pride and texted her first, yet she hadn't replied immediately!

His mood was absolutely foul! Staring at her message with bloodshot eyes, his fingers flew across the screen. (Are you happy now?)

Evelyn sighed. What a childish text.

But considering he hadn't slept all night, his tantrum was understandable.

Taking a deep breath, she typed patiently. [It's almost 6. Get some rest! I'm going back to sleep too.]

With that sent, Evelyn put her phone down.

Dominic didn't respond. He'd lost this round. In relationships, the one who reached out first was always the loser.

At 7:30 AM, the gates of Dominic's estate slowly opened. Mrs. Whitaker adjusted her purse, preparing to leave.

Sophia noticed and immediately ran after her. Hearing footsteps, Mrs. Whitaker turned. Seeing Sophia, she paused.

"Sophia, I have morning errands. Wait here for your tutor, darling."

Sophia shook her head vigorously. She'd grown accustomed to Mrs. Whitaker's constant presence.

"Where? Take me."

Mrs. Whitaker frowned. "The bus terminal. It's crowded and noisy. You wouldn't like it."

Sophia usually avoided crowds, terrified of strangers. But today was different.

Unable to dissuade her, Mrs. Whitaker relented. If Sophia panicked, the bodyguard could bring her home.

By 8:30 AM, they arrived at the bustling terminal.

Mrs. Whitaker gripped Sophia's hand tightly, monitoring her reactions. Though Sophia frowned, she showed no fear.

Soon, their contact emerged from the crowd.

"Sophia? What are you doing here?" It was Mrs. Pembroke, Eleanor Blackwood's former maid, here to say goodbye.

Sophia studied her curiously.

"You're so brave now, coming to such crowded places," Mrs. Pembroke remarked. "I hope you keep improving."

"She's made remarkable progress," Mrs. Whitaker said. "You're returning home permanently?"

Mrs. Pembroke nodded. "The settlement was generous. My future's secure."

Despite the money, sadness lingered in her eyes.

"Sophia, why didn't you attend your mother's funeral? Did Dominic forbid it?" Mrs. Pembroke's eyes reddened. "She was your mother!"

Sophia blinked, confused. "What mother?"

"Your brother's mother was yours too!"

Sophia's brow furrowed. "Dominic never told me to call her that. We weren't close."

"True. But she was your mother. She'd be thrilled seeing your progress."

"But she's dead. She can't see me." Sophia's blunt words brought tears to Mrs. Pembroke's eyes.

"Sophia, your mother was murdered. I don't expect revenge. Just get better. When you recover, you'll naturally avenge her. And avoid the old estate - her killer lives there." Mrs. Pembroke whispered urgently.

Sophia's head throbbed from the information overload.

"I can't tell Dominic. I'd be silenced. Remember this, Sophia. When I'm gone... or when you're well... avenge your mother..."

A sharp pain stabbed Sophia's chest. She grabbed Mrs. Pembroke's arm.

Leaning closer, the maid whispered her final bombshell: "Henry Thorne is Dominic's biological son. Your mother died because she knew this secret."
###Chapter 436

Thornfield Industries.

After Evelyn had finished all her pending work, her gaze drifted to her phone.

She opened her message history with Dominic, scrolling through their exchanges repeatedly.

Why had he chosen to text her last night?

She had gone to see him two days prior. He must have known about it that very evening.

So why hadn't he reached out then?

Her fingers tapped on the scandalous article about her and Eric. A thought struck her - had Dominic seen the news about them before messaging?

What were his true feelings toward her now?

If he truly despised her, even seeing those headlines wouldn't have prompted contact.

Yet he'd messaged last night without mentioning their painful past. Had he moved on?

Impossible!

The wounds ran too deep for such quick forgiveness.

She frowned, her thoughts tangled in confusion.

Truth be told, if not for his unexpected message, she wouldn't be obsessing over him like this.

The sudden ring of her office phone startled her.

"Evelyn! I'm downstairs at your company! Come down now - lunch is on me!" Sophie's cheerful voice bubbled through the receiver.

Evelyn agreed without hesitation.

Five minutes later, she spotted Sophie in the lobby.

Two stylish young women flanked her cousin, both radiating the same trendy energy as Sophie.

"Evelyn, meet my best friend Elise and my cousin Eleanor. They'll both be my bridesmaids," Sophie announced proudly.

"Hi Evelyn! We've met before at college!" Elise gushed excitedly.

Eleanor added, "We haven't met, but I feel like I know you from all Sophie's stories!"

Smiling, Evelyn led them to a nearby restaurant.

"Out shopping today?"

"Just briefly. They insisted we invite you," Sophie explained, draping an arm around Evelyn's shoulders. "Evelyn, these two are Eric Montclair's biggest fans! They nearly died of jealousy when they saw my photo with him!"

Understanding dawned on Evelyn.

"If there's an opportunity, I'll arrange a meeting."

For Sophie's friends, she'd gladly help.

"You're amazing! Exactly what we'd expect from Eric's muse!" Elise squealed.

Eleanor leaned forward eagerly. "Could you possibly invite Eric to Sophie's wedding? We'd pay for a performance!"

Sophie interjected, "Only if it's not too much trouble. His comeback schedule must be packed - that new single's topping every chart!"

Evelyn nodded. "I'll ask. No harm in checking."

The spicy meat stew arrived.

Two days had passed since Evelyn last ate meat.

Her nausea had subsided, replaced by sudden craving.

"Evelyn, you never eat spicy food," Sophie remarked, noticing the chili flakes in her bowl.

Taking a bite, Evelyn found her appetite awakened. "Occasionally is fine."

"You're getting thinner. Are you eating properly?" Sophie studied Evelyn's gaunt face with concern.

###Chapter 437

Evelyn chuckled awkwardly, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear. "Really? That's just your imagination."

After finishing her meal with satisfaction, she pulled out her phone and typed a message to Eric Montclair. Her fingers hovered over the screen before sending: "Are you available on May 1st?"

The reply came faster than she anticipated.

Once she explained the situation, his agreement was immediate.

"Sophie! Eric just confirmed he'll attend your wedding on May 1st!" Evelyn announced.

The reaction was instantaneous - high-pitched squeals filled the air.

Sophie Mercer, Elise, and Eleanor were practically bouncing with excitement.

In what felt like seconds, Sophie had already shared the news with Adrian.

Adrian then passed the information to Lucas Grant.

"My fiancée says Evelyn was the one who invited him," Adrian grumbled, running a hand through his hair. "Suddenly I'm having second thoughts about this wedding. My future wife is obsessed with Eric Montclair - completely starstruck! And her friends are just as bad. Honestly, every woman there will be fawning over him. As the groom, I'll be completely upstaged. This isn't how I envisioned my wedding at all!"

Though frustrated, Adrian didn't dare voice these concerns to Sophie.

Lucas offered sympathy mixed with amusement. "Don't worry, you won't be the only one miserable. Since Eric clearly has feelings for Evelyn, Dominic will probably be even more upset."

Just yesterday, Evelyn had worn a simple white sweater that coincidentally matched Eric's outfit - and Dominic had nearly lost his mind.

If Evelyn actually started dating Eric? Dominic might never sleep again.

"Does Dominic have some kind of masochistic streak?" Adrian wondered aloud. "If a woman treated me like that, I'd walk away immediately. No way would I keep chasing her."

Lucas considered this thoughtfully. "It's not exactly masochism. Remember, Evelyn suffered too. He's just... persistent. Whether it's business or relationships, once Dominic sets his mind on something, nothing can change it."

Most people would retreat when faced with obstacles. Dominic? He'd bulldoze straight through them.

"So... should we tell him about this?" Adrian asked.

After a brief pause, Lucas nodded. "I'll find the right moment."

At precisely 3 PM, Evelyn returned to Thornfield Industries.

Before she could reach her office, Michael Sterling called out to her.

"Evelyn! Over here!"

She changed course immediately. "What is it?"

Michael guided her toward the conference room with a hand on her elbow.

Inside sat two well-dressed individuals.

"Staff from Vogue Forward magazine," Michael whispered. "They want to interview you. I've checked them out - reputable publication. Your call whether to proceed."

Evelyn considered briefly before agreeing.

"Hello," she greeted the journalists warmly.

The female reporter smiled professionally. "Miss Thorne, we'd like to conduct a preliminary interview today. If you're available later, we could schedule a photoshoot at our studio. This initial conversation should take about thirty minutes."

Checking her watch, Evelyn nodded. "That works."

"Miss Thorne," the male reporter began, "can we expect more collaborations with Eric Montclair moving forward? Perhaps as a brand ambassador? Have you considered that possibility?"

Evelyn wasn't surprised by the immediate Eric reference.

If not for last night's viral scandal and subsequent media frenzy, a prestigious magazine like Vogue Forward wouldn't have sought her out.

"No concrete plans at the moment," she answered smoothly.

"Eric called you his 'goddess.' Would you say he's your ideal man?" the female reporter asked with a knowing smile.

Evelyn hesitated briefly. "He's certainly admirable. I have tremendous respect for him."

The questions grew more pointed. "Our research indicates you had a previous relationship with Dominic Blackwood of Blackwood Group. Care to comment on that?"

###Chapter 438

Of course, Evelyn wouldn’t answer that question.

She couldn’t show too much resistance, either, so she carefully deflected, “I’d rather not discuss anything related to him. For your magazine’s sake, I suggest avoiding topics that might… complicate distribution.”

Her response made the nosy magazine staff realize their blunder.

“Understood, Miss Thorne. You studied medicine, yet you chose entrepreneurship after graduation. What inspired that decision?”

Evelyn’s brows twitched slightly.

If she answered honestly, it would take days to explain.

She needed to keep this brief.

Just as she opened her mouth to respond, a wave of nausea hit her without warning. Clamping a hand over her mouth, she bolted for the nearest restroom.

“Miss Thorne! Are you alright?” The staff scrambled after her.

Everything happened too fast.

Evelyn barely made it to the stall before emptying her stomach violently.

Lunch came back up in painful heaves.

Tears pricked her eyes from the force of it.

Once her stomach was empty, the discomfort faded as quickly as it had come.

She flushed the toilet and leaned against the wall, steadying herself.

Michael stormed into the restroom moments later, his expression tight with concern.

“Evelyn, what’s wrong?” He gripped her shoulders, turning her to face him. “You’re pale. Did you just throw up?”

She pushed his hands away and moved to the sink, splashing cold water on her face. “Sophie and I overdid it at lunch. I ate too much.”

“You could’ve taken leftovers! Why force yourself until you’re sick?” His frown deepened. “I’m taking you home.”

“The interview isn’t finished,” she protested. “I’ll leave after we wrap up.”

“You just vomited. Everything else can wait.”

“I’m fine now.” The cool water had helped. Squaring her shoulders, she walked past him. “Michael, focus on your work. I’ll handle this.”

To the staff, she offered an apologetic smile. “Sorry about that. Let’s continue.”

Sensing her fatigue, they kept the remaining questions light before concluding the session.

After seeing them out, Evelyn grabbed her bag and headed home.

The nausea had passed, but her body felt drained, weak.

All she wanted was to collapse on her couch.

Since learning about her pregnancy, she’d stopped driving.

Morning sickness had been brutal with Lily and Henry, and this time might be worse.

Driving in that state was too risky.

She flagged down a taxi outside Thornfield Industries.

At home, she curled up on the sofa and pulled out her phone, typing a message to Sophie.

After much deliberation, she’d decided to tell her.

The response was immediate—Sophie called from a private corner, voice shrill with excitement.

“Evelyn Thorne! You’re pregnant?! Whose baby is it? Holy hell, I’m gonna have a heart attack!” Sophie’s shriek nearly burst her eardrum. She sounded more thrilled than the time she’d met Eric Montclair.

###Chapter 439

Evelyn winced as she pulled her phone away from her ear. Sophie's shrieking voice was making her eardrums throb.

"Evelyn Thorne! Don't you dare die on me! Spill it right now! Whose baby are you carrying? I'm losing my damn mind over here!"

Sophie's voice crackled through the speaker. "Where the hell are you? I'm coming over right now! You better explain everything to my face!"

Evelyn couldn't help but chuckle at her best friend's dramatic reaction.

"I'm at home. Don't bother coming over," Evelyn said, stifling a yawn. "I'm going straight to bed after this call. Whose baby do you think it is...?"

She rubbed her temples. "I'm only telling you because my morning sickness is getting worse. I can barely keep food down, let alone alcohol... If anyone tries to pressure me into drinking at your wedding, you'll have to cover for me."

They'd previously planned to go all out at Sophie's bachelorette party the night before the wedding.

With their wild group of friends, alcohol would definitely be involved. Telling Sophie now would prevent complications later.

"Pregnant women can't drink! I'll personally guard your glass all night," Sophie declared, then gasped. "Wait... This isn't Dominic's baby, is it? Holy shit, what are you two playing at?"

Hearing his name sent a jolt through Evelyn's system.

Things between her and Dominic were... complicated. She'd been deliberately avoiding any thoughts about him.

It was the only way to keep the pain at bay.

"Keep this between us," Evelyn said, climbing the stairs to her bedroom. "The pregnancy might not even last three months."

"Of course I'll keep your secret," Sophie promised, then her voice turned venomous. "That bastard Dominic! What does he think he's doing? Is he even a man?"

Evelyn's head pounded. "Stop cursing him. This won't happen again."

She'd decided to view this pregnancy as her final act of atonement toward Dominic.

Whether the baby survived or not, after this, they'd be even. No more debts between them.

"You're too soft!" Sophie fumed. "If he dares touch you again, I'll personally hand you a pair of scissors!"

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks as she caught Sophie's meaning.

"Sophie, don't be angry. If the baby's healthy, I'll keep it. Raising another child alone won't be difficult."

"Humph! Go rest! I won't disturb you anymore."

That evening at Blackwood Manor...

Lucas's sleek sports car rolled into the circular driveway.

Dominic stood at the entrance in slate gray lounge pants and a black t-shirt, arms crossed as he watched his CFO approach.

"Here to mooch dinner," Lucas announced, setting down several designer shopping bags in the foyer. He updated Dominic on company affairs before adding, "You should keep resting at home. One day off and you already look better."

Dominic ignored the comment.

"Where's Sophia? I'll call her down for dinner." Lucas glanced around the grand hallway.

"Not feeling well today." Dominic strode toward the dining room. "You're putting in too much effort just to freeload a meal."

"Mainly came to check on you." Lucas followed, unperturbed. "How were you yesterday? I had nightmares all night. What's wrong with Sophia? Is it her head injury acting up? When's her next treatment?"

"You're unusually chatty today." Dominic's sharp gaze cut through him. "What's really going on?"

"Nothing." Lucas suddenly found the marble floors fascinating.

Dominic noted his evasion but didn't press further.

They engaged in a silent standoff until Lucas cracked first.

"So you're really skipping Adrian's wedding?" Lucas took his seat at the lavish dining table. "Eric's going. Evelyn personally invited him."

The carefully constructed calm on Dominic's face fractured.

"They've booked a beachfront villa for the pre-wedding party," Lucas continued mercilessly. "All-night rager. Not sure if Eric's attending, but Evelyn definitely is."

Dominic's expression turned glacial, all emotion locked behind impenetrable walls. Three icy words escaped his lips: "I'm not going."

###Chapter 440 Lucas was stunned by Dominic's response.

"Have you really thought this through?" Lucas teased, his fingers drumming against the wine glass. "Took you long enough to come to your senses. Do you know what Evelyn told Nathan? She said since you returned that sweater, she'll wear it whenever she pleases."

He paused for dramatic effect.

"And she might even wear it on future dates."

Dominic's grip on his silverware tightened until his knuckles turned bone-white.

"Do I look like I care?"

Lucas shrugged. "Just trying to help you move on."

"Then why bring her up at all?" Dominic's icy glare could freeze hell over. "Never mention her again. I'm done with that chapter."

"Fantastic! I was worried you'd still be hung up on her." Lucas exhaled dramatically. "Pity you can't drink. More for me then."

He sauntered to the mahogany bar, selecting an expensive Bordeaux. By the time he turned around, Dominic had finished eating and disappeared from the dining hall.

"Hey!" Lucas called after him, wine glass in hand. "Come keep me company! Dining alone is depressing!"

Dominic found himself outside Sophia's door. After pulling an all-nighter, he'd slept until noon today.

Mrs. Wilkins had informed him Sophia skipped both breakfast and lunch, her mood unusually somber.

Earlier, when he'd checked on her, she'd been asleep. Now, as dusk painted the sky, it was time she woke. Any more sleep would disrupt her nighttime rest.

The door creaked open.

Sophia lay staring blankly at the ceiling, her dark eyes unfocused. Dominic couldn't decipher her thoughts.

"Sophia." He perched on the edge of her bed, voice softening. "Dinner's ready."

Her small hand suddenly gripped his. "Brother... your mother was my mother too, right?"

Dominic's breath hitched. "Mrs. Whitaker took you to the bus station this morning. Did that scare you?"

"Brother," she persisted, ignoring his question, "your mother is my mother, right?"

"Yes." The word came out strained. This wasn't like Sophia. She rarely asked questions, let alone probing ones about their shared past.

Yet now she demanded answers with unusual intensity.

"Why didn't you take me to her funeral?" Mrs. Pembroke's words echoed in Sophia's mind, taking root.

"The funeral was crowded." Dominic searched her face. "You used to hate crowds. I was protecting you."

He studied her reaction carefully. "You're not afraid anymore, are you?"

Sophia shook her head with surprising determination.

Dominic arched an eyebrow at this unexpected development.

"Then next time, we'll go out together."

"But you're still recovering." Sophia suddenly sat up. "Brother, I'm hungry."

Dominic helped her from bed, guiding her to the dining hall where Lucas immediately hid his wine bottle.

"Sophia! Mrs. Wilkins said you weren't feeling well." Lucas' concern seemed genuine. "Did you see a doctor?"

She shook her head silently, focusing on her meal. As she ate, Dominic slipped away to make a phone call, his expression unreadable.

###Chapter 441

The moment the call connected, Dominic relayed Sophia's condition in clipped tones. "Is it true she can recover without additional surgery?"

On the other end, the family physician hesitated. "It's promising, but I can't guarantee full recovery. What I can say is that another operation would cause irreversible damage."

Dominic already knew that. After Zoe Montgomery's two failed craniotomies, he'd taken Sophia to every specialist in Ravenshore. Each procedure had left her weaker. Now, he stood at a crossroads.

"Mr. Blackwood," the doctor ventured, "have you consulted Dr. Ashford?"

"No."

A pause. "Well... if you're not continuing with Dr. Ashford, perhaps consider Evelyn Thorne. I reviewed Eric Montclair's case—his vocal recovery is nothing short of miraculous. He's performing nearly at pre-accident levels."

The doctor didn't know about Dominic's history with Evelyn.

Dominic's grip tightened on the phone. He'd asked Evelyn once. Her refusal had been absolute—I wouldn't treat Sophia if she were the last patient on earth. That merciless woman would never help.

Meanwhile, in a gilded European mansion, Zoe lingered after dinner—unusual for her. Margaret Thorne's plan had faltered.

Margaret had banked on Eric's scandal destroying his career. Instead, his heartfelt social media post had only solidified his fanbase. New followers flocked to him; his latest single broke streaming records.

Zoe set down her teacup with a clink. "Aunt Margaret, Thornfield Industries' quarterly profits just doubled. Their drones sell for ten times our products' price. At this rate—"

"Patience, Zoe," Margaret drawled. "Eric's fans can't prop up Evelyn forever. Trends fade."

Zoe's eyes darkened. "I want her suffering."

Margaret smiled. "Oh, I have a new move prepared."

Zoe's father frowned. "Zoe, Margaret is managing multiple ventures. Show respect."

Zoe whirled on him. "I'm her largest investor. If you can't secure another 300 million, stay out of it!" She stormed out, heels clicking like gunshots.

April's end arrived swiftly.

On the eve of Sophie Mercer and Adrian Vaughn's wedding festivities, they arrived at Mooncrest Manor at dawn to collect Evelyn.

Adrian blinked at her. "Evelyn, you're... different. Are you unwell?"

Sophie elbowed him. "Shut it! She looks stunning—just slimmer!"

Truthfully, pregnancy had stolen three kilograms from Evelyn. Surviving on broth and fruit left her ethereal but fragile, like glass under too much light.

###Chapter 442

Sophie helped Evelyn into the car while Adrian followed closely behind. "Try talking some sense into her, Sophie!" he urged. "She's refusing to eat because of this ridiculous diet! It's not healthy at all, but she won't listen to reason. Look how thin she's become! She used to take evening walks around the neighborhood, now she barely moves from the couch..."

Sophie gave Adrian's shoulder a reassuring pat. "I'll handle it. Don't worry. This diet phase won't last forever."

"But why wasn't I invited today?" Adrian pouted.

"Because someone needs to watch the twins!" Sophie reminded him with a wink.

Once inside the car, Sophie waved goodbye through the window as the vehicle pulled away from the curb.

Evelyn leaned forward from the backseat. "Did you invite Nathan?"

Sophie scoffed. "Why would I? He's Dominic's assistant... I didn't invite anyone connected to the Blackwoods, including Adrian's old friend Lucas."

Evelyn couldn't suppress a small laugh.

"It's not just for your sake," Sophie continued, adjusting her seatbelt. "I genuinely can't stand them. You know what they say - birds of a feather flock together. If Dominic's a scoundrel, then everyone around him must be just as bad. If I'd met Adrian any later, he might've fallen under their toxic influence too."

Evelyn caught Adrian's eye in the rearview mirror as he pressed his lips together, wisely choosing not to argue.

"Evelyn, where did you get that gorgeous dress?" Sophie's attention shifted to her friend's outfit. "And that white blazer is absolutely stunning!"

Since her morning sickness had become unbearable, Evelyn had stopped going to the office. Bored at home, she'd turned to online shopping - the floral dress and tailored blazer were recent acquisitions.

"I'll send you the links!" Evelyn offered.

"Please do! It's been ages since I indulged in some retail therapy."

Adrian couldn't resist chiming in from the front seat. "Evelyn, if you're serious about losing weight, you should go shopping with Sophie more often! Walking around stores burns calories too - and it's much healthier than starving yourself."

Before Evelyn could respond, Sophie cut in sharply. "How Evelyn chooses to manage her weight is her business. Stay out of it."

"I'm just concerned about her health as your best friend," Adrian protested.

"Evelyn doesn't need your concern," Sophie retorted. "She has mine."

Adrian exhaled quietly, recognizing a losing battle. Sophie rarely got defensive with him - except when it came to Evelyn.

'She won't talk sense into Evelyn about this dangerous diet, and she won't let anyone else either,' he thought in frustration. 'What's her deal?'

An hour later, they arrived at the coastal estate. The weather was perfect - bright sunshine with temperatures reaching a comfortable 25°C.

Sophie and Evelyn stepped out hand in hand while Adrian discreetly snapped a photo of them walking toward the mansion. He immediately texted it to Lucas with a caption:

'Guess which one is Evelyn?'

Lucas hadn't paid much attention to Evelyn-related news since that awkward dinner at Dominic's place. The CEO had made it clear he wanted no updates about her.

Squinting at the photo, Lucas zoomed in. Sophie was easy to spot with her distinctive ash-blonde hair. The woman beside her wore a floral sundress with a white blazer draped over her shoulders.

The slender figure barely resembled the Evelyn he remembered. She looked almost ethereal, as if a strong gust might carry her away.

Lucas typed back: 'Don't tell me that's Evelyn in the floral dress.'

'That's her! She dieted herself down to nothing! I don't get why she's torturing herself like this. Unless it's for Eric? Otherwise it makes no sense.'

'You're exaggerating.'

'Not at all! Though I'll admit she looks striking - fragile and delicate now. If she'd looked like this when she was with Dominic, maybe they wouldn't have fought so much.'

###Chapter 443

Intrigued by Evelyn, Lucas paused for a brief moment before typing a message to Adrian.

‘Take a front-facing photo and send it to me immediately.’

‘You’re not planning to forward this to Dominic, are you?’ Adrian replied skeptically.

‘Just do it!’ Lucas insisted.

Inside the lavish mansion, the heaters hummed softly, wrapping the space in a comfortable warmth.

Both Sophie and Evelyn had shed their jackets, settling onto the plush couch with ease.

Sophie had arranged an assortment of fresh fruits on the table, presenting them before Evelyn with a proud smile.

Evelyn’s eyes widened as she picked up a ripe peach. "I didn’t think peaches were in season yet," she remarked, surprised.

Sophie grinned. "Money can make any season the right season. Go on, try it!"

With a soft laugh, Evelyn took a bite.

Seizing the moment, Adrian discreetly snapped a photo.

The result was stunning—perfect composition, lighting, and an effortless elegance. Evelyn looked both alluring and sweet, her lips curved around the fruit.

Adrian sent the photo to Lucas, who let out an involuntary exhale upon seeing it.

‘Are those arms even real?’ Lucas typed back, stunned.

Evelyn’s sleeveless dress revealed slender, porcelain-smooth arms.

‘She looks like she’s lost weight after some serious illness,’ Adrian replied bluntly.

Lucas scowled at his phone. ‘Don’t say that! Even if she and Dominic are over, you shouldn’t wish her ill!’

Adrian backtracked. ‘I didn’t mean it like that. You haven’t seen her in person—it’s even more shocking up close.’

A sudden urge to see her for himself gripped Lucas. But going alone felt awkward, so he needed company.

Leaning back in his leather chair, he swiped through his contacts until he found Dominic’s number.

He couldn’t just send the photo outright—Dominic would be furious. So, he crafted a careful message instead.

‘Dominic, the Q1 financial report is being sent to you now. Review it when you have time.’

A minute later, Dominic replied. ‘Understood.’

Lucas attached the report—and, with a smirk, Evelyn’s photo as an "accidental" addition. He waited, staring at his screen, heart pounding with anticipation.

No response came, no matter how many times he refreshed.

"Did he not even recognize her?" Lucas muttered, half-amused. "That would be hilarious."

Ten minutes passed in silence. Unable to stand the suspense, Lucas pushed out of his chair and strode toward Dominic’s office.

Meanwhile, in the CEO’s office…

Dominic’s gaze was fixed on the photo of Evelyn, his expression darkening. At first glance, he hadn’t recognized her—only a vague sense of familiarity.

Then he noticed Sophie beside her, and realization struck like lightning.

The woman holding the peach was Evelyn.

His chest tightened.

‘Why has she lost so much weight? Is she sick?’ His thoughts raced. ‘No one loses that much weight that quickly unless something’s wrong.’

A cold dread settled in his stomach.

###Chapter 444

Lucas didn't bother knocking as he barged into Dominic's office, swinging the door open with careless abandon.

Dominic immediately set his phone face down at the intrusion.

"Uh... Dominic, I may have accidentally sent you a photo of Evelyn..." Lucas said with exaggerated innocence, clearing his throat.

Dominic's piercing gaze lifted. "I won't punish you even if you admit you did it deliberately."

Lucas chuckled nervously. "Adrian mentioned Evelyn's lost significant weight, almost like she's ill. Didn't believe him until he showed me the picture."

"Judging by your amusement, I assume she's not actually sick." Dominic's voice was flat.

Lucas's grin faltered. "Well... Apparently she's dieting. With her medical background, you'd think she'd know starvation isn't healthy. She's acting as irrational as when she tried to kill you."

Dominic's expression darkened as he set aside his documents. "Perhaps you'd prefer working at Thornfield Industries, given your sudden concern for her wellbeing?"

"Never mind! I came for something else entirely!" Lucas backtracked quickly. "Leaving early today. There's a dinner party I'm attending."

"Since when do you report your social calendar to me?"

"Fine, no more games. Want to come? Adrian says there'll be plenty of beautiful women..."

"Get out."

Lucas fled before Dominic could throw something.

Once alone, Dominic unlocked his phone. Evelyn's smiling face filled the screen.

Zooming in, he studied her features - that same bright, carefree expression from when they'd first met. Young. Radiant. Untouched by the bitterness between them.

It had been years since he'd seen her so relaxed. With him, she was always guarded, tense.

At the beachfront villa, guests began arriving in waves. The crowd skewed young, each more stylish than the last.

Evelyn sat curled on a sofa, feeling like she'd wandered into a high-fashion runway show.

With no scheduled morning activities, the group mingled over brunch, laughter ringing through the open space.

When lunch preparations began, everyone migrated to the kitchen to debate menus and cooking assignments.

Evelyn, appetite absent, excused herself to rest in her room after telling Sophie.

Adrian noticed her departure and nudged Sophie. "She's not seriously skipping meals again, is she?"

"That's exactly what she's doing!" Sophie shoved him away. "I told you to stay out of it, remember?"

Adrian caught her wrist, frowning. "You're acting strange. Every time I mention Evelyn, you react like I'm committing treason."

"Because you're Team Dominic!" Sophie snapped, inventing excuses. "Evelyn wants nothing to do with him. Her diet is none of your concern!"

Adrian sighed. "I'm just worried she'll collapse. She looks like a strong breeze could knock her over."

"She's an adult who makes her own choices. If she faints, we'll take her to the hospital. End of discussion."

After lunch, Sophie herded everyone to the beach, leaving the villa blissfully quiet.

Evelyn slept through the afternoon, only stirring when Sophie returned at dusk bearing dinner.

The rich aroma of spices roused her.

"Made you spicy chicken soup," Sophie announced, placing the steaming bowl on the bedside table. "Mom swore by this when she was pregnant with me - only thing she could keep down." Her voice softened. "Hurts seeing you like this. How much longer until you're better?"

Evelyn pushed herself upright, the scent triggering unexpected hunger pangs.

###Chapter 445

Evelyn felt significantly better after sleeping through most of the day, the nausea finally subsiding to a dull ache.

"It's unpredictable," Sophie said, handing her a steaming bowl of soup. "Some women barely experience pregnancy symptoms at all. Maybe you'll be one of the lucky ones."

Evelyn settled onto the couch, inhaling the rich aroma of the spicy chicken soup. "Thank you for this, Sophie. It's been ages since I had something this comforting."

"Don't overdo it," Sophie warned, sitting across from her. "You don't want to trigger another wave of nausea." She smirked. "Guess what Adrian did today? He was so worried you'd collapse from skipping lunch that he booked an ambulance. It's still parked outside the mansion right now."

Touched, Evelyn smiled. "Sophie, I hope you and Adrian have the happiest life together."

"I know," Sophie said, her eyes softening. "But right now, your priority is taking care of yourself and that little one inside you. Just imagining your baby being as brilliant and beautiful as Henry and Lily makes me pray for a safe and healthy arrival."

Evelyn nodded, warmth spreading through her chest.

After dinner, she followed Sophie out of the guest room.

The moment the others saw her descending the stairs, they immediately ushered her to the center of the couch.

"Evelyn! Come play with us! Don't worry—Sophie already told us you're not feeling great, so we won't force you to do anything even if you lose!"

Evelyn shot Sophie a grateful look.

"What are we playing? I'm not exactly a pro at games," Evelyn admitted, though she felt surprisingly energized.

"It's a challenge where you can't get flustered! We'll show you videos, and if your heart rate spikes, you lose!"

Evelyn almost laughed. This was too easy. She had never been truly attracted to anyone except Dominic. There was no way she'd lose.

Sophie leaned in, lowering her voice. "They're shameless, Evelyn. The videos might be... intense."

A flush crept up Evelyn's neck, but she remained confident.

Just then, Sophie's cousin Eleanor fastened a heart rate monitor around Evelyn's wrist. "If you win, you get to make one unreasonable demand from anyone here. But honestly? I don’t think you stand a chance."

Evelyn smirked. "Oh, I'm definitely winning this."

The lights dimmed, and the large screen flickered to life.

A strikingly handsome man appeared, lifting his shirt to reveal sculpted abs. The room erupted in laughter.

Evelyn chuckled, but her pulse barely wavered.

They cycled through several more clips—each more ridiculous than the last—but Evelyn remained composed. She'd seen plenty of attractive men during her time in Stonebridge. None of them had ever stirred her.

Then, Eric Montclair's face filled the screen.

Clips of him in a crisp white shirt, knight's armor, and a tailored suit played in succession. The room exploded into chaos, everyone cheering and whistling.

Evelyn's heart rate spiked instantly.

A sharp snap cut through the noise.

The lights blazed on, flooding the room with brightness.

Everyone froze, turning toward the doorway.

Dominic stood there, clad in all black, his presence commanding and enigmatic against the night behind him. His expression was ice-cold, his piercing gaze sweeping over the room like a storm.

The air crackled with tension.

###Chapter 446

Evelyn glanced at the heart rate monitor strapped to her wrist, watching the numbers plummet from one hundred to eighty.

'Why is he here? Sophie specifically said she didn't invite Dominic or his associates. Did he just crash the party?' Her thoughts raced.

Sophie stood frozen beside her. She pinched Adrian's arm sharply. "What's going on? Why is Dominic Blackwood in my apartment?"

The atmosphere turned icy the moment Dominic stepped through the door.

Sophie clearly hadn't anticipated his arrival, yet lacked the courage to actually throw him out.

Adrian leaned in, whispering urgently. "Now that he's here, we should welcome him properly! Stop looking like you've seen a ghost and play along!"

With forced cheerfulness, Adrian approached Dominic. "Dominic! Lucas! What a surprise! Have you eaten? The kitchen's still stocked if you're hungry..."

"We're fine," Lucas cut in smoothly. "What were you all doing? We could hear the commotion from the hallway!"

His casual remark broke the tension slightly, easing the discomfort in the room.

"We were playing this attraction game where you lose if your heart rate spikes! Want to join?" Elise, Sophie's best friend, offered enthusiastically.

"Absolutely! How's it played?" Lucas grabbed Dominic's arm, dragging him toward the group.

Sophie shot Elise a murderous glare for inviting trouble.

Misunderstanding the look, Elise whispered, "Relax! If they lose, we get to prank them!"

Sophie's expression cleared instantly.

"Evelyn, let's move aside." Sophie helped Evelyn up from the couch's center, making space for Lucas and Dominic.

The heart rate monitor was removed from Evelyn's wrist as Elise approached the newcomers. "Who wants to go first?"

Without hesitation, Lucas pointed at Dominic. "Him."

Dominic's glare could have melted steel.

Lucas cleared his throat, grabbing a handful of snacks from the table. "What? I'm suddenly starving. Nerves, you know."

Elise extended the monitor to Dominic. "Put this on."

Dominic had always despised games of any kind. "I don't play," he stated coldly.

"Then why are you here?" Elise challenged, genuinely confused.

Adrian tensed beside them. Apparently Sophie's friends shared her reckless bravery.

'How are they not terrified of Dominic?' He wondered.

Just as Adrian moved to intervene, Dominic snatched the monitor from Elise's hand.

Lucas grinned, pulling out his phone. "Looked it up - simple rules. They show you videos, you win by not reacting. Perfect for you - nothing ever gets under your skin."

Overconfident, Lucas announced, "Let's make this interesting! I bet he'll win! Who thinks he'll lose? Name your stakes!"

Aside from Lucas, Adrian, Sophie and Evelyn, no one present knew Dominic beyond his intimidating reputation.

Ever the entertainer, Elise stepped forward. "I'll take that bet! If I lose, three shots. But if you lose..." She produced a full bottle of whiskey. "...you drink this entire thing."

"Deal!" Lucas laughed.

The women huddled together, scrolling through videos. For a man like Dominic, ordinary attractive women wouldn't suffice - they needed something truly provocative. "I've got classic romantic scenes," Elise murmured. "And some... considerably steamier options."

###Chapter 447

The room erupted in laughter.

"Let's add all of them in here! And just in case he doesn’t like women—"

"—We should throw in some gorgeous men too!"

"Perfect! I’ve got just the collection for that!"

"What is it? Show me!"

"Hahaha! This is gold! Not bad at all!"

The girls were having a blast scrolling through videos, but they were too young to truly understand what kind of man Dominic Blackwood was.

Lucas Grant remained unfazed, even amused by their antics. Dominic wouldn’t lose even if they bombarded him with explicit content.

Adrian Vaughn approached Evelyn Thorne and Sophie Mercer, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. "I couldn’t say no when Lucas asked for the location. He’s my senior… He didn’t mention Dominic would be here, but even if he had, I would’ve let them come!"

Sophie shot him a glare. "Explaining now doesn’t change what you did."

Adrian flashed a nervous grin. "I was worried you’d be mad, especially you, Evelyn…"

"They’re your friends. It’s normal to invite them. I don’t mind," Evelyn said calmly.

Gratitude flickered in Adrian’s eyes. "You’re so understanding, Evelyn! But just to be clear, I didn’t invite them. They invited themselves."

Of course, he couldn’t admit he’d secretly taken a photo of Evelyn—that would reveal he was the reason Lucas and Dominic had shown up in the first place.

Sophie’s gaze slid toward Dominic, cold and assessing.

It was obvious why Dominic had come. If Evelyn hadn’t been here, he wouldn’t have bothered.

"You two should sit on the couch! Aren’t your legs tired from standing?" Adrian suggested.

"Evelyn doesn’t want to sit there," Sophie said flatly. She had tried to guide Evelyn toward the couch earlier, but Evelyn had refused, moving to a spot where Dominic couldn’t see her.

"Fine, I’ll grab chairs for you." Adrian quickly fetched two chairs.

Once seated, Sophie leaned in and whispered, "I saw your heart rate spike to a hundred during the challenge. Hah! You’re totally into him!"

Evelyn had regained her composure completely. "It’s still within normal range as long as it’s under a hundred."

Sophie smirked. "If Dominic hadn’t barged in, your heart rate would’ve skyrocketed past that!"

"Doesn’t matter. It didn’t."

"Come on, Evelyn, are you falling for Eric? He’s so obedient around you—he’d spoil you rotten if you let him!"

Evelyn cringed.

"I admire him. And yes, I like his face. But that’s not romantic. You’re his fan too—does that mean you don’t love Adrian? Stop joking like that. I don’t want scandal headlines."

Sophie sighed and nodded.

Soon, Elise and the others had gathered their videos, and Dominic’s challenge was about to begin.

"Evelyn, do you think he’ll lose?" Sophie asked.

"No idea."

Just then, the screen lit up with a couple tangled in a heated kiss on a bed. Evelyn’s cheeks burned.

She couldn’t even imagine Dominic’s reaction.

###Chapter 448 by Silent Echoes

Evelyn fumbled with her phone, desperate for any distraction from the awkward tension in the room.

Lucas glanced at the monitor screen before checking Dominic's vitals again.

'Impressive! His pulse hasn't fluctuated one bit!' He nearly questioned if the equipment malfunctioned, or if Dominic truly had mastered complete self-control.

Adrian was equally focused on the heart rate monitor strapped to Dominic's wrist. "The device works perfectly," he remarked. "It registered changes when Evelyn wore it earlier."

"How did Evelyn perform in her challenge?" Lucas inquired.

Adrian shot a look at Evelyn, who remained stone-faced while Sophie glared daggers at him. He quickly averted his gaze. "She won. The alarm would've sounded if her heart rate spiked, but it stayed steady the whole time."

Lucas hummed thoughtfully, his eyes lingering on Evelyn.

Evelyn kept her head down, fingers flying across her phone screen in obvious avoidance.

As the first video concluded, the screen transitioned to a sultry model striking provocative poses. Every calculated movement oozed seduction.

Someone whistled appreciatively while others stole glances at Dominic, waiting for his reaction.

Dominic's expression remained grim, looking more like he was attending a solemn memorial than watching an attractive woman.

His pulse showed the slightest fluctuation - barely noticeable - likely just from increased breathing.

"He's clearly not into women! Try handsome men!" Elise, who'd been studying Dominic's reactions closely, shouted to the technician.

The screen switched to a muscular blond Adonis with golden locks cascading over broad shoulders.

Dominic's stern look darkened instantly, the image clearly reminding him of Michael Sterling.

Elise slumped in defeat at Dominic's obvious distaste. "Not into men either, apparently."

"Play that viral 'Macho Men Must Watch' clip then!"

The screen filled with a chubby-cheeked baby's face.

The room erupted in laughter, mostly from the male guests.

'See? All men love babies,' Elise thought triumphantly, watching Dominic.

His brow relaxed slightly, but his pulse stayed rock-steady at eighty beats per minute.

Lucas leaned back with a smug chuckle. "This game's too easy for him!"

Elise refused to concede defeat. "I've never met a man uninterested in everything."

"That's why he's successful - only cares about money."

"Fine! But the game isn't over! I'm not giving up yet!"

Another round of intimate scenes began playing when suddenly, Evelyn found herself shoved toward Dominic.

"..." Evelyn's mind reeled. 'Has Sophie lost her mind?! Pushing me toward Dominic like this?'

###Chapter 449 Dominic stared in shock at the woman beside him.

When he first entered the mansion, he'd only caught a brief glimpse of Evelyn from across the room. She had been smiling brightly - until her eyes met his. That radiant smile vanished instantly. By the time he took his seat, she'd already slipped away unnoticed.

Now seated next to him, Dominic could see how sharply defined her cheekbones had become. The panic flashing in her hazel eyes was unmistakable.

'She's lost so much weight,' he realized with a pang.

The fierce, independent woman he knew had transformed into someone fragile. She looked breakable now - as if he could shatter her with just one careless touch.

Their gazes locked for one electric moment before Evelyn tried to bolt.

Dominic's hand shot out, fingers wrapping around her delicate wrist like a manacle.

The entire room watched the unfolding drama with bated breath. Everyone present knew about Dominic and Evelyn's tumultuous past. The tension between them was palpable, sparking excited whispers.

As if responding to the collective anticipation, the situation escalated rapidly.

"Beep!"

The heart rate monitor on Dominic's wrist suddenly blared an alarm. His pulse had skyrocketed from 80 to 120 bpm in seconds.

This was the same man who'd remained stone-faced through videos of gorgeous models, handsome actors, adorable babies, and even explicit love scenes. Yet Evelyn's mere presence had shattered his composure completely.

'Fascinating,' the guests murmured, exchanging knowing looks.

The piercing alarm seemed to physically strike both Dominic and Evelyn.

Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson. She buried her face in her hands, mortified. Dominic reacted differently - he ripped off the monitor and flung it across the room.

'Damn that infernal device,' he cursed internally.

His expression was a storm of embarrassment and irritation. The guests struggled to contain their amusement - until Lucas lost the battle and burst out laughing. The dam broke, and soon the entire living room echoed with raucous laughter.

Evelyn wrenched her wrist free and fled toward the nearest exit. Her furious gaze locked onto the obvious instigator - Sophie.

Dragging her friend into a guest room, Evelyn slammed the door. "Sophie Mercer! Have you lost your mind?!"

Sophie couldn't stop giggling. "It was deliberate. Don't you want to know why he showed up unannounced? I suspected he came for you, but needed proof... Well, now we have it!"

Evelyn was speechless.

"Don't be angry," Sophie pleaded. "I did it for you. Now that we know he's still obsessed, you can avoid him properly! The man's terrifying - you stabbed him and he still won't let go! I'm almost impressed."

Evelyn's anger didn't dissipate. She hadn't wanted this confirmation. After finally finding peace, this confrontation had thrown everything into chaos again. How could she face him now?

"I'm sorry," Sophie said contritely. "Stay here tonight. I'll tell you when they leave."

Though furious, Evelyn wouldn't ruin Sophie's wedding eve. "Fine. Go enjoy your party. I'm going to shower." She opened the door to let Sophie out.

Back in the living room...

Having failed the challenge, Dominic and Lucas had to drink an entire bottle each.

Lucas sipped his drink leisurely from a glass. Dominic took a different approach - he raised the bottle to his lips and downed the entire contents in one long, desperate gulp.

###Chapter 450

No one forced Dominic to drink.

After he emptied the bottle, Lucas studied him with a frown. "Is your injury fully healed? Didn't the doctor say no alcohol for three months? It hasn't been that long yet, has it?"

Adrian overheard and quickly grabbed a bottle of juice.

"Dominic, have some juice instead!" He cleared the wine bottles from the table. "There's still food in the kitchen. Either of you hungry?"

Lucas finished his own drink and pulled Dominic toward the kitchen. The moment they left, the tension in the living room dissolved instantly.

Lucas poured a glass of juice and handed it to Dominic.

"If I'd known it would be this awkward, I wouldn’t have brought you," Lucas muttered, rubbing his temple. "Want me to take you back?"

Adrian hovered nearby. "You both drank—neither of you can drive. I booked an ambulance earlier. Maybe you could take that back?"

Both men stared at him, stunned.

Seeing their expressions, Adrian backtracked. "Or… if you don’t want to leave, you can stay. I rented eight mansions. Plenty of rooms."

Lucas blinked. "Why did you book an ambulance?"

"Evelyn skipped lunch today. Sophie had to help her upstairs. I was worried she might collapse, so I called one just in case." Adrian shrugged. "This place is in the middle of nowhere. Nearest hospital’s miles away."

Lucas frowned deeper. "Why didn’t she eat?"

"No idea. Sophie wouldn’t let me ask. Said I was on Dominic’s side." Adrian glanced at Dominic. "Not that she hates him—she’s just protective of Evelyn. Can’t blame her. They’ve been friends for years."

Dominic’s face was flushed from the wine, but his gaze remained sharp. "Did she eat dinner?"

"Think so. Sophie drove out and got her spicy chicken soup. Evelyn seemed fine when she came down. Must’ve eaten."

Dominic took a slow sip of juice.

Adrian suddenly remembered something. "Oh—she ate a ton of fruit this morning, though. Nothing else. Just fruit. Sophie had it shipped from overseas. I wondered why she ordered so much, but then I saw how happy Evelyn was eating it."

Silence settled between them.

After a moment, Lucas smirked. "Guess she’s really dieting, then. My ex did that—ate nothing but fruit. Wouldn’t touch anything with gluten. Too much sugar."

Adrian tilted his head. "Fruit has sugar too, doesn’t it?"

"Still better than gluten. They count every calorie." Lucas rolled his eyes. "She wasn’t even fat. Just a little soft. But when she found out all my exes were skinny? Went nuts. I dumped her before she starved herself to death."

Adrian hesitated. "So… you think Evelyn’s dieting for… someone?"

Lucas glanced at Dominic’s darkening expression and grinned. "Probably for Eric."

The air turned icy.

Adrian grabbed a wine glass, desperate to lighten the mood. "Lucas, if you’re staying, let’s drink."

"Depends on Dominic. If he leaves, I’m going with him. If not, I’ll stay."

Dominic stood abruptly. "You two enjoy."

Adrian followed him. "Need to rest?"

A low hum was his only answer.

"I’ll show you to the guest room next door." Adrian reached for his arm, but Dominic jerked away.

"Leave me alone."

###Chapter 451 "I'm going to find Evelyn."

'This is madness! Absolute madness!' Adrian thought, his pulse racing. He hadn't witnessed the previous physical altercation between Evelyn and Dominic, but the memory of Dominic spending weeks in the ICU afterward still haunted him. Now Dominic wanted to confront Evelyn again when their last conflict remained unresolved. Was he deliberately walking into the same disaster?

Adrian's hands trembled. Unable to stop Dominic himself, he dashed to find Lucas and Sophie.

"He only had one drink," Lucas analyzed with calm precision. "He can't possibly be that intoxicated."

"But Evelyn explicitly said she doesn't want to see him!" Sophie countered, her voice tight with anxiety. "She told me this herself! No, I have to stop him!"

Sophie made to rush upstairs, but Adrian and Lucas each grabbed one of her arms, holding her back.

"Wait, Sophie. Let me check on them first." Lucas worried that if Sophie intervened, the entire household would know what was happening. Dominic had already humiliated himself once; Lucas wanted to preserve what little dignity his friend had left.

"Let Lucas handle this!" Adrian pulled Sophie into a firm embrace. "Don't worry, nothing serious will happen as long as Lucas is there."

Meanwhile, on the second floor...

Evelyn stepped out of the shower wrapped in a white silk robe.

Having slept most of the day and enjoyed a satisfying dinner, she felt refreshed after her shower. So when she saw Dominic standing before her, she didn't doubt her eyes or think it a hallucination.

Dominic closed the distance between them in three long strides, his gaze burning into her. "You're starving yourself for Eric?"

The absurdity of his accusation made her blink.

She understood each word perfectly, yet the implication was ridiculous. That she would alter her eating habits for any man's approval? Preposterous!

'What kind of twisted logic produced that assumption? Do I need to change myself for a man's attention? Besides, if I wanted Eric, I wouldn't need to lose weight - he's never once commented on my appearance!' she fumed silently.

"Dominic, have you been drinking?" She wrinkled her nose at the alcohol fumes surrounding him. "Have you forgotten you're still recovering? Drinking now... are you trying to sabotage your own health?"

"Why won't you answer my question?" His jaw clenched as his patience evaporated. "You have no right to criticize when you look like death warmed over."

'Death warmed over? How dare he!' The insult burned through her restraint.

Evelyn had intended to avoid confrontation, still guilty about their last violent encounter. But Dominic's provocation shattered her resolve.

"Who I diet for is none of your concern." Evelyn pointed sharply toward the door, her voice icy. "Get out!"

Dominic's temper ignited at her dismissive gesture.

"Does he know about us?" Dominic sneered, his voice dripping with malice. "Would your precious Eric still want you if he knew we've been sharing a bed?"

###Chapter 452

Evelyn's gaze locked onto Dominic's strikingly handsome yet impassive face, her anger rendering her momentarily speechless. In the past, she would have argued fiercely, but her weakened state drained her of the energy to fight.

If Dominic insisted on shamelessly staying in her room, there was little she could do. The man had clearly abandoned all sense of dignity.

Dominic frowned, surprised by her subdued reaction. "Was I not clear enough? Or has she already discussed this with Eric?" he wondered darkly.

"Evelyn Thorne, I won't release you no matter who you end up with," he threatened, his voice low and dangerous. "You're not marrying anyone else while I still draw breath."

His words barely registered. Marriage was the furthest thing from her mind, making his threats meaningless.

"Are you that desperate to be the 'other man'?" she mocked, meeting his gaze directly.

A flicker of discomfort crossed Dominic's features at her barb.

"If I'm in a relationship with Eric and you keep harassing me, then you're nothing but a homewrecker," Evelyn pressed, seizing his momentary silence.

To her astonishment, Dominic recovered swiftly. "So what if I am?" he drawled, his lips curling. "I don't mind playing that role."

'Unbelievable,' she thought. 'The man has no shame.'

Pushing past him, Evelyn moved to the bed and retrieved her skincare products. Pregnancy had forced her to abandon her usual routine - the scents became unbearable, the ingredients potentially harmful.

After weeks of parched skin, Sophie had gifted her a specially formulated set - fragrance-free and pregnancy-safe. The relief had been immediate.

Dominic watched her apply the products with growing suspicion. This newfound skincare regimen? Definitely for another man.

The Evelyn he knew barely bothered with such routines after showers.

Feeling his stare, she looked up. "What?" She snapped the lid shut. "Need something else? Surely you're not planning to sleep here tonight?"

Her words reminded him of the wine's lingering effects. His head swam slightly as he strode forward and sat boldly on the edge of her bed.

"I can't?" he challenged.

"Do you really think three adults could fit on this bed?" she countered.

Dominic's confusion showed as he assessed the spacious but insufficient bed. "Who exactly are you planning to sleep with tonight?"

"Sophie, obviously!" Evelyn gestured to the emerald clutch on the dresser. "That's her purse."

Dominic sprang up as if electrocuted.

Evelyn suppressed a laugh. She might escape him tonight, but what about tomorrow? Next week?

She'd assumed their last confrontation would have broken him. Instead, his obsession seemed to intensify. She'd never encountered such relentless determination.

Sobering instantly, Dominic turned on his heel and left without another word.

###Chapter 453 by Silent Echoes

Evelyn's voice trembled as she called out, "Dominic, if I give you a child like we agreed... will you promise to stay away from me after that?"

She couldn't bear this entanglement any longer.

Dominic froze mid-step before turning with icy precision. "First deliver my child, then we'll negotiate terms."

The door slammed behind him with finality.

Lucas stood waiting in the hallway, concern etching his features. "Dominic, is everything alright?"

Evelyn heard every word. A familiar frustration bubbled up - that uncontrollable storm of emotions only he could provoke.

She collapsed onto the bed the moment their footsteps faded. After several steadying breaths, she reached for her phone and video-called Michael.

Michael answered instantly. "Evelyn! Have you eaten dinner?"

The screen showed him sitting with Henry and Lily in their living room. A shadow moved in the kitchen background before Michael quickly adjusted the camera angle.

"I have..." Evelyn's tension eased at the sight of her children. "Henry, Lily, what are you two doing?"

"We're doing puzzles! But Henry won't let me help. He says I'm ruining it." Lily pouted dramatically. "Mommy, Uncle Nathan cooked for us today!"

Michael groaned. "Lily! We had a deal!"

"But Mommy wouldn't be mad!" Lily countered with innocent defiance.

"Michael," Evelyn sighed, "did you forget about our security cameras? I saw Nathan's car in our driveway hours ago."

Lily burst into giggles. "Silly uncle!"

"Aren't you supposed to be relaxing on vacation? Why are checking security feeds?" Michael's brow furrowed. "Wait - are you in bed? What's going on? If you're just sleeping there, why even go—"

"An unexpected visitor arrived," Evelyn cut in, avoiding specifics.

Michael's eyes widened. "Don't tell me Dominic showed up? I thought he wasn't attending!"

"Let's not discuss him."

Michael carried the phone outside, unaware Nathan had followed until his face appeared beside Michael's.

"Evelyn, is he causing problems again? That absolute—"

"He wouldn't dare with so many witnesses," Evelyn assured.

"So he would without them?" Michael's voice rose an octave.

"Calm down. What happened last time won't repeat."

"How can I stay calm when he's—"

Nathan snatched the phone. "Evelyn, I've reviewed Mr. Blackwood's medical records myself. He's perfectly healthy - not unstable, just... uncompromising. He won't harm you if you avoid provoking him."

Nathan wasn't wrong. Dominic wasn't irrational - Evelyn simply lost all self-control around him.

It baffled her. Normally poised in every situation, she transformed into someone else entirely with Dominic. One cutting remark from him, and she'd return tenfold.

"Nathan, I didn't provoke him today," Evelyn admitted awkwardly. "Thank you for cooking for the children."

"My pleasure. When Michael mentioned your bodyguard took leave today..."

Evelyn's lips twitched. "The bodyguard didn't request leave, did he? This was your scheme, Michael?"

'???' Michael thought, 'Must you expose me so bluntly?'

The call ended with Evelyn smiling - until the doorknob twisted abruptly. The door swung open before she could react...

###Chapter 454

"Evelyn!" Sophie burst into the room with dramatic flair. "You won't believe what Dominic just told my fiancé!"

Evelyn's body tensed as she sat up abruptly from the bed. Her mind raced - why would he seek out Adrian? Unless...

"He announced he wouldn't attend our wedding, then changed his mind this evening!" Sophie's words tumbled out in an excited rush. "Now he's coming tomorrow! How fickle can one man be?"

A quiet sigh of relief escaped Evelyn's lips.

"Wait - why was he looking for you anyway? What did you two discuss?" Sophie perched on the edge of the bed, studying Evelyn's face intently. "He didn't give you any trouble, did he? I wanted to intervene but Lucas insisted on handling it..."

"Nothing happened," Evelyn replied evenly. "There were too many witnesses for him to make a scene."

"Good. Now - want to get some fresh air? The evening breeze is perfect - not too chilly!" Sophie suggested brightly. "No way you're sleeping this early."

Evelyn nodded without hesitation. "I don't have proper clothes though. Is this nightgown acceptable?"

Sophie's laughter rang out. "Half the guests are lounging by the pool in swimsuits! Your nightgown is practically formal wear!" She grabbed Evelyn's hand, pulling her toward the door.

The clock showed seven in the evening as elongated shadows stretched beneath the warm glow of streetlamps.

Dozens of wedding guests mingled along the moonlit shoreline.

The temperature hovered around sixty degrees - cool enough to be refreshing without being uncomfortable.

The salty ocean air cleared Evelyn's thoughts. "Dominic could use some of this sea breeze," she murmured absently.

Perhaps nature could restore his common sense.

"Hmm? I think he retired already. When he spoke to Adrian earlier, his face was flushed and his eyes bloodshot. Pathetic alcohol tolerance." Sophie's bare feet sank into the soft sand as she continued, "He insisted on staying in our villa complex... so Adrian gave up his room. Honestly Evelyn, how did you ever date such an eccentric man?"

"That's a past I'd rather not revisit."

Evelyn feared recalling the good memories with Dominic. During their relationship, the sweet moments had outweighed the bitter ones - he'd once cherished her above all else.

Back then, he consumed her thoughts completely outside of her studies. First loves carved permanent marks precisely because they introduced emotions never before experienced.

"Yet you're the one who brought him up first," Sophie teased mercilessly. "Seeing him tonight stirred something, didn't it? Especially after his little public declaration."

"We showed him videos of supermodels and celebrities earlier - zero reaction! His heart only responds to you... Evelyn, my friends are green with envy!" Sophie's grin widened. "When did you become such a femme fatale? Beauty truly lies in the beholder's eye, I suppose."

Evelyn cringed at the exaggerated praise.

"We actually argued tonight." Evelyn recounted the confrontation, adding, "He assumed I'm dieting for Eric's benefit."

"Seriously? What an absurd imagination! Next he'll claim you're preparing for a Hollywood debut!" Sophie dissolved into laughter.

"At my age? Modern idols debut before twenty, don't they?"

"Some break in later, but they're exceptions. So what did you tell him?" Sophie wiped mirthful tears from her eyes.

###Chapter 455

"I didn't give him a straight answer," Evelyn said with a careless shrug.

"That's cruel," Sophie gasped, clutching her friend's arm. "You're stringing him along! You know Dominic has feelings for you, yet you refuse to be honest with him."

Evelyn shook her head, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "It's not worth the effort. He's being completely irrational."

N?velDrama.Org exclusive content.

"Well, that's true. You two aren't back together... But tell me, is there any chance you'd reconsider?" Sophie's grip tightened as the wind played with Evelyn's dark locks.

"How could we?" Evelyn scoffed. "He still hasn't explained what's going on with Sophia. And every time I remember he was once involved with Zoe, it makes my skin crawl. I'd rather be alone forever than go back to him."

"I don't blame you for feeling that way," Sophie huffed. "If he didn't care about Zoe, he shouldn't have gotten her pregnant! That's exactly why I keep calling him a scumbag. How dare he act like some devoted lover now? Disgusting!"

Evelyn let out a dry laugh. "I used to get furious just thinking about him, but today... I don't feel as angry. Something ridiculous happened, actually. He said he wants to be my lover just to ruin my current relationship so I can't get married."

Sophie froze for a full three seconds before bursting into uncontrollable laughter.

"Are we talking about the same Dominic Blackwood?" she wheezed, clutching her stomach. "My husband would never believe me if I told him this!"

"Maybe he'd had too much to drink," Evelyn mused, still processing the absurdity of it all.

Dominic could be shameless at times, but this level of childishness was unheard of.

"He only had one bottle. There's no way he was that drunk." Sophie wiped tears from her eyes. "He's obsessed with you but can't have you, so the thought of you marrying someone else is driving him mad. You'd better pray you don't meet your soulmate anytime soon, or things are going to get very... complicated."

Evelyn tilted her head back, gazing at the star-studded sky. The constellations twinkled like scattered diamonds.

'I just hope everything goes smoothly at Sophie's wedding tomorrow,' she thought.

Morning arrived in the blink of an eye.

Sophie and Adrian's wedding was being held at the most luxurious five-star hotel in Ravenshore.

Lily and Henry woke at dawn, demanding to be taken to the hotel immediately to see their mother. Michael had no choice but to drag himself out of bed to chauffeur the excited children.

To their surprise, guests had already begun arriving in droves, filling the hotel restaurant with lively chatter.

"Stay close to me and don't wander off," Michael warned, gripping a steaming cup of coffee. "I know you're both smart, but we can't take risks. Your mom's making serious money now. What if some creep tries to kidnap you for ransom?"

Fear flashed across Lily and Henry's faces. Terrified by the thought, Lily immediately clutched Michael's sleeve while Henry grabbed a plate and headed straight for the buffet.

Suddenly, a hand landed on Henry's shoulder. He turned to see a woman with piercing blue eyes staring down at him.

"Henry Thorne, I know everything," Sophia purred, seizing his wrist. "You're my brother's son, which makes me your aunt."

Henry gaped at her, too stunned to pull away.

"I haven't told Dominic yet," she continued, her grip tightening. "But from now on, you'll call me Aunt Sophia."

Henry yanked his arm free with icy precision. "You're claiming to be Dominic Blackwood's sister? Prove it."

###Chapter 456

Henry's question left Sophia deep in thought. "What kind of proof do you need?"

To Sophia, there was no reason to prove her connection to Dominic. He was her brother, and she was his sister—that had always been the truth.

Henry voiced his doubts. "If you're really Dominic's sister, why isn't your name in the Blackwood family records? Do you even have an ID? Show it to me."

Sophia wasn’t sure if she had one, but she could ask Dominic for it.

"I’ll get you the proof!" she insisted. "I am your aunt."

Sophia believed every word Mrs. Pembroke had told her. When the woman had said she and Dominic shared the same mother, Dominic himself had confirmed it.

If they had the same mother, they were undeniably siblings.

"I won’t accept it until you show me proof," Henry snapped coldly before walking away, tea in hand.

Sophia watched him leave, frustration bubbling inside her. If only Dominic were here—she could’ve gotten the proof immediately.

Henry returned to Michael, who raised an eyebrow. "What did Sophia say? I thought Dominic wasn’t coming, but if she’s here, maybe he’s planning to show up after all."

Henry’s expression darkened. "She didn’t say much."

Michael softened when he noticed Sophia still watching them. "We don’t have to be so harsh on someone who’s… you know."

"She’s not as slow as she used to be," Henry muttered.

"Ah. Well, I never doubted your mom’s skills."

A flicker of pride crossed Henry’s face.

"Your mom, though… she’s been acting strange lately. You’ve seen it. She barely eats, she’s gotten so thin… If Dominic tries to take her again, he won’t even need to use force. It’s bad enough she won’t exercise, but giving up like this?"

Henry’s jaw tightened. "We could check her phone. See what’s really going on."

Michael hesitated. "You’re not scared?"

"Of course I am! She’s your mom, not mine. If you mess up, she’ll just scold you. If I mess up, she’ll kick me out!"

Michael considered it, then grinned. "Alright, Big H. Let’s do it. If she finds out, we take the blame together, deal?"

Henry nodded.

After breakfast, Michael left to grab his laptop while Henry and Lily waited in the event hall.

The moment Michael was gone, Sophia approached them.

"I brought gifts for you two." She pulled a sparkling prism from her purse. "Lily, this is for you. It’s a rainbow maker! Hang it by your window, and when the sun hits it, your whole room will glow with colors!"

Lily’s eyes lit up. "Sophia… thank you! Even though Henry said not to talk to you, I love this!"

Sophia frowned at Henry. "Why would you tell her that? I’m your aunt—"

"Proof!" Henry cut in sharply.

Sophia beamed. "I will show you."

"Even if you do, I’m not calling you Auntie. I don’t want Dominic as my father. I don’t accept him!"

Sophia’s throat tightened. "You don’t have to accept him… but you have to accept me. I’ve never done anything bad to either of you!"

Henry fell silent. As strange as her logic was, she wasn’t wrong.

###Chapter 457 by Silent Echoes

It was Dominic who had nearly strangled him to death, and it was Dominic who tormented his mother. Sophia had never laid a finger on them. Michael returned with his laptop, flashing a warm smile when he spotted Evelyn. "Hey, Evelyn!"

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably under his gaze.

Michael's expression softened. "Did you come alone?"

"My brother's joining me later," she replied.

"Ah. How's your injury healing? Any lingering headaches?" His eyes flickered to her stylish wig as his fingers twitched toward it.

She shook her head. "Only hurts when touched."

Leaning closer, Michael parted his own hair to reveal a matching scar. "Look - battle wounds from the same war."

Evelyn blinked in surprise before chuckling. "You got hurt too?"

"Yep! But I'm all better now, so you'd better recover quickly!"

"I will! There's something important waiting for me when I do."

"Oh? What's that?"

Evelyn's smile faltered as she abruptly retreated to her security detail.

After her departure, Henry and Lily squeezed beside Michael, watching intently as he attempted to hack into their mother's phone for clues about her sudden loss of appetite.

Their surveillance was interrupted by Evelyn's unexpected arrival.

Missing her children desperately, she'd come early. Spotting Michael's laptop screen, she asked innocently, "What are you working on?"

Michael nearly jumped out of his skin, slamming the laptop shut with a bang.

"Mommy!" Lily launched herself at Evelyn. "You look like a princess!"

Evelyn wore the elegant gown purchased during her shopping trip with Sophie. Though slightly loose, the dress draped beautifully.

Sophie had arranged a professional glam squad - Evelyn's makeup had been expertly applied by a celebrity artist.

Her dark tresses were swept into an elegant updo, the soft makeup enhancing her natural beauty with understated grace.

"You're my beautiful princess, sweetheart! Who did your hair?" Evelyn lifted Lily before remembering her pregnancy and gently setting her down.

"Uncle Michael did it..."

The mention refocused Evelyn's attention. "Michael, what exactly were you doing just now? Who were you hacking?"

Michael batted his baby blues. "Nothing! Just...system maintenance."

"Really? You brought a laptop to a wedding for system maintenance?" Evelyn settled beside him with raised eyebrows.

"I always keep one in the car! We arrived painfully early - these two woke me at dawn demanding to find you at the hotel. See these bags under my eyes?" He pointed dramatically.

Evelyn studied his face, then suddenly looked past him.

Michael followed her gaze.

'Fantastic. Dominic's here,' he thought dryly.

Dominic commanded attention the moment he entered the venue. When Sophia spotted him, she dashed over and seized his hand.

Instead of pulling away, Dominic wrapped his arm possessively around her waist, their intimacy on full display. Evelyn watched, her expression darkening like storm clouds rolling in.

"Dominic, do I have my own ID card?" Sophia asked, her eyes wide with curiosity.

"Why are you asking about this suddenly?" Dominic responded, glancing at her.

"Because everyone has one, and I want mine too."

"You do have one, but it's kept at home."

"Oh... Can you give it to me when we go back?" Sophia smiled hopefully.

"Why do you need it?" Dominic guided her to an empty seat.

"It's my ID, so I should keep it with me." Sophia opened her purse and pulled out a brand-new phone. "Look, Dominic, I bought this myself. Now I can make calls."

Dominic raised an eyebrow and turned to the bodyguard standing nearby.

The bodyguard quickly explained, "Miss Sophia purchased it yesterday while shopping. She even registered a SIM card using Mrs. Whitaker's ID."

Sophia had changed so much that Dominic was momentarily stunned. Pride swelled in his chest. "Sophia, you can register a SIM card with your own ID now."

"Okay! When are we going home?" She practically bounced in her seat with excitement.

"We'll leave after lunch. Don’t worry, your ID is safe with me."

Sophia nodded eagerly and turned on her phone. "Dominic, can you show me how to use it?"

"Of course," he replied, his voice patient.

"Evelyn, stop staring. Your eyes are about to fall out of your head," Michael teased, waving a hand in front of her face.

Evelyn blinked and looked away, embarrassed.

Dominic was teaching Sophia how to use her phone, his demeanor gentle and attentive. It had been so long since Evelyn had seen him like this that she couldn’t help but watch.

She took a sip of water from her glass, trying to hide the unease creeping up her throat.

"Where’s Eric? He should be sitting next to you, right?" Michael checked his watch.

Evelyn nodded. "What did you all do yesterday at the mansion? Did you have fun?" Michael refilled her glass as she finished the water.

"I slept most of the time."

"Oh? Did you eat anything?"

"I had some spicy chicken soup." Just the memory of it made her stomach growl.

She had eaten breakfast earlier, but it hadn’t stayed down for long. If it weren’t for Sophie’s wedding, she wouldn’t have bothered. This pregnancy’s morning sickness was relentless.

"I talked to Nathan last night," Michael lowered his voice, leaning in. "I told him I’ve never seen you diet before, and you’re not seeing anyone, yet you refuse to eat... Guess what he said?"

Evelyn’s pulse quickened at the knowing look on Michael’s face.

"He said women lose their appetite when they’re pregnant. His sister was the same way—she couldn’t keep anything down."

Before Michael could finish, Evelyn clapped a hand over her mouth, gagging.

Michael froze in shock.

"Mom!" Lily shrieked, alarmed.

Henry immediately grabbed the tissue box and handed one to Evelyn.

Dominic heard Lily’s cry and turned sharply. His dark eyes locked onto Evelyn, and before he knew it, he was striding toward her.

Why did Lily scream? What’s wrong with Evelyn?

"I’m fine," Evelyn managed, though the nausea lingered. The way she looked at Michael was tinged with guilt.

Michael had already pieced it together. Her expression gave her away.

She was pregnant.

Wedding staff rushed over, calling for a doctor, but Evelyn waved them off. "I’m okay, really."

They hesitated but eventually left after confirming she wasn’t in distress.

Dominic remained beside her, studying her carefully. Her makeup masked any paleness, but he couldn’t shake the feeling something was off.

###Chapter 459

"What are you doing here? Came for the show?" Michael sneered, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

Dominic ignored him completely, his long strides carrying him straight to the empty seat beside Evelyn. Without hesitation, he sat down.

Evelyn stiffened, her fingers tightening around her napkin. "That's Eric's seat," she said quietly.

"This is my seat," Dominic growled, his jaw clenched. "Don't worry. He'll still be at this table."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn—Dominic must have gone to Adrian to have his seat changed.

Once Dominic settled in, Sophia walked over and took the seat next to him.

Noticing Evelyn's discomfort, Michael immediately stood up to switch places with her. But before he could speak, Sophia beat him to it.

"Michael, can we switch seats?" she asked sweetly, her eyes flickering toward Henry.

Michael hesitated, unsure how to refuse, but Sophia didn’t give him the chance. She was already moving toward his seat, leaving him no choice but to surrender it.

Now, even if Michael switched with Evelyn, she would still end up sitting beside Dominic.

Gritting his teeth, Michael turned to Dominic. "Let’s switch seats. What do you say?"

"No."

Michael glared at him, but Dominic didn’t even spare him a glance.

Time slipped by, and soon, the clock struck noon. The wedding ceremony began.

Dominic barely glanced at the stage, his attention elsewhere. Evelyn, however, was absorbed in the moment, snapping photos throughout the ceremony.

When it came time for the bouquet toss, Sophie glanced once in Evelyn’s direction before turning and hurling the bouquet toward her with all her strength.

A sharp "Whew!" cut through the air—and Dominic caught it effortlessly. The crowd erupted into cheers.

Evelyn froze.

Dominic didn’t hand her the bouquet. He had no intention of letting her marry someone else. Instead, he thrust it into Michael’s hands.

"Thanks," Michael muttered, bewildered.

As the ceremony ended, the lights dimmed, and a familiar melody filled the hall.

The crowd went wild.

"Eric! Eric!"

Eric’s smooth, captivating voice filled the room, leaving everyone in awe.

Dominic’s gaze locked onto Evelyn, but she wasn’t looking at the stage like everyone else. She was quietly eating, picking at the cold dishes and vegetables, avoiding the meat.

His jaw tightened. He speared a piece of pork rib with his fork and dropped it onto her plate. She used to love them.

She stared at it, then at him. "I don’t want it. Take it away."

If he didn’t, she’d probably lose the little she’d already eaten. But Dominic didn’t budge. "Eat."

Evelyn’s head throbbed.

Just then, little Lily reached over, pulling Evelyn’s plate toward her. She devoured the pork rib in seconds.

"Mom, switch seats with me! I’m not scared of this bad guy!"

Evelyn smiled weakly. "It’s okay, sweetheart. I’m not scared of him either." She set her fork down, appetite gone.

Eric’s performance ended, and he stepped off the stage.

Michael immediately intercepted him. "Switch seats with Evelyn, and I’ll switch with you."

Within moments, Evelyn was separated from Dominic, with Eric now sitting between them.

Sensing the tension, Eric glanced at Dominic. "Hello, Mr. Blackwood."

Dominic’s dark eyes burned into Evelyn. His voice was low, dangerous.

"Evelyn. Are you pregnant?"

###Chapter 460

Dominic had texted his family physician earlier, detailing Evelyn's peculiar symptoms. The doctor's response was straightforward—she was either seriously ill or expecting.

Dominic immediately dismissed the first possibility. Evelyn was a trained physician herself. If she were terminally ill, she wouldn't have attended Sophie's wedding festivities, let alone the wild bachelorette party the previous night.

But what else could explain such dramatic weight loss in such a short time?

And then there was her sudden aversion to meat, sticking strictly to fruits and vegetables. Weren't these classic pregnancy symptoms?

The entire table fell silent when Dominic voiced his suspicion.

Michael's jaw tightened in irritation. He hadn't expected Dominic to figure it out so quickly. "Evelyn isn't pregnant," he lied through gritted teeth.

Evelyn's pulse raced. She kept her gaze lowered, yet could feel Dominic's piercing stare burning into her. She could have echoed Michael's denial, but what was the point? A simple test would reveal the truth.

How could she explain the morning sickness? Or her sudden revulsion to the pork ribs he'd placed on her plate?

Dominic wasn't one to be easily deceived. Knowing this, Evelyn grabbed her clutch and stood abruptly.

All eyes turned to her, questioning her sudden movement.

Dominic mirrored her action, striding purposefully toward her. His fingers closed around her wrist like a vice as he pulled her from the reception hall.

Sophie, mid-toast, noticed their departure and rushed over. "Where are they going? What's happening?"

Michael met Sophie's concerned gaze. "Sophie, did you know Evelyn is pregnant?"

Sophie's eyes darted away guiltily.

"Evelyn's pregnant?!" Adrian gasped dramatically. "That's insane! Does everyone know? Does Dominic know?"

Michael arched a brow. "What do you think?"

Adrian rubbed his hands together excitedly. "This is fantastic news! Why does everyone look so grim?"

No one shared his enthusiasm—least of all Dominic, judging by the stormy expression he'd worn when dragging Evelyn away. Adrian's eyes widened with sudden realization. "Wait... is the baby not Dominic's?!"

Sophie couldn't bear to hear more and dragged her fiancé away.

Dominic pulled Evelyn into the elevator, his grip unrelenting. As the doors slid shut, the air between them grew thick with tension.

Evelyn had never imagined Dominic would discover her pregnancy like this—in the middle of a wedding reception, surrounded by their friends.

She studied his reflection in the elevator's polished metal walls.

His jaw was clenched, lips pressed into a thin line. A tempest of emotions raged behind his steely gaze.

The possibility of Evelyn carrying his child wasn't entirely unexpected—they'd been intimate many times without protection. But the timing of this revelation caught him off guard.

What infuriated him most was her secrecy.

Why hadn't she told him? Unless... the child wasn't his?

The thought made Dominic's blood run cold. Without a word, he changed their destination to the nearest hospital.

In the sterile hospital corridor, the ultrasound room door swung open. Dominic emerged clutching the grainy image in one hand while his other maintained an iron grip on Evelyn's wrist.

The moment the elevator doors closed behind them, he exploded. "Evelyn Thorne," he growled, shoving the ultrasound toward her, "who's the father?" According to the scan, she was already eight weeks along.

###Chapter 461 Yet He Had Just Discovered It

Evelyn locked eyes with Dominic, his gaze burning with fury, and snapped in frustration, "You always find new ways to humiliate me!"

'Who else's child would it be?' She thought bitterly. 'Michael's? Or Adrian's?'

"If it's mine, why keep it from me?!" Dominic's accusation came from a place of deep-seated trauma, his mind flashing back to painful memories from five years ago.

This wasn't the first time she'd hidden a pregnancy from him. The deception cut deep, making him feel like a fool being manipulated in the dark.

"Aren't you exhausted by this, Dominic?" Evelyn studied his furious expression before continuing with weary desperation, "I know I am... So tired... No matter what happens, you always find reasons to blame me! What am I to you? What exactly do you think of me?"

Her finger jabbed at the elevator button.

Dominic glanced at the display - they'd only reached the third floor.

As the doors slid open, Evelyn stormed out.

Dominic followed close behind, his pulse racing. "Evelyn Thorne! What are you thinking?"

"I'm terminating this pregnancy!" Her eyes blazed with resentment as she shouted hoarsely, "I'm done! This child would only suffer if born! If that's its fate, why should I carry it?!"

Five years ago, Dominic had forced her into an abortion. Never had he imagined history would repeat itself like this.

Her words struck like a dagger to his heart, the pain so intense he could barely breathe.

Acting on pure instinct, he grabbed her arm.

"You will not abort our child!" His grip tightened as his eyes reddened. "You're keeping it! Even if it's deformed, you're having this baby!"

'Deformed? That's how he describes his own child?' Hot tears spilled down her cheeks as she screamed, "You're the monster here! You!"

When she couldn't free her arms, she kicked violently at his shins.

The maternity ward bustled around them - women here for abortions, others celebrating positive tests. While couples often argued about pregnancies, rarely did they see a woman demanding termination while the man fought to keep the baby.

As someone pulled out a phone to record, Dominic's bodyguard intervened.

Scooping Evelyn into his arms, Dominic marched back toward the elevator.

'She's too emotional. I need to get her away before she does something reckless,' he thought.

"Put me down! I can walk!" Her fists pounded his chest, but he held firm.

Once outside the hospital, he carried her toward the parking lot.

The bodyguard rushed ahead to open the car door.

Not wanting to make a scene, Evelyn buried her face against Dominic's chest. Once inside, she demanded coldly, "Take me home. My home."

Dominic slid in beside her and shut the door.

"Where to, Mr. Blackwood?" the bodyguard asked from the driver's seat.

"Her place," Dominic rasped.

With Evelyn pregnant, he couldn't risk further upsetting her - not when it might affect the baby.

As the car pulled away, Evelyn regained composure and retrieved her phone from her purse.

Dominic studied her flushed profile turned toward the window, swallowing hard. "Evelyn, I forbid you from terminating this pregnancy! Not without my consent. Don't even consider it!"
###Chapter 462

Her emerald eyes burned with fury. "What if I lose this baby?"

The question lodged like a knife in Dominic's throat, stealing his voice.

"This pregnancy isn't even stable yet!" Evelyn's hands trembled as she gripped her purse. "If you keep pushing me like this every damn day, I swear I'll miscarry." The satisfaction of watching his shocked expression sent adrenaline coursing through her veins.

His lips parted, then closed without sound. The memory of her broken form in that hospital bed stopped him. She'd had countless opportunities to terminate before now.

Yet she endured the brutal morning sickness. She'd wasted away to nearly nothing but still carried their child. That meant something.

Dominic slowly straightened his tie, regaining his composure.

Evelyn exhaled sharply and checked her phone. Messages from Michael, Sophie, and Eric flooded her screen. She typed quick reassurances to each.

The car glided through Mooncrest Manor's wrought iron gates, stopping before her stone mansion.

When the door unlocked, she bolted out - only to find Dominic mirroring her movements.

"Why are you following me? Go home." She glared across the car's roof, the evening breeze tangling her hair.

"We need to talk."

"About what?" Exhaustion weighed her bones. She wanted nothing more than to collapse into bed.

Yet he stood immobile at her front gate like some marble sentinel. With a frustrated groan, she stomped past him, keycard in hand.

The moment the gate clicked open, he shadowed her up the cobbled path.

It felt like leading a panther into her home. He actually brushed past her at the front door, entering first.

Her jaw dropped as he plucked brand-new slippers from her entryway cabinet. "You're unbelievable, Dominic." She leaned against the doorframe, watching him change shoes with practiced ease. "Weren't you disgusted by the thought of my pregnancy back then? Or have you rewritten history in that perfect memory of yours?"

'As if I could forget,' he thought bitterly. Every agonizing detail was seared into his mind.

"Say whatever you need to, Evelyn." He met her gaze evenly. "If it helps you sleep at night."

"Is this your idea of an apology?" She shoved past him to toss her purse on the console table. "Pretty words to erase the past?"

"My mistakes?" A humorless chuckle escaped him. "I'd make the same choices again without hesitation."

She froze mid-step.

"Did I even know you then?" His voice turned razor-sharp. "Put yourself in my position - waking up married to a stranger carrying my nephew's child. Tell me, what would you have done?"

Her breath hitched.

"That baby could have been anyone's. I couldn't accept it." The raw honesty in his admission lifted an invisible weight from her chest.

"You accuse me of lacking empathy?" She whirled to face him. "How do you think this pregnancy happened? Immaculate conception?"

Dominic blinked, caught off guard.

"It was your mother's scheme! You knew and did nothing." Her nails bit into her palms. "I understand now you forced that abortion because you didn't love me. But understanding doesn't erase the pain."

Rather than anger, something like remorse flickered in his eyes. He'd always considered abortion a simple medical procedure - until her hospital threat made him feel that visceral fear.

Now he wondered if she'd felt that same tearing agony five years ago.

###Chapter 463 by Silent Echoes

Dominic moved toward the living area and paused, waiting for Evelyn to join him.

"Do we have more to discuss?" She edged toward the staircase, desperate to retreat upstairs.

Her fingers curled around the banister.

N?velDrama.Org exclusive content.

"Planning to sleep?" His gaze traced her slender silhouette as his defenses crumbled.

"Yes. But we can talk first if you insist."

Evelyn remained rooted by the stairs, putting distance between them. His scent alone sent waves of pain through her—so achingly familiar, yet their hearts now separated by an impassable gulf.

"Go rest." He sank onto the sofa. "I'll leave shortly."

"Oh..." She averted her eyes and ascended without another word.

The moment Evelyn disappeared upstairs, Dominic surged to his feet. A harsh realization struck him—how blindly self-absorbed he'd been. He'd never truly comprehended her desires. He'd convinced himself he'd given her everything, resenting her rejection, when in truth, he'd offered all the wrong things.

Thirty minutes later, certain she'd fallen asleep, he dialed his private physician.

"Congratulations on fatherhood, Mr. Blackwood," the doctor greeted.

The hospital Evelyn visited belonged to Dominic's medical network.

"Is there any remedy for morning sickness?" His voice tightened.

"None," came the frank reply. "She must endure it. Symptoms typically ease between twelve to sixteen weeks. Since Miss Thorne is only eight weeks along, relief won't come for another month."

"She's wasting away to nothing." Dominic's fists clenched.

"That severe? IV nutrients are an option if she can't keep food down. As a doctor herself, she knows this—unless she's considering termination..."

"She is."

"What? Why?"

"She despises me." A weighted pause. "But I won't let her discard this child."

"Pregnancy hormones amplify emotions. Her rejection may stem from pain, not true intent. She needs patient care now more than ever."

"She refuses to see me."

"Then... perhaps distance is wisest temporarily."

"Impossible." His decision was absolute.

Upstairs, Evelyn changed into soft cotton pajamas but lay wide-eyed, sleep evading her.

He's still here. What's he doing down there? I can't decipher his thoughts anymore.

Does he want this child to be a father, or just to control me?

If I surrender our baby to him after birth, could he even raise it? His temper is volatile—how could I ever trust him with something so precious?

The whirlwind of thoughts threatened to split her skull.

Then—footsteps.

Her eyelids snapped shut.

The door creaked open. Dominic's presence filled the room as he approached.

She expected a brief check, but the mattress dipped under his weight.

Not just sitting.

Lying down beside her.

###Chapter 464 by Silent Echo

Evelyn's body stiffened instantly. With her back turned to Dominic, she couldn't see his expression or guess his intentions.

Her mind raced with possibilities. 'What if he tries something? Should I push him away or pretend to be asleep?'

To her astonishment, he remained motionless after lying down.

His warm breath caressed her neck. She could feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat against her back. As his breathing slowed, his arm suddenly snaked around her waist - that familiar possessive gesture from their passionate past.

Eyes fluttering open, Evelyn found herself lost in bittersweet memories. Silent tears welled up as Dominic slipped into deep slumber behind her.

Gently lifting his arm, she sat up and wiped her damp cheeks. Studying his sleeping form, her gaze drifted downward.

An irresistible urge seized her - she needed to see the scar on his chest. Her fingers trembled as they reached for the first button.

The moment she touched it, Dominic's face twisted in displeasure. Still asleep, he forcefully batted her hand away.

Evelyn blinked in shock. 'How can he be this alert while unconscious? Has he always reacted this way to touch? Then how did he ever... with Zoe?'

The thought plunged her into despair.

Having known no other man, Evelyn couldn't reconcile Dominic's intimacy with another woman. Even if his heart still belonged to her, this betrayal felt unforgivable.

Tears streamed down her face unchecked. Pregnancy hormones made her emotions volatile, but she'd been managing them well - until Dominic shattered her composure so effortlessly.

Suddenly, his eyes flew open.

Caught off guard, Evelyn had no time to compose herself. Dominic took in her distraught state with growing alarm.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?" He sat up instantly, sleep forgotten, and brushed away her tears with rough fingertips. "Why are you crying?"

Flushing with embarrassment, she grasped for an excuse. "I wanted to check your wound, but you pushed me away."

"My apologies. I wasn't fully conscious," Dominic murmured, fingers working his buttons. "It's not a pleasant sight."

When the scar came into view, Evelyn felt mocked by its ugly presence.

Her fingers hovered over the damaged flesh.

Dominic shuddered and caught her wrist. "Don't. It doesn't hurt anymore."

Snatching her hand back, she hissed, "You're insane! Had you died that day, even if your family didn't accuse me, the world would've branded me your murderer! I could've spent life in prison!"

Studying her red-rimmed eyes, Dominic pressed his lips together.

That moment of madness had been pure impulse. Provoked beyond reason by the woman he loved wanting him dead, he'd seen no purpose in living.

"Are you blaming me for wanting you dead?" Evelyn read his silence perfectly. "Thoughts are private. Unless acted upon, they mean nothing!"

###Chapter 465

"Why bring this up now?" Dominic didn't want to argue. There was something far more important between them—their child.

"Why not? Just because we avoid the topic doesn’t mean it’s resolved!" Evelyn knew dwelling on the past was unhealthy, but some wounds needed to be reopened before they could truly heal. Otherwise, they’d fester into something far worse.

Dominic pulled her into his arms, his voice softening. "Weren’t you going to sleep? Did I wake you?"

Before she could react, her cheek pressed against the scorching heat of his bare chest. Panic flared, and she shoved him away, rolling onto her side with her back to him.

Dominic stared at her slender frame, his chest tightening. Evelyn had never told him what his mother said to her before she died. And he lacked the courage to ask.

If she was this upset when he stayed silent, confronting her would only make things worse.

He tugged the blanket over her before settling beside her again.

At six in the evening, Michael and Nathan returned with the children. The moment they stepped into the mansion, they found Evelyn curled up on the couch, watching TV.

"Evelyn, I brought dinner." Michael unpacked the takeout in front of her. "Your favorite fruits, soup, and appetizers. Try them."

One glance at the food, and her stomach growled loudly.

"Mom!" Lily plopped down beside her, pouting. "Why didn’t you tell Henry and me about the baby in your belly? Are we not good enough? I’m mad!"

Evelyn winced. "I’m sorry, Lily. I should’ve told you both. It’s my fault, and I’ll make it up to you."

"Okay… An apology is fine, no need to make it up." Lily reached out to touch Evelyn’s stomach. "Huh? Where’s the baby? I don’t feel anything!"

Evelyn had barely eaten all day, and her stomach was nearly flat from hunger.

Nathan and Michael exchanged glances, their expressions darkening.

"Evelyn!" Michael exploded. "Did that bastard Dominic force you into another abortion?"

Evelyn stayed silent.

Nathan struggled to believe Dominic could be that cruel, but the sight of Evelyn’s pale face and hollow stomach made him waver. To prove he still had a conscience, he declared, "Evelyn, if Mr. Blackwood forced you into this, I’ll resign immediately."

Just then, a towering figure appeared at the top of the stairs.

Both men turned.

Nathan’s knees nearly buckled when he met Dominic’s icy gaze. He clung to Michael’s arm for support.

Dominic descended the stairs, stopping in front of Nathan. "Resigning?"

Nathan swallowed hard, unable to speak under that piercing stare.

Michael, however, was furious. "You bastard! That’s Evelyn’s baby! Who the hell do you think you are, forcing her to get rid of it?"

He lunged forward, but Nathan yanked him back with all his strength.

Evelyn finally snapped. "He didn’t force me. And can you both stop acting like idiots in front of my kids?"

Michael instantly shut up.

Dominic glanced at the food spread out before Evelyn and said to Nathan, "Come, Nathan."

"Y-Yes, Mr. Blackwood. Of course, I’m not resigning… Not if you didn’t force Evelyn to… you know." Nathan stammered as he followed Dominic out.

Silence reclaimed the living room.

"Evelyn, are you insane?" Michael hissed. "You already have two kids, and now you’re having another? What are you, a breeding machine?" His voice dripped with disappointment. "You nearly died last time, and now you’re risking it again for that bastard? Is it worth it?"

Evelyn’s head throbbed. She hadn’t wanted another child—not until Dominic demanded it as compensation. What choice did she have?

"Fine," Michael muttered, shoving his hands in his pockets. "What’s his stance on this? He wants the baby? And then what?"

###Chapter 466

Evelyn lifted her eyes to meet Michael's gaze, her spoon hovering mid-air. "Can we please have one peaceful meal without the interrogation?" she sighed. "We didn't discuss any of what you're implying!"

Michael's eyebrows shot up. "Then what exactly did you and Dominic talk about all afternoon?" He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a dramatic whisper. "And why was he upstairs? Did he sleep in your room? Hmm?"

Rolling her eyes, Evelyn countered, "Do I ever grill you when Nathan stays over?"

"That's completely different!" Michael threw his hands up. "Nathan's my boyfriend. Is Dominic Blackwood your boyfriend?" His lips curled into a teasing smirk. "Or are you planning to remarry your ex-husband?"

Evelyn's fork clattered against her plate.

"You're impossible," she muttered, pressing her fingers to her temples.

"Fine, fine," Michael relented, noticing how thin she'd become. "Eat your dinner before it gets cold."

The soup still steamed as Evelyn brought a spoonful to her lips.

Two pairs of wide eyes watched her every move from across the table.

Evelyn's cheeks pinkened under their scrutiny. "What's with the staring contest?"

"Mommy," Lily whispered, her small hands clutching the table edge, "will you still love Henry and me when the new baby comes?"

Evelyn's heart clenched. "Sweetheart, of course!" She reached across to squeeze Lily's hand. "Nothing could ever change how much I love you both."

It was precisely because she loved them so fiercely that she couldn't risk Dominic discovering their existence.

Lily's shoulders relaxed, but curiosity still danced in her eyes. "Is it a boy baby or a girl baby?"

A chuckle escaped Evelyn's lips.

"It's too early to tell, darling. The baby's still smaller than a blueberry."

Lily's mouth formed a perfect O.

"Really?"

"Even smaller than your pinky fingernail right now!"

The four-year-old gasped, examining her own hand.

"Was Henry and me that tiny too?"

"Every person starts out that small," Evelyn explained gently. "Then we grow bit by bit."

Lily nodded sagely before her next question tumbled out. "Why aren't you eating more? Does the baby not like food?"

Henry, ever the protective older brother, tugged Lily's sleeve. "Come on, let's go finish our puzzle." He shot Evelyn an apologetic look as he led his sister away.

Michael took a long sip of water before settling beside Evelyn.

"You really dropped a bombshell with this pregnancy," he murmured. "You should've prepared the kids first... They've been out of sorts since yesterday."

Evelyn pushed her food around the plate. "Dominic insisted on keeping it."

Michael nearly choked. "Wait - you're giving him custody after the birth?"

"That's the current arrangement," Evelyn admitted. "But things could change."

"Smart thinking." Michael nodded approvingly. "First priority is getting through the pregnancy safely. You shouldn't be working in your condition."

"Morning sickness usually eases after the first trimester. I'll return to the office then."

Michael gave her a pointed look. "Is work worth risking the baby? If anything happens, Dominic will lose his mind."

Evelyn frowned. "Since when do you understand him so well?"

"I don't need to understand him to recognize crazy when I see it!" Michael threw up his hands. "Mark my words - if you miscarry, that man will have you pregnant again before you can blink."

His words twisted like a knife in Evelyn's gut.

Meanwhile, at Blackwood Manor, a Rolls-Royce glided to a stop on the circular driveway. Dominic had barely stepped out when Sophia clung to his arm.

"Big brother, my ID card!" Her anxious eyes searched his face.

Dominic suppressed a sigh. "Which is more important - me or that plastic card?"

Sophia considered this seriously. "Both."

Her unexpected clarity surprised him. Today had been full of miracles - not only was Sophia showing remarkable progress, but Evelyn was carrying his child.

Leading her to his study, Dominic retrieved the precious document. "This is important, Sophia," he said, placing it in her careful hands. "If you ever lose it, you must tell me immediately."

###Chapter 467

Sophia nodded and said, “I’ll keep it safe in my room. I promise I won’t lose it.”

"Good. Have you eaten dinner yet?” Dominic asked.

“Yes! I had dinner at the hotel with Henry.”

“You seem very fond of Henry,” Dominic remarked, recalling how she had switched seats with Michael earlier that afternoon.

In the past, Sophia would never leave his side when they went out.

But today, she had chosen to sit next to Henry instead.

“I like Henry and Lily,” Sophia said.

She had a strong feeling that she wasn’t just Henry’s aunt—but Lily’s as well.

The way Henry and Lily interacted reminded her of her own relationship with Dominic.

Dominic’s mind flashed back to that night in the forest mansion, when he had nearly strangled Henry.

When they met earlier, Henry hadn’t once looked at him.

It was as if the boy was deliberately avoiding him.

Dominic was certain the incident had traumatized him.

Guilt settled heavily in his chest.

He rarely felt guilty about anything—he never acted without reason unless provoked.

If Henry hadn’t pushed him, he wouldn’t have lost control.

Looking back, though, even if Henry had been wrong, Dominic hadn’t handled the situation well either.

At dinner, Sophia suddenly approached him with her ID in hand.

“Why isn’t my last name ‘Blackwood,’ Big Brother? You said we were siblings.”

She had sent a photo of her ID to Henry earlier, and he was the one who had pointed it out.

“Isn’t ‘Sophia’ a beautiful name?” Dominic asked.

“It is, but I want to be a Blackwood too.”

“You’re too special for that name, Sophia. ‘Sophia’ suits you perfectly.”

She hesitated for a moment, then nodded. “Okay, Big Brother.”

She returned to her room and explained everything to Henry.

When Henry checked her ID number, he realized it was an individual account with no direct link to Dominic.

“There’s another way to confirm it,” Henry suggested.

Sophia went back to the dining room, discreetly turning on her phone’s voice recorder.

“Tell me I’m your real little sister, Big Brother,” she said.

Henry had insisted he wouldn’t believe it unless he heard it directly from Dominic.

Dominic set down his fork and studied her. “Why do you want me to say that? Is this really for you?”

He quickly pieced together what was happening when he noticed her hiding her hand behind her back.

“Don’t tell too many people you’re my sister,” he said seriously, holding her gaze. “I’m worried my reputation could put you in danger. If people knew, they might follow you, harass you—or worse.”

Sophia didn’t fully understand, but she nodded. “Then I won’t tell Henry.”

“I’ll announce our relationship when the time is right,” Dominic promised. “You’re still recovering. There’s no need to rush.”

“Okay, Big Brother.”

The next day, Evelyn was trending online—but this time, it wasn’t about a scandal with a man.

It was about her children.

The headlines were explosive: (Goddess or Secret Mother?! The Controversial Evelyn Thorne Has Two Children!)

###Chapter 468 by Silent Echoes

Evelyn's blood ran cold when she saw the viral post that morning.

It wasn't the accusations about her personal life that made her dizzy - it was the unauthorized photos of Lily and Henry splashed across every gossip site.

The grainy paparazzi shots didn't show their full faces, but that didn't matter.

Anyone could recognize those delicate features in the twenty-five leaked images.

The worst part? The post even disclosed the name of Mooncrest Academy.

Her legs trembling, Evelyn stumbled out of bed.

She pounded on Michael's door before barging in without waiting for a response.

"Wake up now!" she demanded, yanking the covers off with desperate strength.

Thank God Michael slept in boxers.

Otherwise, this would have been far more awkward than necessary.

"What's happening?" Michael rubbed his bleary eyes. "Evelyn... is it even dawn yet?"

"It's past seven! The kids will be up soon."

She thrust her phone at him. "Can you get these photos of Lily and Henry taken down? I don't even know how to contact these vultures!"

Michael's gaze sharpened as he scanned the images.

"Consider it done."

He pulled on a shirt and went straight to his computer.

"Someone's clearly targeting you."

"I know. Can you trace who leaked these?" Evelyn's voice shook.

"Absolutely. Just need to hack this account's records - give me twenty minutes." His fingers flew across the keyboard. "Wait here."

"I'll make breakfast."

Michael spun around. "Stay inside! Order delivery. What if you collapse out there?"

Evelyn hesitated, then nodded. "What do you want to eat?"

"Not hungry... just some orange juice if we have any."

"Fridge is stocked. I'll pour you some." She headed to the kitchen.

By 8 AM, #EvelynThorne was trending nationwide.

The revelation about her children spread like wildfire.

But when curious clicks led to the gossip account's profile, confusion erupted across social media.

[Is this some kind of joke? Since when does this celebrity gossip page post satire?]

[I nearly had a heart attack thinking these were Dominic Blackwood's kids! WTF is this??]

[Just spit out my coffee! This account owes me a new keyboard!]

The trending title remained unchanged, but Michael had worked his magic - replacing Lily and Henry's photos with images of baby koalas.

He'd even edited Mooncrest Academy's name to read "Wildlife Sanctuary."

The result? A viral post claiming Evelyn Thorne had given birth to twin koalas attending school at a nature reserve.

Comments flooded in:

[What kind of PR stunt is this?]

[Did Evelyn pay for this ridiculous story?]

As if any sane person would invent something this absurd.

Michael erased every trace of the children's photos from the internet before finally exhaling.

He texted his handiwork to Nathan with a boast:

Michael: [Fastest takedown in history?]

Nathan: [Knew it was you.]

Michael: [You should've seen Evelyn this morning. Meanwhile, your precious boss was MIA as usual.]

Nathan: [Congrats on the save, but lay off Dominic. Not in the mood to argue today.]

Michael: [Fine... I'm hiring a nanny. Can't leave Evelyn alone like this.]

Nathan: [Smart move. Need help?]

Michael: [Wouldn't say no.]

As their conversation ended, Nathan dialed Dominic. The Memorial Day weekend had just entered its second day.

###Chapter 469 by Midnight Whisper

Dominic had spent the entire night tossing and turning, finally drifting into a restless sleep just before dawn.

The shrill ring of his phone jolted him awake.

"Sir, Michael mentioned wanting to hire a nanny for Evelyn. He accepted my offer to assist in the search."

Nathan had received new instructions from Dominic late last night - to monitor Evelyn's activities through Michael.

The assistant found his boss's concern rather touching.

Clearly Dominic was stepping into his paternal role, so Nathan agreed without question.

"I see. I'll make arrangements," Dominic replied, his voice rough with sleep.

"There's more. Evelyn's gone viral today. Some entertainment outlet published paparazzi photos of Lily and Henry. The article claims she's a single mother with a scandalous private life..." Nathan continued his report.

Dominic's brow furrowed. "Investigate immediately. I want to know who's behind this."

"Already on it, sir. Michael said Evelyn woke at six this morning and has been distressed by the news. Given her pregnancy, her emotions are particularly fragile right now. Perhaps you could... cheer her up?"

"How exactly?"

"She's struggling with appetite. Maybe a thoughtful gift?"

Dominic massaged his temples. "Do you honestly think she'd accept anything from me?"

"Even if she refuses, she'll recognize the gesture for what it is."

The logic wasn't entirely flawed.

He'd insisted she keep the baby yet couldn't shoulder the physical burden for her.

A gift seemed the least he could offer.

Meanwhile at Mooncrest Manor, Michael broached the nanny subject with Evelyn.

"Isn't our current arrangement working fine?" Evelyn frowned. "I'm not bedridden with morning sickness. Besides, the children return to school soon."

"Don't you want to spend some of those earnings?" Michael teased. "What's the harm in hiring help?"

"It's not about money... Having a stranger in our home feels intrusive."

"We don't need live-in help. Just someone for daytime cleaning and meals."

"Fine. Bring candidates by when you've found suitable ones," Evelyn conceded, then shifted topics. "Do you have plans today?"

"None! Why?"

"Lily and Henry have extracurriculars... If you're free, take them to the science museum's aerospace exhibit. Snap some photos while you're there."

"Consider it done. We'll go during your afternoon rest," Michael promised.

By eleven that morning, Evelyn sat curled on the sofa with a novel.

Michael entertained the children with a new puzzle.

The doorbell's chime startled them all.

Through the window, Evelyn spotted the sleek black sedan parked at the gates, Dominic and Sophia standing shoulder-to-shoulder.

Michael eyed them suspiciously but opened the gates regardless.

Once inside, the visitors made straight for the living room.

Sophia clutched an oversized gift bag.

"Lily! Henry! I brought presents!" she announced, distributing brightly wrapped boxes to the eager children.

Finally, she produced an exquisite velvet case, presenting it to Evelyn. "This one's for you! Open it!"

Evelyn hesitated before lifting the lid.

The dazzling diamond necklace inside stole her breath.

Why would Sophia bring such an extravagant gift?

"Oooh! I love that necklace! Trade with me, Mommy?" Lily begged.

Sophia quickly interjected, "No! Big Brother Dominic chose that specially for Evelyn! He made me promise to deliver it!"

Both Dominic and Evelyn found themselves momentarily speechless.

###Chapter 470

Sophia was worried they didn’t grasp her meaning, so she clarified, “My brother bought this gift for Evelyn.”

Evelyn snapped the box shut, then leveled her gaze at Dominic. “What’s this supposed to mean?”

Tension crackled between them like static.

Michael wasted no time ushering Sophia and the kids out of the house.

It wasn’t healthy for children to witness their parents arguing too often.

Once outside, Sophia turned to Lily and Henry, explaining, “Dominic might have picked out Evelyn’s gift, but I was the one who chose yours! Me! You have to accept them!”

“Okay,” Lily agreed, already tearing into her present.

Henry, however, kept his eyes locked on the living room.

“Relax, kid. Your mom’s carrying that jerk’s baby—he wouldn’t dare mess with her,” Michael reassured, nudging Henry’s shoulder. “Let’s go grab some ice cream.”

“I’m not leaving,” Henry said stubbornly.

He wasn’t about to abandon his mother.

Sophia took his hand. “Come on, let’s go! My brother won’t hurt Evelyn. When he was picking her gift today, he wanted to buy the whole store for her! He adores her!”

Henry shuddered at the thought.

That bastard Dominic Blackwood knew how to love someone?

Not a chance.

Inside, Dominic settled onto the couch across from Evelyn.

He had anticipated her rejection.

That’s exactly why he’d brought Sophia along.

Evelyn might have accepted it if Sophia hadn’t blurted out the truth.

“Is this some kind of compensation for carrying your child?” Evelyn pushed the gift box toward him. “What else could it be?”

“Do I need a reason to give you a gift?”

“Why else would you?” she shot back.

“Sophia didn’t need a reason to buy presents for your kids.”

“You’re not Sophia, and I’m not a five-year-old.”

Seeing her defiance, Dominic relented.

“If your daughter likes it, give it to her.”

“Lily doesn’t take hand-me-downs,” Evelyn said coolly.

Dominic had no retort.

“Anything else?” she asked, her tone making it clear he should leave.

He glanced outside.

Michael had already herded Sophia and the kids away.

“I’ll wait here for Sophia,” he said flatly.

Evelyn blinked in disbelief.

Dominic’s behavior toward her had done a complete one-eighty.

She was used to the old him—their past dynamic had felt almost normal in its predictability.

“Did you shower Zoe with gifts the second she got pregnant too?” The words slipped out before she could stop them. “Our relationship hasn’t changed just because I’m carrying your child. This sudden kindness? It feels patronizing.”

The way he treated her now was nothing like before.

Did he think pregnancy had rewritten who she was?

She hated the idea of respect being tied to offspring.

This baby was just as much hers as his.

Even if Dominic raised it, she refused to be sidelined.

Her words made Dominic frown.

Bringing up Zoe could only mean one thing—Evelyn was still bothered by her.

In her eyes, he was tainted. That would never change.

No matter what he did, she’d never let herself care.

Dominic almost laughed at his own naivety.

He’d actually thought the baby would bring them closer.

###Chapter 471 A Cruel Delusion

Dominic's knuckles turned white as he rose from the sofa, his eyes bloodshot.

"Never come back here," Evelyn spat, her glacial stare piercing through him. "Surely you remember what you did to my son. Every time he sees you, those memories come flooding back."

Dominic's throat worked as he swallowed hard.

"You only saw me strike him. Did you ever ask what he said to provoke me?"

"Words should be answered with words, not violence!" she snapped. "There was no justification for your actions."

She was absolutely right.

He had been completely in the wrong.

"That's exactly the kind of heartless brute you are!" Dominic growled.

"Spare me the introduction," Evelyn retorted sharply. "I know exactly who you are!"

The light in Dominic's eyes dimmed as despair took hold.

He choked back the desperate explanations clawing at his throat, clinging to the last shreds of his dignity.

Snatching the gift box from the coffee table, he stormed out of the house.

Evelyn drew a shuddering breath.

Through tear-blurred vision, she watched Dominic stride down the driveway.

Her breath hitched when she saw him hurl the expensive present straight into the trash bin.

Absolute madness!

Not content with being insane himself, he had to drive everyone around him to the brink too!

The moment Dominic's car disappeared, Evelyn marched outside, jaw clenched.

The bodyguard emerged from the kitchen and hurried after her. "Miss Thorne, where are you going?"

Evelyn didn't respond.

She stopped at the gates, flung open the trash can lid, and retrieved the discarded gift box.

The bodyguard gaped in astonishment.

She could have simply ordered him to retrieve it. Why dirty her own hands?

"Thank goodness we use liners," the bodyguard offered awkwardly. "The box is still perfectly clean!"

Evelyn clutched the package tightly as she turned back toward the house.

The bodyguard trailed behind, rambling nervously. "Forgive my presumption, Miss Thorne, but Mr. Blackwood was being quite polite earlier... Perhaps you were too harsh? Since you retrieved his gift, it shows you're not completely heartless. Why put on such an icy front?"

Evelyn whirled to face him.

"An eternity wouldn't be enough to explain the history between us. You have no right to judge what you don't understand."

She lifted the box meaningfully. "As for why I retrieved this? Because I can't stand seeing beautiful things destroyed. That's exactly the kind of man he is - always ruining everything good!"

The bodyguard fell silent.

The long weekend passed in a blur.

At Blackwood Group's executive office, Lucas knocked and entered.

Approaching the desk, he deposited several books with careful precision.

"Dominic, I picked these up from the bookstore. Thought they might be helpful."

Dominic eyed the titles with disdain: "The Expectant Father's Guide," "The Complete Baby Care Manual," "Pregnancy Week by Week," "Newborn Essentials."

He shoved them into his drawer with unnecessary force.

Lucas pursed his lips. "You look miserable for someone about to become a father. Don't you want this child? Rumor has it you were desperate for this baby."

"Did those same rumors mention our fight?"

"Well... I might have heard something. Pregnant women are hormonal. Hang in there."

"She can't forgive my past with Zoe. She knows I was coerced, but the reasons don't matter - only the result," Dominic said bleakly. "Without love, there's no room for forgiveness, not even for the smallest mistake."

###Chapter 472 by Silent Echoes

Dominic settled into the leather armchair, his piercing gaze fixed on Lucas as he poured out his frustrations.

"Let's be clear - your involvement with Zoe Montgomery was never Evelyn's doing. That decision was made for Sophia's wellbeing," Lucas stated bluntly, swirling his whiskey. "Evelyn remains completely unaware of your connection to Sophia. Her reaction is perfectly understandable."

Dominic's stormy eyes flickered with emotion. "What exactly do you believe my relationship with Sophia to be?"

A knowing smile played on Lucas's lips. "Would you like me to spell it out for you?"

"I expected nothing less from you," Dominic replied, his voice laced with quiet confidence. "You've always seen through me."

"Is this really about Evelyn's lack of trust?" Lucas probed, sensing the impending storm in their relationship.

Dominic's jaw tightened. "Wouldn't that explain everything?"

Lucas stroked his clean-shaven chin thoughtfully. "Not everyone possesses your level of composure, Dominic. Love makes fools of us all. Need I remind you of your jealousy toward Michael last year? You weren't exactly the picture of rationality then."

The light in Dominic's eyes dimmed as his shoulders slumped slightly. "This entire situation is my doing."

"Don't be absurd!" Lucas interjected, noticing his friend's despondency. "Sophia is your twin sister, isn't she? I'd wager Evelyn never even considered that possibility. Without explicit confirmation from you, how could she possibly know? The heart sees what it fears most."

A shadow of pain crossed Dominic's striking features.

"Secrets are human nature, Dominic. You're not at fault, nor is Evelyn. Perhaps you're simply..." Lucas hesitated before finishing, "not meant to be. Harsh as it sounds, I question whether she's worth this torment. You've sacrificed enough already. Walking away now might spare you greater pain later."

Dominic's dark brows arched sharply. "You're suggesting I abandon her while she carries my child?"

Lucas cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Not abandon, precisely. But must you invest so much emotional capital? She's a brilliant physician - more than capable of caring for herself. Once the child is born, you could assume custody and finally close this painful chapter."

N?velDrama.Org exclusive content.

Dominic fell into contemplative silence, weighing Lucas's words.

The logic was sound.

Their continued entanglement would only breed more suffering for them both.

If Evelyn delivered their child safely, perhaps granting her freedom would be the merciful choice.

Meanwhile, at the Oceanview Grand Hotel...

Evelyn slipped discreetly into the business symposium at 10:32 AM, her bodyguard maintaining a protective distance.

Margaret Thorne sat prominently on the panel, sharing entrepreneurial insights with other business leaders.

Evelyn removed her oversized sunglasses, her emerald eyes hardening as they locked onto Margaret.

The previous evening's discovery still burned fresh - Michael had traced the leaked children's photos to a purchased corporate account.

The culprit? Margaret's personal assistant.

The assistant's actions were Margaret's by proxy.

No underling would orchestrate such an expensive smear campaign without explicit orders.

As the Q&A session commenced, Evelyn's hand shot up with deliberate precision.

The moderator gestured toward her. "Yes, the lady in the third row?"

"May I pose my question directly on stage?" Evelyn's clear voice carried across the auditorium.

A beat of hesitation. "Certainly!"

Every eye in the venue followed her graceful movement toward the stage - including Margaret's widening ones.

The color drained from Margaret's carefully made-up face at the unexpected confrontation.

Evelyn's bodyguard exhaled sharply. He hadn't anticipated this level of boldness from his charge.

###Chapter 473 The bodyguard sensed the situation spiraling out of control.

His fingers flew across the phone screen as he sent their coordinates to Michael Sterling with a frantic message.

[Evelyn Thorne confronting Margaret Thorne at Oceanview Grand! Get here NOW!]

When Michael saw the hotel location flashing on his screen, his blood ran cold.

Just this morning, Evelyn had been vomiting after barely touching her breakfast. She could hardly stand without swaying.

How in God's name had she managed to confront Margaret Thorne?!

Michael snatched his car keys, nearly knocking over his coffee as he bolted from his office.

Back at the hotel, Evelyn strode onto the stage with deliberate calm.

She took the microphone from the startled host and turned to face Margaret.

"I have one question for you, Mrs. Thorne," her voice rang clear through the speakers. "Is your assistant's name Fiona Montgomery?"

Margaret's eyes turned glacial. "That's irrelevant to today's discussion."

"Aren't we discussing ethical business practices?" Evelyn countered, producing several documents from her bag.

The large projection screen captured every movement, broadcasting the confrontation to the entire audience.

"On Harvest Festival night, your assistant bribed a media outlet to publish defamatory articles about me. She then repeatedly contacted social media teams to keep the story trending..." Evelyn's voice grew stronger. "You spent approximately seventy-five thousand dollars. Did you expense these transactions?"

Margaret's face contorted with rage as the evidence became visible to all.

"Since you have no shame, I'll expose you publicly!" Evelyn declared, flinging the papers at Margaret. "The police already have copies! Expect your subpoena soon!"

Margaret's bodyguard lunged forward, seizing Evelyn's arm and dragging her offstage.

Chaos erupted throughout the venue.

Evelyn's bodyguard charged forward, roaring, "Release her! Damn it, she's—"

He barely stopped himself from revealing her pregnancy, remembering it wasn't his place to disclose.

"Let me go!" Evelyn cried out in pain as two bodyguards now restrained her.

Her bodyguard managed to wrestle one away, but the other shoved Evelyn violently. "She started this! Don't blame me for defending my client! Get out!"

Evelyn stumbled backward, hitting the floor with a sickening thud.

Her head struck the ground, but her arms instinctively cradled her abdomen.

"Miss Thorne!" Her bodyguard's voice shook with panic. Without hesitation, he scooped her up. "Hospital! Now!"

As he carried her out, Evelyn's phone began ringing incessantly in her purse.

Meanwhile, Michael sat trapped in gridlocked traffic, pounding his steering wheel.

His Bluetooth earpiece connected as he tried calling Evelyn repeatedly—no answer.

The bodyguard's phone likewise went straight to voicemail.

Michael's knuckles turned white on the wheel.

He dialed Nathan Cross, who answered immediately.

"Evelyn's lost her damn mind! She could barely keep water down this morning, and now she's confronting Margaret Thorne!" Michael growled. "I can't reach her or her bodyguard, and this fucking traffic won't move!"

"Where is she?" Nathan's calm voice contrasted sharply with Michael's panic.

"Sending location now!"

Michael hung up and forwarded the hotel details.

Thirty minutes later, Dominic Blackwood's phone rang with Nathan's call.

Nathan carefully omitted that Evelyn had been hospitalized after being thrown to the ground.

He simply stated she was at St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

"Don't trouble yourself, sir. Michael and I have it handled," Nathan said.

Dominic slammed his laptop shut and stormed from his office. "Handled? Then explain what the hell happened!" His voice cut like ice.

###Chapter 474

Nathan could no longer conceal the truth from Dominic. His voice trembled as he spoke. "Evelyn went to see Margaret Thorne today. One of the bodyguards pushed her... she fell."

That morning, Nathan had informed Dominic about Margaret's assistant being behind the viral scandal days earlier.

Dominic had planned to confront Margaret himself.

He never expected Evelyn to beat him to it.

The heavy breathing on the other end of the line made Nathan's stomach twist with anxiety.

"It was an accident, sir. Please don't blame Evelyn... She's devastated. She'd never risk the baby's safety... She's in terrible shape right now. When you see her—"

The call disconnected abruptly.

Ever since Nathan started dating Michael Sterling, his loyalties had become questionable.

Dominic cared about the unborn child, but that didn't mean Evelyn's wellbeing meant any less to him.

If forced to choose between them, Evelyn would always come first.

At Marvel Tech, Zoe Montgomery rushed to Margaret's office the moment she heard about the altercation.

"Is this your brilliant plan, Margaret?" Zoe's suppressed rage finally erupted. "Exposing her children was your only move?"

Margaret gave her a cold glance. "Do you understand how a CEO's personal life affects their company? The children were just the beginning. Destroying her reputation was the goal."

"Since when is having children out of wedlock a scandal? What century are you living in?" Zoe's face twisted in disbelief.

"Our primary customer base is over forty—"

"I don't care about your market analysis! Those are Dominic Blackwood's children! Do you really think he'll stand by while you attack Evelyn?"

Margaret's expression faltered. "I suspected as much. The boy looks just like him. When Dominic discovers the truth, he'll fight for custody. That's exactly why Evelyn's been terrified of him finding out!"

Zoe pressed her fingers to her temples, praying she was overreacting.

"Evelyn's right-hand man, Michael Sterling, is a tech genius," Margaret hissed. "He ruined everything. Now he has leverage against me. We can't use this strategy again."

Margaret's phone rang.

A panicked voice screamed through the receiver. "Madam Thorne! Help me! Please!"

The line went dead.

"What happened?" Zoe demanded.

Margaret's ashen face made Zoe's blood run cold.

"It's my bodyguard... Something's wrong."

They rushed toward the elevator.

The doors slid open to reveal a bloodied man crawling toward them.

Zoe screamed.

Margaret's face drained of color.

Her bodyguard.

Beaten beyond recognition.

"This was Evelyn Thorne! She did this!" Margaret spat through clenched teeth.

Her phone rang again.

Sweat dripped down her spine as she stared at the unknown number.

Her hands shook as she answered.

"Listen carefully, Madam Thorne," a menacing voice growled. "Tell your assistant to watch her back."

Margaret's jaw tightened. She knew Evelyn was behind this brutality.

"I'm calling the police! You'll pay for this!"

"Go ahead. If you're ready to face Dominic Blackwood's wrath." The caller chuckled darkly.

Margaret's face flushed crimson.

Dominic Blackwood?

###Chapter 475 It Was Dominic Blackwood?!

At St. Elizabeth Medical Center, Michael Sterling was keeping Evelyn Thorne company in the private ward.

Nathan Cross stood guard outside, waiting for Dominic's arrival.

When Dominic appeared, Nathan quickly composed himself. "Sir, the doctors insist Ms. Thorne requires complete bed rest for at least a week. They've advised against any emotional distress, so—"

"Are you attempting to stop me?" Dominic's icy glare cut through Nathan like winter wind.

Nathan immediately stepped aside, opening the door without another word.

Upon entering, Dominic found Michael standing protectively near Evelyn's bedside. Nathan shot Michael a pointed look, but the younger man squared his shoulders.

"The pregnancy... it's over," Michael announced bluntly.

A flicker of something unreadable passed through Dominic's stormy eyes.

"Leave us. I need to speak with Evelyn alone," Dominic commanded, his voice rough with restrained emotion.

Evelyn, who had been staring blankly at the ceiling, turned her head slightly at his voice.

Nathan seized Michael's arm and practically dragged him from the room.

The door clicked shut, leaving Dominic and Evelyn in heavy silence.

Dominic approached the bed slowly, taking Evelyn's IV-tethered hand in his. His touch was unexpectedly gentle. "Evelyn, losing the baby... it's not the end. Don't torment yourself over this."

His words hung between them, so utterly wrong that Evelyn couldn't find her voice.

She studied his devastatingly handsome face—the sharp jawline, those piercing eyes—and wondered if this was some cruel hallucination.

How could he possibly be relieved about her miscarriage?

"Your health comes first now. Focus on recovering," Dominic continued, his thumb brushing lightly over her knuckles.

The tenderness in his voice made Evelyn's stomach twist. She watched as his gaze traced the pallor of her face, the dark circles beneath her eyes.

Whether she'd wanted this pregnancy or not, the physical toll was undeniable. Dominic's expression suggested he understood this all too well.

"Recover my health..." Evelyn echoed faintly, her brow furrowing. "And then what?"

Dominic's grip tightened almost imperceptibly. He recognized the fear behind her question—the unspoken dread that he'd view her as nothing more than a vessel for his heir.

"You were never my enemy, Evelyn."

Seeing her fragile state, Dominic chose his next words carefully. "I won't force another pregnancy on you."

The knot in Evelyn's chest loosened slightly, but suspicion lingered. "You don't think I... fell on purpose?"

Dominic's eyes widened briefly before narrowing. "Apparently you've upgraded me from monster to complete psychopath in your estimation."

Against all odds, Evelyn felt the ghost of a smile tug at her lips.

Dominic's expression turned stern. "No more reckless stunts, Evelyn. Crashing conferences, confronting enemies on stage—this isn't how we handle things."

Indignation flared in Evelyn's chest. "Says the man who solves every problem with his fists. My recklessness pales in comparison to your methods."

"Still sharp-tongued, I see," Dominic muttered, reaching for the food container on the bedside table. He lifted the lid, revealing still-steaming soup. "You should eat. It's warm."

"I can't. I'll vomit."

Dominic frowned. "You're still nauseous? That doesn't make sense if..." His voice trailed off as realization dawned.

"The doctor never confirmed a miscarriage," Evelyn said flatly, watching his reaction closely.

Michael had lied. She'd allowed the deception, curious to see how Dominic would respond.

Dominic's fingers tightened around the soup bowl. Rather than relief, dark anger clouded his features at being manipulated.

He stood abruptly, chair scraping against the floor.

"Michael wasn't entirely wrong," Evelyn called after him as he strode toward the door. "The baby's condition is precarious. Bed rest is mandatory. There's no guarantee it will survive the week."

Dominic froze mid-step, his entire body going rigid. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

###Chapter 476 Evelyn's chest tightened as she watched Dominic's stiffened shoulders retreat from her.

"Regardless of what happens with this pregnancy, I need you to remain composed. Miscarriages happen naturally in many pregnancies. Not every conception results in a successful birth."

She spoke these words with a heavy heart, her intuition screaming warnings she couldn't ignore.

Ever since discovering her pregnancy at 25 weeks during medical treatment, she'd been consumed by dark premonitions.

Only sheer luck had sustained this child against all odds.

And anything gained through luck could just as easily be lost.

Dominic recoiled as if physically struck by her words.

Whirling around, his stormy gaze locked onto hers. "Is this your idea of comfort? Look at yourself - who's truly struggling to stay calm here? You tested me earlier. Since you never wanted this child to begin with, let's just pretend it's already gone."

The door slammed behind him with finality.

Moments later, Michael entered, eyebrows raised. "That was quick. What did you say to him? He looked ready to murder someone. Does he actually believe the baby's lost?"

Evelyn stared blankly at the hospital wall, her thoughts scattered like leaves in a storm.

"Michael... He's not... entirely terrible to me... is he?"

Michael crossed his arms, exhaling sharply. "Don't tell me you're falling for him again?"

Her lashes fluttered downward. "When you told him about the baby... he said I should focus on recovering. That he wouldn't force another pregnancy on me."

"One minute he's your worst nightmare, the next you're making him out to be some saint. Evelyn, I'm seriously concerned you've developed Stockholm syndrome."

Her icy glare could have frozen lava.

"What? I'm just saying - no matter how nice he acts, keep your guard up." He dragged a chair to her bedside. "For God's sake, Evelyn. Whatever you do next, at least clue me in! You'd be devastated losing this baby, yet you charged into Margaret's den like some avenging angel? She wants you dead as much as you want her buried!"

Evelyn acknowledged her recklessness now.

Confronting Margaret had been a heat-of-the-moment decision.

The injustice had simply been too much to bear.

"I should have listened to you," she admitted.

"Damn right you should have! Everything I do is for your protection!"

"I meant I should've hired more bodyguards. If I'd arrived with twice her security detail, she'd be the one in this hospital bed," Evelyn countered dryly.

Michael threw his hands up in exasperation.

Thirty minutes later, the door swung open to reveal Margaret and her trembling assistant, Fiona Montgomery.

Fiona collapsed dramatically at Evelyn's bedside.

"Forgive me, Miss Thorne! This was all my doing! I'm despicable! I deserve to die!" Her palms cracked against her cheeks in theatrical repentance.

The sharp slaps echoed through the sterile room.

Evelyn observed coldly before shifting her attention to Margaret's carefully composed face.

"Let me guess your strategy. If this goes to court, you'll pay a trivial fine. Pocket change for someone like you." Her eyes narrowed. "Who sent you here?"

Margaret's smile didn't reach her calculating eyes. "Playing innocent? Dominic Blackwood still dances to your tune even after your split. What spell did you cast on him?"

"Interesting. Then why aren't you kneeling too?" Evelyn's voice turned razor-sharp. "No amount of your assistant's self-flagellation changes who orchestrated this!"

Dominic hadn't ordered this apology.

He'd specifically instructed that Evelyn needed undisturbed rest during her critical recovery.

Margaret had come of her own volition, fearing for Fiona's safety.

She never anticipated Evelyn's ruthless countermove.

Jaw clenched, Margaret slowly lowered herself to her knees.

Silently, she vowed to repay this humiliation tenfold.

As Evelyn watched her stepmother kneel, a dark satisfaction uncoiled in her chest.

###Chapter 477

Margaret Thorne was a woman consumed by pride, and Evelyn Thorne was the object of her deepest contempt.

Kneeling before Evelyn must have been absolute torture for her!

When the nurse entered the room moments later, she froze at the sight of the two women on their knees before the hospital bed.

"Take your things and get out!" Michael Sterling bellowed, hurling the fruit basket they'd brought across the room.

Silence settled over the hospital room once Margaret and Fiona had been dismissed.

After the nurse adjusted Evelyn's IV, Michael flashed his phone with a mischievous grin.

"Nathan said the bodyguards who pushed you this morning have been dealt with," he announced, clearly pleased. "I'm not Dominic Blackwood's biggest admirer, but I'll give him credit where it's due."

"Dealt with... how?"

Michael covered his mouth, feigning guilt. "Nathan told me not to say anything... He was worried it might frighten you."

Evelyn remained silent.

"Did you really think Margaret would come here and apologize on her own?" Michael teased. "She's terrified! I didn’t expect you to use Dominic’s name like that earlier."

Evelyn’s cheeks flushed. "He was the one who insisted on playing the hero. Why waste the opportunity?"

"Fair point," Michael chuckled. "Treat him like a stray puppy—play with him when you're in the mood, ignore him when you're not."

Absently, Evelyn checked the time on her phone.

"I'm going to rest. We’ll leave when I wake up."

"Got it. Sleep well. I’ll step out for a smoke."

Michael helped her settle back against the pillows before slipping out of the room.

The moment Margaret collapsed into her car, tears spilled down her face in furious, unchecked streams.

Fiona hesitantly offered a tissue. "I'm so sorry, Madam Thorne. This is all my fault."

Margaret swatted the napkin away, wiping her face with her hands instead.

"This has nothing to do with you," she hissed. "I’m just not powerful enough yet. But mark my words—once I surpass Dominic Blackwood, no one will dare humiliate me like this again!"

She snatched her phone from her bag and dialed Zoe Montgomery.

The call connected instantly.

"I need you to do something for me, Zoe."

"Not if it’s dangerous!" Zoe shot back.

"I think Evelyn Thorne is pregnant," Margaret said coldly. "My bodyguard barely touched her, and yet she ended up hospitalized. She’s in the maternity ward."

Zoe went still. "You want me to confirm whether she’s pregnant?"

"Exactly. And if she is, I’d bet anything it’s Dominic’s. Why else would he defend her so fiercely?"

Zoe’s heart shattered.

She had longed for Dominic’s child, yet he had never so much as glanced her way.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had already given him twins—and now, possibly another baby on the way.

Dominic had given Evelyn everything.

By four that afternoon, Zoe arrived at St. Elizabeth Medical Center.

It didn’t take long to uncover Evelyn’s condition.

She called Margaret back, her voice tight. "Evelyn is pregnant. But after today’s fall, she might not be able to keep it."

A chill slithered down Margaret’s spine.

"No wonder Dominic was so furious."

A slow, cruel smile curved her lips. "Let’s hope she loses it. Wouldn’t that be poetic?"

A week later, Evelyn returned to the hospital for a checkup—to see if the baby had survived.

###Chapter 478

Evelyn strode confidently into St. Elizabeth Medical Center, heading straight for the maternity ward.

Michael grabbed her arm at the last moment, steering her toward the ultrasound department instead.

She arched an eyebrow in silent question.

"I think...we should get an ultrasound first," Michael said, his attempt at casualness failing miserably.

Finally, he admitted, "Dominic's here. Waiting for you in the ultrasound room."

Evelyn jerked her arm free. "Since when did you become his informant?" she snapped.

Michael raised his hands defensively. "I'm not! Nathan told me!"

"Who works for Dominic. What's the difference?" Evelyn countered sharply.

"Of course there's a difference!" Michael insisted, grabbing her arm again. "Nathan isn't like that bastard! He promised me he'd quit if Dominic ever mistreats you again!"

"You still shouldn't be reporting my every move!"

"I didn't tell them everything," Michael protested. "I didn't mention your improved appetite lately, or how your morning sickness has nearly disappeared, or your suspicion that..." He trailed off, then added softly, "It's such a shame if the baby's really gone. Are you scheduling the procedure today?"

Evelyn's voice thickened with emotion. "If there's no heartbeat...then yes."

Her early pregnancy symptoms had diminished dramatically in recent days.

Instead of relief, she felt only dread - it likely meant she'd lost the baby.

She'd eaten a full breakfast before coming to the hospital without a hint of nausea.

Though mentally prepared for bad news, the pain intensified with each step through the hospital doors.

And now Dominic was here.

How would he react if the baby was truly gone?

Copyright by N?v/elDrama.Org.

The elevator doors opened on the ultrasound floor.

Evelyn's gaze immediately locked onto the man waiting outside the examination room.

Dominic stood there in an impeccably tailored light gray shirt and dark trousers - a stark departure from his usual all-black attire.

Her footsteps grew heavier as she approached.

Dominic watched her intently, words failing him as she drew near.

She looked well - cheeks fuller, color in her face.

Apparently her week had been comfortable.

Without a word, Evelyn brushed past him into the room, Dominic following close behind.

She lay on the table and lifted her shirt.

The cold gel made her flinch as the doctor began the examination.

With Dominic standing beside her, Evelyn closed her eyes, bracing for the verdict.

"Well, Miss Thorne," the doctor finally said, "are you experiencing any other symptoms?"

Evelyn opened her eyes. "My appetite's improved significantly."

The doctor smiled. "That's excellent. Any bleeding or spotting?"

"None."

"Good news then," the doctor said, wiping the gel away. "Your baby appears perfectly healthy. You may continue resting at home and return when you reach twelve weeks."

Evelyn froze.

The baby was fine?

Her symptoms had simply...subsided early?

Dominic helped her sit up, his voice low. "You thought you'd lost it, didn't you?"

Heat flooded Evelyn's cheeks at being so transparent.

They exited together to find Michael waiting anxiously.

"Don't be upset, Evelyn," he said consolingly. "Your health matters most!" He brandished a form. "I've already scheduled the procedure with the best specialist!"

Evelyn gaped wordlessly.

Dominic snatched the paper, tore it to shreds, and flung it in the trash. Michael's blue eyes blazed with fury.

###Chapter 479

"The baby's perfectly fine, Michael," Evelyn said, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

"Are you sure?"

Evelyn grabbed Michael's arm and steered him toward the elevator.

"Let's go to the office now!"

"But is the baby really okay?" Michael asked, his voice laced with skepticism. "Did the doctor clear you to return to work?"

"Yes, everything's fine."

The baby was safe, and her condition had improved. There was no reason she couldn't work.

Nathan stood beside Dominic, a small smile playing on his lips. "Congratulations, sir! The baby will be three months soon. Once it reaches that stage, the risk of miscarriage drops significantly."

Dominic's emotions were in turmoil.

Last night, he'd had a nightmare—one where the baby was gone.

Thankfully, it had only been a dream.

When Evelyn arrived at Thornfield Industries, the vice president immediately approached her with updates.

Despite her absence, she had stayed informed through regular emails from each department head.

As the vice president spoke, Evelyn picked up a magazine from the table.

It was the latest issue of Vogue Forward, the magazine that had interviewed her recently.

Evelyn's face graced the cover.

Originally, they had wanted her to come in for a photoshoot, but due to her illness, she had sent them a few personal photos instead.

The one they chose was a candid shot from her graduate school days—her holding a coffee cup, radiant under the sunlight.

She flipped open the magazine to the interview section.

Along with the Q&A, there was a glowing personal profile about her.

Evelyn's cheeks warmed, and she quickly closed it.

"We purchased five thousand copies, Miss Thorne," the vice president said, noticing her interest.

Evelyn froze.

"Didn't Michael tell you?" The vice president chuckled. "He insisted we distribute them to all staff and send one to each of our major clients."

A dull ache formed at her temples.

"Why wasn't I informed?!"

This was beyond excessive!

People might think she was trying to become a celebrity!

"Michael paid for them out of his own pocket, not company funds," the vice president explained. "That's why I didn’t mention it."

"Just give them to the staff. Don’t send them to clients!"

The vice president winced. "They were already couriered out this morning…"

Evelyn took a sip of water, trying to steady herself.

"All of them? Every single client?"

"I believe so. We used the sales department's list—only the top-tier ones."

"Show me the list…"

The vice president hesitated, then guessed, "Were you checking if Blackwood Group was on it, Miss Thorne? They're our most important client, so I had my assistant personally deliver a copy to them."

Evelyn buried her face in her hands.

At eleven that morning, the latest issue of Vogue Forward landed on Dominic's desk at Blackwood Group.

When he returned from his meeting, his gaze immediately locked onto the magazine before he even sat down.

There was no missing Evelyn's face on the cover.

He picked it up, scanning the headline of the interview.

"Exclusive with Evelyn Thorne: My Dream Man is Eric Montclair"

A cold fury washed over Dominic's expression.

With a sharp thud, he slammed the magazine onto his desk.

###Chapter 480

Dominic stood frozen for a heartbeat before pressing the intercom. "Nathan, get in here."

A moment later, his assistant appeared at the door.

"Who sent this magazine?" Dominic demanded, his voice sharp as ice.

Nathan hesitated. "Thornfield Industries delivered twenty copies. I instructed the secretaries to distribute them to department heads."

"Have you read it?" Dominic's jaw tightened.

"Not yet. I planned to buy one after work."

"Take mine."

Nathan stepped forward cautiously, sensing the storm brewing in his boss's expression.

The cover photo of Evelyn was breathtaking—that wasn't the issue.

It had to be the interview.

"Should I take it now, sir?"

"Get it out of my sight." Dominic's voice was dangerously quiet.

Nathan grabbed the magazine and retreated.

As soon as he was back in his office, he flipped to Evelyn's interview.

His stomach dropped.

Evelyn Thorne's Dream Man? Eric Montclair.

Nathan immediately dialed Michael Sterling.

"Margaret Thorne's been pushing the 'boss babe' narrative hard," Michael explained. "Evelyn agreed to the interview for company exposure. What's the problem?"

"You seriously used Eric Montclair for hype?" Nathan hissed.

"Wasn't our call. The magazine needed sales. Besides, Eric called Evelyn his goddess first."

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose. "Dominic just saw this. He's livid. Why the hell did you send copies to us?"

Michael chuckled. "That was the VP's idea. We sent them to major clients—though honestly, we don’t need to impress you."

Nathan hung up, exhaling sharply. He grabbed the magazine and knocked on Dominic's door again.

"Sir, I spoke with Michael. The interview was a counter to Margaret's PR. The magazine exaggerated for entertainment. Thornfield needed the buzz."

Dominic was silent for a long moment.

Then, stiffly: "Give it back."

Nathan handed it over, hiding a smirk.

Dominic flipped to the interview, scanning the text.

When asked if Eric was her ideal man, Evelyn had answered: "I suppose so. I admire him greatly."

Simple. Direct. Impossible to twist.

Dominic's shoulders relaxed slightly. His gaze lingered on Evelyn's photo—a candid shot taken abroad.

Sunlight haloed her like a crown.

Her smile was radiant, her eyes sparkling with quiet mischief.

His pulse kicked up.

At noon, Margaret returned home to find Zoe waiting.

"Evelyn's baby is fine," Zoe announced bitterly.

Margaret scoffed. "When she went back to work, I assumed she'd lost it."

"We have to get rid of that child," Zoe snapped. "Once it's born, Dominic will raise it. He'll keep protecting her until then."

Margaret's nails dug into her palms. "Why does he care so much about his ex-wife? Evelyn would sell her soul for money. Carrying some man's bastard—her father would've died of shame!"

Zoe flinched. The words hit too close to home.

After all, she’d do the same for Dominic in a heartbeat.

And she wasn’t the only one.

###Chapter 481 by Silent Echo

"Don't even dream of harming her if you can't prevent that pregnancy!" Zoe Montgomery hissed, deliberately provoking Margaret Thorne. "And you can kiss my investment goodbye if you fail!"

Margaret's eyes gleamed with sudden interest. "How much more can you squeeze from Dominic Blackwood?"

Zoe lifted her chin confidently. "At least another hundred fifty-five million."

"Consider it done!" Margaret declared. "That child will never take its first breath!"

When Evelyn Thorne returned home that evening, an unfamiliar car sat parked at the Mooncrest Manor gates. Were they expecting visitors?

She parked her vehicle and stepped out.

Her two children and Sophia Blackwood emerged together from the grand entrance.

"Mommy!" Lily squealed.

Michael Sterling scooped up the excited girl as she rushed toward Evelyn.

"Why is Sophia here?" Michael asked quietly.

Sophia approached with a gentle smile. "I'm heading home now, Evelyn!" she announced before departing.

Evelyn glanced at Lily. "When did Sophia arrive, sweetheart?"

"She was waiting at the gates when Henry and I got home from school," Lily explained, brows furrowed. "She told Henry a secret but won't share it with me."

Evelyn's gaze shifted to her son.

A secret?

What could Henry and Sophia possibly share?

"Didn't you say you were starving, Evelyn? Let's eat!" Michael interjected, carrying Lily inside.

Henry kept his secret, and Evelyn respected his privacy by not pressing further.

The next day, the National Youth Coding Olympiad finals commenced at the city's Science Hall.

Over sixty child prodigies competed for the top honor.

Sophia sat in the audience, her unwavering focus fixed on Henry.

She'd convinced him to participate after learning the champion would gain direct admission to the nation's elite university program for gifted youths.

After ninety intense minutes, the judges awarded Henry a perfect score unanimously.

When the announcer declared "Henry Thorne - Champion!" Sophia's heart raced with exhilaration.

During the award ceremony, she rushed onstage with a vibrant bouquet.

"Henry! I knew you'd win!" she exclaimed, lifting him in an exuberant spin.

"Put me down!" Henry protested, discomfort flashing across his face.

Sophia released him and turned to the host. "May we leave? We have celebrating to do!"

Several older competitors who'd placed behind Henry exchanged dark looks.

"Isn't that the crazy woman Dominic Blackwood spent millions searching for last year?" one boy sneered.

"No wonder Henry Thorne skipped straight to finals and won!" another jeered. "Blackwood connections at work!"

The crowd's mocking stares and cruel whispers made Henry's body tense with pain.

He hadn't used Dominic's influence!

With burning eyes, he hurled his trophy across the room.

###Chapter 482

At Blackwood Group headquarters, Dominic answered his ringing phone.

"Mr. Blackwood, Miss Sophia brought Henry Thorne to compete in the finals of the National Youth Coding Olympiad today," reported the bodyguard on the line.

Dominic's brows knitted together in confusion. "What did you just say?"

The bodyguard repeated the information, then added, "Miss Sophia specifically asked me not to inform you about this."

"Then why are you telling me now?"

Dominic rubbed his temples as a wave of unease washed over him.

"When Henry won the competition, Miss Sophia rushed onto the stage. Someone recognized her, and chaos broke out. She's unharmed but visibly shaken."

The bizarre story sounded almost fabricated to Dominic.

Why would Sophia take Henry to a coding competition?

Henry was a solitary child who avoided strangers. Under normal circumstances, he would never agree to participate in such an event.

How had Sophia managed to persuade him?

"Send me the address immediately," Dominic commanded before ending the call.

Meanwhile, Henry sat on a park bench near the science museum, exhausted from the day's events.

Sophia, clutching the trophy, settled beside him.

"I'm sorry, Henry," she said softly. "I only brought you here because I thought you'd enjoy meeting other kids like you in the elite class."

"Why would I need an elite class?" Henry snapped.

"My teacher said everyone there is incredibly smart. I thought you'd be happier surrounded by people like you," Sophia explained earnestly. "If there were a place where I could be with people like me, I know I'd love it."

Henry wanted to lash out, but Sophia's innocent expression disarmed him.

He didn't want to scold her, but he worried she might try something like this again.

"Just because you're my aunt doesn't mean you can interfere in my life," Henry stood abruptly. "Even family should respect boundaries!"

With that, he turned and stormed away.

Sophia hurried after him, trophy still in hand. "Don't be mad! Forget about the elite class! I promise I won't upset you again!"

What frustrated Henry most wasn't Sophia—it was Dominic.

"I hate Dominic Blackwood!"

Sophia looked perplexed but didn't know how to change Henry's opinion of his uncle.

All she could do was ensure he didn't dislike her too.

"Let's get ice cream," she suggested brightly, taking his hand. "Who cares what those people said? You're amazing just as you are! They called me crazy, but I don't care. To me, you're the smartest person ever!"

Her words slowly melted Henry's icy demeanor.

Earlier, Sophia had forced the boy who accused Henry of cheating to apologize. The terrified boy had complied reluctantly.

"Fine. Ice cream," Henry conceded, wanting to forget the day's events.

"I'll get it right now! Wait here!" Sophia dashed off, still carrying the trophy, with the bodyguard following.

Watching them leave, Henry considered fleeing. He craved solitude, but couldn't bear disappointing Sophia if she returned to find him gone.

She was nothing like Dominic.

They shouldn't be judged the same way.

A sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up outside the park.

The moment Dominic entered, his piercing gaze immediately found Henry standing near a flowerbed.

Henry looked up, meeting Dominic's eyes as if sensing the intensity of that stare.

###Chapter 483 The instant Henry's gaze collided with Dominic's, his entire body went rigid with terror!

His mother had warned him to stay miles away from this man.

Without hesitation, Henry turned on his heel and marched away.

"Henry Thorne!" Dominic's voice cut through the air like a whip when he noticed the boy deliberately avoiding him.

Henry's pace faltered slightly, but he kept moving forward.

Dominic had no choice but to jog after the stubborn child.

Planting himself firmly in Henry's path, Dominic demanded, "Why are you wandering alone? Where's Sophia?"

"Get away from me!" Henry spat, refusing to meet his eyes. "Didn't you promise me one wish? I'm cashing it in now. Stay out of my life! Never come near me again!"

A strange mixture of irritation and guilt churned in Dominic's chest as he took in Henry's conflicted expression.

This wasn't how he wanted his relationship with Evelyn's son to be!

Severing ties with Henry would inevitably damage his already fragile connection with Evelyn.

If only he hadn't lost control that day, nearly choking the life out of this boy... Evelyn wouldn't have banned him from Mooncrest Manor.

"I want to apologize," Dominic said, his Adam's apple bobbing visibly. "I'm truly sorry."

Henry blinked in shock. Was he hearing correctly?

Since when did the proud Dominic Blackwood ever admit wrongdoing?

"I don't want your stupid apology!" Henry shouted, leaving no room for reconciliation.

Swinging his backpack over his shoulder, he stormed toward the park gates.

Concerned for his safety, Dominic followed. "Let me drive you home."

"No!" Henry yelled without turning back.

In one swift motion, Dominic scooped him up. "You're going home whether you like it or not! Stop struggling! I'll leave as soon as you're safe inside."

Meanwhile at Thornfield Industries, Michael burst into Evelyn's office and urgently pulled her away from her desk.

"What's happening?" Evelyn asked, her brows knitting together.

"Big trouble!" Michael's face was grave. "If I hadn't seen the news, we wouldn't have known about Henry's secret! He participated in the National Youth Coding Olympiad! He won, but now there's controversy."

Evelyn's face paled. "What kind of trouble? Is Henry okay? Where is he now?"

"Dominic Blackwood took him home!"

"What does Dominic have to do with this?!"

"Sophia was the one who entered Henry in the competition," Michael explained as they rushed to the elevator. "She bypassed all preliminary rounds straight to finals! Other contestants are protesting the results."

Evelyn stood frozen.

"How did Sophia manage that?"

"Even scarier - she kept it from Dominic too. She's definitely not as simple-minded as we thought!" Michael said with conviction. "At her current cognitive level, she's perfectly capable of independence."

Though somewhat relieved, Evelyn pressed, "But is Henry alright?"

"He should be fine physically, but his hatred for Dominic runs deep... They're together right now... I dread to imagine that confrontation," Michael shrugged.

Cold sweat trickled down Evelyn's back.

When Henry arrived at Mooncrest Manor, he immediately barricaded himself in his room.

Dominic waited in the living room for Evelyn's return.

The silence was deafening, doing nothing to calm the storm raging in his mind.

He'd always noticed Henry bore some resemblance to him.

But today he realized it wasn't just physical - the boy's fiery temper mirrored his own!

Dominic couldn't stop the nagging thought: Did Evelyn really just adopt this temperamental child?

Was Henry truly not his son?!

###Chapter 484

Evelyn reached Mooncrest Manor approximately thirty minutes later.

She burst through the front door, still wearing her outdoor shoes as she marched straight toward Dominic.

"Where's Henry? Why are you alone here?"

Dominic opened his mouth to respond, but Evelyn cut him off when she noticed the state of his clothing.

His usually pristine dress shirt was crumpled beyond recognition. Her eyes traced the deep wrinkles down to his back where a sizable piece of fabric was missing.

Beneath the torn section, an angry red bite mark stood out against his skin. Though the bleeding had stopped, the wound looked painfully raw.

"Did Henry do this to you?" Evelyn demanded, her voice trembling slightly.

"I deserved it," Dominic replied evenly. "He's upstairs in his room."

Evelyn nodded curtly. "Stay here. I need to check on him first."

As she ascended the staircase, Michael strolled up behind Dominic, examining the injury with a low whistle. "Damn, little H really got you good! Looks like you tangled with a rabid dog!"

Dominic turned slowly, fixing Michael with an intense stare. "Michael... is Henry my son?"

Michael's expression froze for several heartbeats before he managed a forced laugh. "What kind of ridiculous question is that? You made Evelyn terminate your first child together. Henry was adopted. Do you need to see the paperwork?"

"Show me the adoption papers," Dominic said quietly.

Michael's face paled. "I-I don't have them on me. Evelyn keeps those documents. But I wouldn't bring it up if I were you. Mentioning Henry will only remind her how you nearly killed him that night!"

"I apologized to Henry today."

"And you think that fixes everything?" Michael scoffed, seizing the opportunity to test Dominic's resolve. "Even if Henry were your biological son, do you honestly believe he could ever forgive you after what you did?"

The words struck Dominic like a physical blow.

Michael was right.

Even if he was Henry's father by blood, the damage between them might be irreparable.

Just as Dominic had never forgiven his own father.

The bitter irony wasn't lost on him - he'd become the very man he'd spent his life despising.

Noticing Dominic's red-rimmed eyes and slumped shoulders, Michael cleared his throat awkwardly. "Relax, I'm just messing with you. Though Henry does hold grudges like nobody's business. Only one person could convince him to forgive you..."

"Who?" Dominic rasped.

"Evelyn, obviously," Michael said with a shrug. Then, changing tactics, he added, "Where's Sophia? I wanted to ask what possessed her to sneak Henry into that massive coding competition. Thank God he won - imagine the humiliation otherwise."

"I had security escort her home."

"You should have a serious talk with her. Maybe arrange for some proper schooling too."

Their conversation halted as Evelyn descended the stairs, carrying a first aid kit and a fresh shirt.

"Michael, go keep Henry company," she instructed.

"I'll take him out for ice cream instead!" Michael moved toward the staircase, pausing to whisper in Evelyn's ear, "Dominic suspects Henry is his."

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

Dominic sat motionless on the sofa, his dark eyes burning into her with unsettling intensity.

Steeling herself, Evelyn approached him. "Let me tend to that wound," she said, her voice carefully neutral.

Without protest, Dominic began unbuttoning his ruined shirt, revealing his sculpted torso. Evelyn averted her gaze, focusing on preparing the antiseptic and antibiotic ointment.

"Can I ask you something?" Dominic's sudden question made her hands falter.

"Don't distract me while I'm cleaning this," she warned. "Unless you want me to make it worse."

She dreaded the question she knew was coming.

If Dominic investigated further, the truth about Henry's parentage would be impossible to hide.

Her threat proved effective - Dominic remained silent until she finished bandaging the wound.

###Chapter 485

Evelyn finished dressing Dominic's wound, then stepped back with an icy demeanor. "Put your shirt on."

Dominic pulled on the t-shirt she'd handed him, his dark eyes lifting to meet hers. "May I ask my question now?"

"What is it?" Her voice was frosty, her expression unreadable. "Henry doesn't like you. Stay away from him. If this happens again, just call me."

Dominic's mind went blank.

He'd truly brought this upon himself.

Gathering his torn dress shirt, he rose to leave.

Evelyn suddenly felt a pang of unease.

Her feet moved of their own accord as she called out, "What did you want to ask me?"

Turning back, Dominic studied her face before speaking. "Do you think Sophia should continue treatment? I'm concerned about the toll it's taking on her health."

"Isn't Zoe Montgomery Sophia's physician?" The moment Evelyn spoke Zoe's name, her composure cracked. "Since you chose her and paid that outrageous fee, you should follow her advice."

Dominic hadn't expected his question to strike such a nerve.

"I won't trouble you with Sophia's condition again, Evelyn," he said flatly, his Adam's apple bobbing.

Yet Evelyn caught the flicker of disappointment in his gaze.

"If you're genuinely seeking answers, show some sincerity," she challenged, holding his stare. "Keep your secrets forever! You refused to tell me when I wanted to know. By the time you're ready to talk, I won't care to listen."

Dominic's fingers tightened around the ruined fabric. Without another word, he left in silence.

Evelyn no longer cared about his connection to Sophia.

He'd been a fool!

His pride had led him to make one mistake after another.

That damned pride had made him hide the truth from her!

Now, his pride meant nothing to her.

As the door closed, Evelyn collapsed onto the sofa.

She pressed cool palms to her flushed cheeks, each breath sharp with pain.

Michael and Henry had witnessed everything from the staircase.

It hadn't been a true argument.

Dominic hadn't fought back.

Not once since learning of her pregnancy had he stepped out of line.

This was Evelyn lashing out.

Yet with every blow she aimed at Dominic, she wounded herself too.

Henry approached, wrapping small arms around his mother.

"I'm alright, sweetheart," Evelyn murmured, returning the embrace. "Next competition, tell me beforehand? I want to be there for you."

Henry nodded solemnly.

As the Rolls-Royce left Mooncrest Manor, Dominic didn't head home.

His thoughts churned violently.

Evelyn and Henry's voices echoed in his skull until they merged into one unbearable cacophony.

Without conscious thought, he found himself at St. Elizabeth Medical Center - the hospital where Evelyn had terminated her pregnancy years before.

Seated across from the hospital director, he lit a cigarette. "Can you retrieve abortion records from five years ago?"

"Certainly," the director assured. "Just provide the patient's name, and I'll have the file brought up immediately."

The cigarette trembled between Dominic's fingers, ash dusting his knuckles.

Smoke wreathed his sharp features as he finally spoke the name: "Evelyn Thorne."

###Chapter 486 by Silent Echo

The doorbell of Mooncrest Manor rang sharply at seven in the morning, shattering the peaceful dawn.

Evelyn stumbled out of bed, her silk pajamas rumpled from sleep, and padded barefoot toward the entrance.

The security screen showed Sophie Mercer's familiar face, prompting Evelyn to immediately unlock the door.

Sophie had married Adrian Vaughn just weeks ago and left for an extended European honeymoon.

She'd specifically mentioned taking a full month's vacation across the Mediterranean.

Why was she back after barely fifteen days?

"You look exhausted, Evelyn," Sophie remarked as she breezed in, arms laden with designer shopping bags from Paris.

"I'm managing. Already back at work," Evelyn replied, eyeing the premature return. "What happened to your grand tour?"

Sophie's face darkened as she tossed her Chanel purse onto the sofa. "Absolute disaster! We were supposed to be relaxing in Santorini, but Adrian's phone never stops ringing with business calls. I swear, I'm considering annulment."

Evelyn poured them both coffee, the rich aroma filling the kitchen. "Don't be dramatic. He just took over Vanguard Holdings. Transition periods are always chaotic."

"That's no excuse!" Sophie huffed, stirring her coffee violently. "If he were more competent, he wouldn't be drowning in work constantly." She took a sip, then sighed. "Sometimes I envy how effortlessly you handle everything..."

"Effortless?" Evelyn laughed bitterly, joining her at the island. "I pull all-nighters weekly. When Michael and I launched Apex Innovations, we routinely worked until sunrise. The kids barely saw me those first two years."

Sophie's shoulders relaxed slightly at the perspective.

"Thanks for that. Adrian says I'm being unreasonable. Maybe I am... just a little."

Evelyn's cup froze midway to her lips. "He actually said that?"

"Worse." Sophie's voice cracked. "He said I contribute nothing yet constantly interrupt his work. Then he held you up as some paragon - raising twins while running a company, suggesting I learn from your example." A single tear tracked her perfectly contoured cheek.

Evelyn inhaled sharply.

Adrian had crossed a line.

"To be fair... I provoked him first," Sophie admitted, cheeks puffing. "I mentioned how Dominic Blackwood always seems available for impromptu dinners without work interruptions..."

"Appearances deceive," Evelyn countered. "Dominic has an entire wing converted to offices at Blackwood Estate. When major deals close, he disappears there for days."

Sophie's perfectly arched brows shot up. "Seriously?"

Evelyn nodded. "No one inherits success, Sophie. Even with generational wealth, sustaining it requires constant effort."

"I suppose..." Sophie glanced upstairs. "Are Lily and Henry still asleep? Don't they have school?"

As Sophie headed upstairs, Evelyn's phone vibrated with an unknown caller ID.

She hesitated for three rings before answering.

Meanwhile, Dominic Blackwood paced St. Elizabeth Medical Center's administrative office, having kept the entire records staff awake all night.

The director had repeatedly suggested Dominic return home, promising to call with any findings about Evelyn Thorne's medical history.

But Dominic refused to leave without answers.

At dawn, he personally stormed the archives - a cavernous space housing decades of patient records.

The maternity files from five years ago should have been straightforward to locate.

Yet twelve staff members combing through the system found no trace of Evelyn's records.

Under Dominic's watchful eye, they initiated a second search.

An hour later, the lead archivist approached nervously. "Mr. Blackwood, we've confirmed twice - there are no records for Miss Thorne here."

Dominic's jaw tightened, suspicion coiling in his gut.

"Perhaps you're mistaken about the hospital?" the director ventured. "If the procedure occurred here, we'd absolutely have documentation."

Dominic's head of security interjected sharply, "I personally brought her to this facility. There's no error."

The director paled. "Medical records don't simply vanish, Mr. Blackwood. The system has redundancies upon redundancies."

Dominic's phone buzzed with an incoming call as the implications settled like ice in his veins.

###Chapter 487

"Then let's track down the surgeon who performed the procedure!" the bodyguard insisted.

"Do you recall the doctor's name?" the hospital director inquired.

"How should I know? She was wearing full surgical gear—mask and cap. I barely caught a glimpse of her face!"

"Perhaps I could question all the obstetricians. Someone might remember Miss Thorne."

Dominic stormed out of the room.

He already had his answer.

Five years ago, Evelyn never went through with the abortion.

Henry Thorne was his son.

But what good did this revelation do now?

Henry would never forgive Dominic for the harm he'd caused.

Evelyn had deliberately kept the children's existence from him—she wouldn't suddenly advocate for him now.

Dominic didn't blame Evelyn.

This was entirely his own doing.

Five years ago, he'd vowed to strangle any child Evelyn bore with his bare hands.

And true to his word, he'd nearly killed his own son.

Dominic's bloodshot eyes glistened with unshed tears.

He slammed the car door, revved the engine, and sped away.

The tires screeched as he pulled up to Mooncrest Manor, parking abruptly before Evelyn's estate.

A crimson BMW caught his attention—likely Sophie Mercer's vehicle.

He jabbed the doorbell.

Within moments, Sophie appeared, holding little Lily's hand.

"Looking for Evelyn? She's not home," Sophie called from behind the gated front yard.

Dominic's gaze dropped to Lily's face.

"Isn't Lily supposed to be in school today?" His voice came out rough, strained.

Lily immediately ducked behind Sophie, peering at him with wide, fearful eyes.

"She wasn't feeling well. I kept her home."

Sophie studied Dominic closely.

Something was terribly wrong.

His demeanor, his voice—everything about him seemed altered, yet his face remained the same.

A chill ran down Sophie's spine. She wanted to examine him further but fear kept her rooted in place.

"Did you need something?" she ventured.

"Did she go to work?" he countered.

Sophie took a tentative step forward and noticed the alarming redness in his eyes.

She froze.

Dare she open the gate? Had he pulled another all-nighter?

Had something triggered another episode? Was he losing his grip again?

Her fingers tightened around Lily's small hand. "She had... errands. I'm not sure of the details."

"Where's Henry?" Dominic asked softly.

"What's going on, Dominic?" Sophie's voice trembled. "I'm calling Evelyn if you don't leave right now."

"Never mind. I was just... passing by."

His expression darkened as he turned to leave.

Three steps away, a sudden buzzing filled his ears.

Then—

Thud.

Dominic collapsed face-first onto the pavement.
###Chapter 488

Lily let out a blood-curdling scream that echoed through the quiet neighborhood. Sophie scooped the trembling child into her arms and dashed inside the house.

"Shh, sweetheart! I'm calling an ambulance right now!" She settled Lily on the sofa with shaking hands before rummaging through her purse for her phone.

The little girl's sobs came in ragged gasps.

"Is... is Daddy dead?" Lily choked out between tears. "He doesn't even know I'm his daughter yet!"

Sophie clutched the hysterical child with one arm while dialing emergency services with the other. As soon as the operator answered, she rattled off their address in a breathless voice before hanging up.

"Stay right here, Lily. I need to check on him," Sophie instructed before bolting back outside.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had received an urgent call from the vice chancellor of Metropolitan University that morning. She'd brought Henry to campus immediately after breakfast.

Yesterday, her brilliant son had shocked everyone by winning the National Youth Coding Olympiad. While not the youngest participant, he'd been the youngest finalist in the competition's history.

More astonishingly - he'd taken first place.

"While Henry bypassed standard qualification procedures, the purpose of this competition is precisely to identify exceptional talents like him," the vice chancellor explained with an approving smile. "We're prepared to make exceptions for a prodigy of Henry's caliber."

"Would you consider enrolling him in our gifted program, Ms. Thorne?"

Evelyn had studied the elite program's curriculum thoroughly. Every graduate from Metropolitan's gifted program became a leader in their field - exactly the future she envisioned for Henry.

"What do you think, sweetheart?" Evelyn always made sure to include Henry in decisions about his education.

"I'll do whatever you think is best, Mom."

"I want you to have every opportunity to thrive, Henry. This could be a wonderful chance to explore new challenges and find where you belong."

She would never impose her will on her children. Their trust meant everything to her.

"Don't feel pressured, Ms. Thorne. Henry can attend on a trial basis before making any commitments," the vice chancellor offered kindly.

"That sounds perfect. Thank you."

After leaving Henry in the vice chancellor's capable hands, Evelyn stepped onto the sunlit campus grounds. When she retrieved her phone from her bag, she found three missed calls from Sophie.

Her stomach dropped as she scrolled through the frantic messages:

[Evelyn! Dominic showed up at your house and collapsed at the gate! Lily and I are freaking out!]

[Ambulance is on its way!]

[They took him to St. Elizabeth's! I called Adrian instead of going with them!]

[What happened between you two? Call me ASAP! Lily won't stop crying!]

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she immediately called Sophie back.

"Thank God you called!" Sophie answered on the first ring. "He's stable - just severe exhaustion."

"Exhaustion?" Evelyn repeated, her grip tightening around the steering wheel as she slid into her car. "He seemed fine yesterday."

"Clearly he wasn't. The man looked like death warmed over - dark circles, bloodshot eyes, the works," Sophie described with palpable concern.

"He claimed he was just 'in the neighborhood,' but I checked the map. Your place isn't anywhere near Blackwood Group or his penthouse." A dull ache spread through Evelyn's chest as she started the engine.

"How did your meeting go?" Sophie asked, deliberately changing the subject to something lighter.

"The vice chancellor agreed to a trial period for Henry." Evelyn adjusted her Bluetooth headset before pulling out of the parking lot. "How's Lily now?"

"She finally calmed down after I explained Daddy just needed rest. Thought we'd have to peel her off him when the paramedics arrived."

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she navigated the midday traffic. Their argument yesterday had been minor - just their usual bickering. What could possibly have driven Dominic to such extremes? The question gnawed at her as she accelerated toward the hospital.
###Chapter 489

What if Sophie hadn't been there when Dominic collapsed outside Evelyn's gates? The thought sent chills down her spine.

That evening, after hours of internal debate, Evelyn finally made up her mind to visit the Blackwood estate.

"I'll drive you," Michael offered, following her out the door.

Evelyn shook her head. "I'm just going to see Sophia. I won't be long."

"Cut the crap! If it was really about Sophia, you'd just call her. She has a phone now, remember?" Michael's blunt callout made Evelyn stop pretending.

"Fine. But I'm driving myself."

"Are you insane? You're pregnant! I'm not letting you drive alone at night. Dominic would have my head if anything happened!" Michael argued.

"Here's the deal - you drive me there but stay in the car. No coming inside."

Evelyn slid into the driver's seat anyway and rolled down the window. "It's still light out. Take the kids to the park. I'll be back before dark."

As she drove off, Michael threw his hands up in frustration. That bastard Dominic might be the worst, but he was still the man Evelyn chose.

No matter how much she denied it, her body always betrayed her true feelings.

Dominic hadn't returned to the Blackwood mansion since last night.

When Mrs. Wilkins heard he'd been hospitalized, she couldn't bring herself to report the household troubles.

No one dared disturb Dominic's hospital rest.

Evelyn's unexpected arrival startled the housekeeper.

"Avery—I mean, Evelyn! You should've called ahead," Mrs. Wilkins forced a smile. "Have you eaten? I can prepare something."

"I'm fine," Evelyn said. "I came to see Sophia."

The smile vanished from Mrs. Wilkins' face.

After the bodyguard brought Sophia home last night, she'd woken screaming from nightmares. By morning, she'd developed a fever. The family doctor came, but she remained delirious, muttering nonsense.

Both Mrs. Whitaker and Mrs. Wilkins were at their wits' end.

Without Dominic's explicit orders, no one dared contact Zoe Montgomery.

Everyone knew Dominic wanted nothing to do with her.

And with each surgery costing $155 million... who would risk that without authorization?

"Is Sophia not here?" Evelyn asked, noticing the housekeeper's odd expression.

Mrs. Wilkins led Evelyn to Sophia's room. "She fell ill last night and hasn't recovered," she fretted. "The bodyguard said something triggered her during their outing. She was improving, but apparently can't handle sudden changes."

Evelyn frowned. She'd come to thank Sophia.

When Henry returned from his trial day at Metropolitan University's elite program, he'd begged to continue attending. Evelyn could see how much he loved it.

Without Sophia taking him to that coding competition, he might still be at Mooncrest Academy, living an ordinary life.

She'd never realized her son was a genius. Sophia had changed everything.

Just as Evelyn reached for the door, a bodyguard rushed upstairs. "Miss Montgomery is here! She says Mr. Blackwood sent her for Miss Sophia!"
###Chapter 490

Evelyn noticed Mrs. Wilkins exhale deeply in relief. She was glad Zoe Montgomery had arrived to check on Sophia.

"Is Master Dominic awake? Did he mention when he'd be returning?" Mrs. Wilkins inquired of the bodyguard as she approached him.

Before the guard could respond, Zoe strode in carrying a medical kit.

"Did Master Dominic request your presence, Miss Montgomery?" Zoe nodded curtly. "He'll return shortly. How's Sophia's condition?"

She moved toward the staircase, then froze mid-step. Evelyn stood on the upper landing, their gazes locking in an electric moment.

Zoe swiftly regained composure. She shot Mrs. Wilkins a pointed look before demanding icily, "Who invited Evelyn Thorne here?"

"Evelyn merely stopped by to discuss something with Sophia," Mrs. Wilkins answered uncomfortably.

"I see... I assumed she'd been formally invited!" Zoe sneered.

Ascending the stairs, she positioned herself before Evelyn with mocking superiority. "Didn't you dump Dominic ages ago, Evelyn? Rumor has it you were the one who ended things. Always acting so high and mighty, looking down on him. Who are you trying to fool? Showing up uninvited? Pathetic."

Zoe deliberately brushed past Evelyn, shoulder-checking her with calculated force.

Witnessing the exchange, Mrs. Wilkins hurried upstairs, whispering urgently to Evelyn, "Perhaps you should leave for now. I'll contact you when Sophia improves."

Evelyn's expression turned glacial, fists clenched. Every fiber screamed to depart, yet her feet remained rooted to the spot.

Would fleeing after Zoe's taunts make her appear even more ridiculous? She'd come to thank Sophia, but couldn't bring herself to leave the ailing girl.

More crucially, she doubted Zoe's ability to properly treat Sophia's symptoms.

Defying Mrs. Wilkins' suggestion, Evelyn marched toward Sophia's door, swung it open, and entered.

Zoe's head snapped up at the intrusion.

Her face contorted with rage upon recognizing Evelyn.

"Who gave you permission to enter?! Have you no shame? Get out!"

As Zoe erupted, Mrs. Wilkins seized Evelyn's arm, forcibly escorting her from the room.

"Come away now, Evelyn... Let Miss Montgomery attend to Sophia undisturbed!"

Though sympathetic to Evelyn's humiliation, Mrs. Wilkins feared prolonging Sophia's suffering. Immediate treatment took precedence.

Mrs. Wilkins guided Evelyn out as Mrs. Whitaker promptly closed the door behind them.

Evelyn stared at the sealed doorway, a wave of desolation crashing over her.

To them, Zoe was Sophia's savior.

Their actions weren't malicious - merely pragmatic. Just as she'd told Dominic yesterday.

Zoe was Sophia's primary physician.

For all matters concerning Sophia's health, they turned to Zoe.

Dominic must have endured this same bitter pill.

How cruelly ironic. Evelyn's cheeks burned as her heart constricted.

"My apologies, Evelyn. I know this wounds you, but we can't delay Sophia's treatment further," Mrs. Wilkins murmured.

Torn between loyalties, her discomfort was palpable.

"Even if Miss Montgomery succeeds tonight, Sophia may lack strength to receive visitors immediately. You should return home."

Faced with Mrs. Wilkins' earnest counsel, Evelyn's final defenses crumbled. Remaining would only compound the awkwardness.

Pursing her lips, Evelyn descended the grand staircase.

"Take care, Evelyn," Mrs. Wilkins called after her, voice thick with unease.

"Remember your condition. You shouldn't endure such indignities, but with Sophia suddenly ill and only Miss Montgomery able to help... I'm truly sorry..."

"Nothing to apologize for," Evelyn replied evenly, continuing her descent.

"My visit was impulsive. I shouldn't have come."

"Don't say that. Master Dominic would be delighted knowing you stopped by," Mrs. Wilkins insisted, accompanying her down.

"Return when Sophia recovers. I'll ensure you're properly welcomed then."
###Chapter 491

Evelyn didn't respond to Mrs. Wilkins. She shouldn't have come here. She should have listened to Michael. Sophia had her own phone.

If Evelyn wanted to thank her, a simple phone call to arrange a meeting would have sufficed.

Descending to the ground floor, Evelyn grabbed her bag from the couch.

Just then, a sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled into the driveway.

Dominic was home.

Evelyn's stomach twisted.

Had she left just one minute earlier, she wouldn't have run into him. Her emotions were already in turmoil - she desperately needed solitude to process everything.

"Master Dominic's home, Evelyn!" Mrs. Wilkins announced.

So what? Evelyn lowered her gaze and marched toward the exit, bag in hand.

Dominic had already spotted the Rover parked outside.

Her presence here surprised him.

As he stepped out of the car, his intense gaze followed her exiting the mansion.

Dominic intercepted her path near her vehicle, his heart burning despite the cool night air.

Evelyn reached him quickly. She barely glanced at him before demanding, "Move."

His body tensed. Her foul mood puzzled him.

"Did you come here for something?" Dominic rasped, struggling to maintain composure.

"I came to torture myself," Evelyn answered with bitter sarcasm.

Dominic's eyes flicked to the black Porsche beside Evelyn's car - Zoe's vehicle.

"Sophia's unwell, so I asked Zoe to examine her," he explained. "Did she upset you?"

"What if she did? She's your honored guest while I'm nothing," Evelyn spat coldly, retrieving her keys to unlock the car.

Dominic seized her arm.

"How can you say that, Evelyn? If you're nothing to me, what does that make our child?"

A sharp pang shot through Evelyn's abdomen. Her early pregnancy symptoms had faded, making it easy to forget her condition.

More importantly, she refused to acknowledge any remaining connection between them.

"Did you come to see me?" Dominic pressed when she stayed silent.

"No," Evelyn met his exhausted yet handsome face. "I came for Sophia. But since she's ill, I won't disturb her."

She slid into the driver's seat and buckled up.

Dominic remained outside, his gaze burning into her.

The raw pain in his voice was unmistakable as he said, "What do you want from me, Evelyn? I wouldn't need to beg outsiders if you'd help me."

"Why should I help you?"

Evelyn avoided his eyes, hers already reddening.

"You abandoned us because of your secret with Sophia. Even when I said I felt like an intruder, you never considered my feelings or situation. Why should I help you? You're not the only one suffering in this world. Other people's hearts can shatter too!"

Dominic saw the tears glistening in her eyes. It felt like daggers piercing his chest. "Evelyn, Sophia is my—"

He decided to confess the truth.

Evelyn suddenly looked up, her voice icy. "Stop. Don't tell me. I don't want to hear it!"

Tears finally spilled down her cheeks.

Taking a shuddering breath, she started the engine and sped into the night.

Dominic remained rooted in place, tilting his head back in anguished torment.
###Chapter 492

"Let's go inside, Master Dominic." Mrs. Wilkins approached Dominic after waiting patiently.

She didn't know what conversation had transpired between him and Evelyn, but one thing was certain - he never wished any harm upon Evelyn.

Especially now that she carried his child.

Zoe had crossed the line tonight, though her actions were somewhat understandable.

If she hadn't lost her baby, she would have been a mother by now.

Dominic clenched his fists tightly before stepping into the living room.

Zoe sat sipping tea on the sofa, setting her cup down as he entered.

"Dominic, I gave Sophia a sedative. She hasn't slept in twenty-four hours and needs proper rest," she explained, watching him carefully.

"She'll need a cranial examination at the hospital tomorrow," Dominic replied tersely.

"I heard you collapsed earlier. Are you alright?" Zoe asked with genuine concern. "Your health comes first - not just for yourself, but for Sophia too. She hasn't fully recovered yet and might need another surgery."

Dominic glanced at her briefly before saying, "You may leave now."

"Of course. Sophia's asleep. You should rest too." Zoe stood gracefully, walked past him, and exited calmly.

Once alone, Dominic moved toward Sophia's room.

Seeing his approach, Mrs. Whitaker spoke softly, "She just fell asleep, Master Dominic."

"Get some rest yourself. Thank you for everything," Dominic said.

"It's nothing compared to wishing for Sophia's quick recovery," Mrs. Whitaker replied, then added gently, "You must take care of yourself too. I heard Miss Thorne is expecting your child. Wonderful news. Your mother would have been overjoyed."

A lump formed in Dominic's throat as shadows crossed his eyes.

After Mrs. Whitaker left, he sat by the bed, watching Sophia with tender eyes.

Though siblings, they bore no resemblance.

Sophia took after their father, while Dominic favored their mother.

Human nature was complex indeed.

While Dominic despised his father intensely, Sophia's resemblance never reminded him of the man.

With both parents gone and little connection to his much older brother Gregory, Sophia remained his closest family.

He couldn't bear losing her.

When Sophia awoke the next morning, she found her brother sleeping awkwardly by her bedside.

She reached out, gently shaking his shoulder. "Why are you sleeping here, big brother?"

Dominic stirred, rubbing his stiff neck. "How do you feel, Sophia?"

She blinked sleepily. "I'm fine! Just... really hungry!"

Relief washed over Dominic.

"I'll have breakfast brought up. After you eat, we're going to the hospital for a checkup."

Sophia grew quiet for a moment, recalling yesterday's events.

"Don't worry, Sophia. You'll get better soon."

"Okay."

After breakfast, Dominic escorted Sophia to St. Elizabeth Medical Center. The brain scan results came back surprisingly normal.

The doctor reviewed the images. "Sophia must avoid any stressful triggers moving forward. Maintaining her current condition is already significant progress."

The tension in Dominic's chest finally eased.

As they exited the hospital, Dominic's phone rang.

Zoe's name flashed on the screen. After helping Sophia into the car, he stepped aside to answer the call.
###Chapter 493

"Dominic, did you already take Sophia to her medical appointment? We were supposed to go together." Zoe Montgomery's voice trembled with barely concealed frustration as she stood outside the Blackwood mansion, having just been informed by Mrs. Wilkins that Dominic had left hours earlier with his sister.

Dominic's gaze swept across the crowded hospital entrance before responding in a measured tone. "The results came back stable."

"That's... good news." Zoe forced enthusiasm into her voice. "I've been drafting a third treatment protocol for Sophia. With this new approach, we could potentially schedule another surgery before winter."

"Can you guarantee this procedure would fully restore her cognitive functions?" Dominic's question cut through the phone line like ice.

Zoe's breath hitched. No reputable physician would ever make such an absolute promise.

"I can't say with complete certainty, but the preliminary research suggests—"

"Then we're done here." Dominic's voice dropped to a dangerous calm.

"Contact me again only when you have definitive proof of success." The finality in his words struck Zoe like a physical blow.

"Dominic!" Her voice cracked. "Are you... abandoning Sophia's treatment? Or have you found someone more qualified?" The unspoken fear that he'd discovered her deception about the previous surgeries made her palms sweat.

Yet if he knew the truth, why would he have called her about Sophia's condition just last night?

"This isn't about qualifications." Dominic's voice lost all warmth. "Zoe, the funds I provided could have secured your future. Instead, you chose to invest in Thornfield Industries."

Evelyn Thorne's resentment toward him wasn't solely about his past choices to protect his secrets. The presence of Zoe and Margaret between them had been equally destructive.

A sleepless night at Sophia's bedside had given Dominic painful clarity. The more he reflected, the more he understood Evelyn's suffering. While he couldn't undo the past, he refused to repeat the same mistakes.

Zoe's quiet sobs filled the silence. "I didn't realize... how deeply you still cared for Evelyn Thorne."

"You knew." Dominic's brutal honesty shattered her pretense.

Zoe hadn't anticipated such merciless directness.

"There's no reason for further contact, Zoe."

The clinical detachment in Dominic's tone made it crueler than any outburst. Zoe attempted a bitter laugh, but no sound emerged.

Just days ago, she'd boasted to Margaret about extracting another hundred fifty-five million from Dominic. Was this karma for her greed? Or was she simply reaping what Dominic had sown by never offering even basic affection?

The call disconnected with finality.

Zoe collapsed against her steering wheel, hot tears scalding her cheeks. Dominic no longer needed her. She had nothing left. The drive home passed in a numb haze.

She only realized her mistake when she found herself standing outside Margaret and her father's penthouse.

"Zoe? What's happened?" Margaret's sharp eyes took in her stepdaughter's disheveled appearance with calculated interest.

"It's over." Zoe's voice broke. "Dominic has chosen Evelyn Thorne's side completely!"

Margaret's expression darkened. "If you don't act now, that pregnancy will destroy any remaining chance you have."

Zoe's tear-filled eyes met Margaret's. "He's cutting ties with me because of her! He'd rather halt Sophia's treatment than continue working with me!"

Margaret handed her a tissue with surprising gentleness. "Stop crying. I have a solution, but I'll need your cooperation."

This time, Zoe didn't ask for details. "Anything. Just make Evelyn Thorne suffer."
###Chapter 494

The days melted away like snow in spring.

Tomorrow would be Children's Day, coinciding with Evelyn's crucial prenatal appointment.

She had lived in constant fear that this pregnancy wouldn't survive.

The cocktail of medications she'd taken during those early weeks haunted her thoughts.

Yet against all odds, the little life inside her clung stubbornly to existence.

If tomorrow's tests went well, the hospital would officially establish her maternity records.

"Will Dominic be joining you for the appointment tomorrow, Evelyn?" Michael asked between bites of his salad.

"Don't you have plans? I'm perfectly capable of going alone," Evelyn replied, swirling her spoon through the soup.

Michael arched an eyebrow. "Dominic isn't accompanying you?"

"I don't require his presence. Or yours. Unless you want people assuming you're the father."

"At least take the housekeeper then."

"She needs to watch the children. Go enjoy your date without worrying about me," Evelyn said before taking another sip.

"My appointment's at ten. I should be finished by noon."

"Understood," Michael murmured, fingers dancing across his phone screen.

Less than two minutes later, he looked up with a smirk. "Change of plans. Dominic will be joining you tomorrow!"

Evelyn set down her spoon with deliberate calm. "Nathan told you this?"

Michael nodded. "Probably didn't mention it because he knew you'd refuse."

The phone rang before five minutes had passed. Dominic's name illuminated the screen. Evelyn excused herself to the living room.

"I'll meet you at St. Elizabeth's tomorrow morning," Dominic declared, his tone brooking no argument.

Evelyn's protest died unspoken. Any refusal would only make him more determined.

"Fine," she conceded after a weighted pause.

"Dinner tomorrow night. You wanted to see Sophia? I'll bring her along." His voice dropped to that velvet register that always unsettled her.

"Bring the children too. It's Children's Day after all."

"Dominic—"

She barely began her objection when Sophia's cheerful voice interrupted.

"Who's that? Is it Evelyn? Let me talk to her!"

"Sophia wants to speak with you," Dominic relayed before handing over the phone.

Evelyn's defenses crumbled at the girl's excited chatter. After hanging up, she approached the children's play area.

"How would you two like to see Sophia tomorrow? We could have dinner together."

Anticipating resistance, she added gently, "She's been unwell recently."

Lily's expression softened immediately. "Of course! I want to get her a present! She always brings us gifts."

Henry remained silent, which Evelyn knew meant reluctant agreement.

After hesitating, she added, "Dominic Blackwood will be joining us."

Both children's eyes widened, but neither protested. Their unreadable expressions puzzled her.

Later that night, after lights out, the siblings whispered in the dark.

"I don't want to have dinner with That Man," Lily pouted.

"Mom needs this," Henry replied quietly.

Though he despised Dominic more than his sister, Henry understood the delicate balance of Evelyn's condition.

"Will the baby live with us?" Lily wondered aloud.

"Don't know."

"Sometimes I want it to, sometimes not... I don't want it taking my things, but I don't want it stuck with him either."

"Sleep now."

Henry cared only for his mother's happiness. Everything else was negotiable.

Dawn found Dominic's sleek car idling outside the manor hours early.

Though he'd claimed he'd meet her at the hospital, sleep had proven impossible.

Evelyn too had risen before the sun. Drawing back the curtains, she blinked against the golden light.

There, haloed by morning, stood the unmistakable silhouette she'd know anywhere.
###Chapter 495

Dominic stood motionless at the wrought iron gates of Evelyn's estate, his broad shoulders casting a long shadow in the early morning light.

Evelyn's pulse quickened as she spotted him from her bedroom window. She scrambled back to her nightstand, grabbing her phone to check for missed calls or messages. Nothing. Not a single notification from him all morning.

How long had he been waiting there? What brought him here at this ungodly hour? Would he have remained there silently if she hadn't noticed him? Evelyn hastily pulled a cream-colored sundress from her closet and hurried downstairs.

The heavy oak door creaked open, revealing Dominic's piercing gaze. His hawk-like eyes swept over her as she stepped onto the porch.

Dominic glanced at his platinum wristwatch. "Seven fifteen," he noted, his voice rough with fatigue. "You're up early for someone who should be resting."

Evelyn walked down the garden path, the morning dew dampening her sandals. "What are you doing here?" she asked, taking in his disheveled appearance. The dark circles under his eyes told their own story.

"Came to drive you to your appointment," he rasped, clearing his throat. "You should go back to bed."

"I'm wide awake now," Evelyn countered, crossing her arms against the morning chill.

"Breakfast then?" Dominic suggested, his stomach growling audibly.

"I'm fasting for the bloodwork," Evelyn reminded him.

Dominic's jaw tightened. "Then let's get to the hospital." He didn't want her going too long without food.

Evelyn nodded and ducked back inside for her purse. When she returned, she slid into the passenger seat without buckling up. "We're going to St. Elizabeth Medical Center."

"Fine." Dominic's immediate agreement surprised her.

This was Wesley Ashford's workplace, and Evelyn vividly remembered the tension between the two men.

The car purred to life as Evelyn fastened her seatbelt. The streets were still empty at this hour.

They arrived before eight. Wesley was already waiting in the lobby, clipboard in hand. "We'll start with bloodwork," he announced, leading them toward the phlebotomy station.

Evelyn leaned toward Dominic as they walked. "Did you ask Wesley to come in this early?"

"He told me to text when we were on our way," Dominic murmured back.

"You've been in contact?" Evelyn's eyebrows shot up.

"For some time now." Dominic's reply made her think of Professor Sebastian Whitmore.

Time had a way of smoothing over old rivalries. Evelyn had nearly forgotten that Dominic knew the renowned neurologist long before she did - back when he'd moved heaven and earth trying to find treatment for Sophia.

By noon, the battery of tests was complete. Wesley invited them to his townhouse for lunch.

Wesley's mother took one look at Dominic and beamed. "Such a distinguished gentleman, Mr. Blackwood. If I were Evelyn, I'd choose you too."

Two spots of color appeared on Dominic's cheeks. Evelyn felt heat creeping up her neck.

"Mother, please," Wesley groaned. "Their situation isn't what you think."

The older woman chuckled. "With your emotional intelligence, no wonder you're still single. Why else would they be having a baby together?"

Wesley opened and closed his mouth like a fish.

Evelyn shifted uncomfortably, about to explain. Then she felt Dominic's warm hand close over hers beneath the table. A jolt of electricity shot up her arm, setting her entire body aflame.
###Chapter 496

Evelyn's mind went completely blank. All the words she had prepared vanished in an instant.

"They're not even trying to deny it! How amusing!" Wesley's mother teased with a laugh.

Wesley ran his fingers through his hair, clearly uncomfortable, before hastily changing the subject.

"The blood test results should be ready by the time we finish lunch."

Evelyn gave a small nod, then focused on her meal, keeping her gaze lowered.

After their meal, Evelyn insisted Wesley didn't need to accompany her back to St. Elizabeth Medical Center for the results. She already felt guilty for troubling him that morning.

Since Wesley's home was near the hospital, Evelyn and Dominic walked together through the bustling streets.

"Why didn't you explain earlier? Do you enjoy keeping people guessing?" she quipped, raising an eyebrow.

"We're not particularly close to Mrs. Ashford, so there was no point in arguing," Dominic replied, his sharp eyes scanning their surroundings as they walked.

"You might not be close to her, but I am."

"Since you know her so well, you can clarify things whenever you want."

When the pedestrian light turned green, Dominic instinctively reached for Evelyn's hand to guide her across the busy intersection.

"I can manage on my own," Evelyn said, pulling her hand away sharply.

She shot him an icy glare before adding, "The only connection between us is that you're the father of my child. Don't expect me to acknowledge anything more."

"Whether you acknowledge it or not, the fact remains," Dominic countered, his voice steady.

"This arrangement is all we need." Evelyn had no response to that.

At the hospital, they collected her test results from the reception desk.

Evelyn carefully examined each report, her brow furrowed in concentration.

"How are they? Everything alright?" Dominic asked, unable to hide his concern.

"What exactly are you asking about?" Evelyn responded without looking up.

"Are these results for you or the baby?"

Dominic wasn't familiar with medical reports, especially when they involved two lives in one body.

Evelyn's head snapped up. "The baby's barely formed! We can only monitor its condition through ultrasounds right now."

"I see. So the blood work is normal then?"

"The tests for syphilis and gonorrhea will take another week," Evelyn said dismissively, shoving the papers into her bag.

Dominic recoiled slightly before composing himself. "There's no way you could have contracted those diseases."

"Oh? So now I'm some paragon of virtue?" Evelyn scoffed.

"Thanks for the compliment, but your promiscuity could still affect me regardless of how virtuous I am."

Dominic was rendered speechless.

"I'm taking a cab home," Evelyn announced abruptly.

"You can go now!"

She pulled out her phone and began booking a ride-hailing service.

Dominic should have stopped her, should have insisted on driving her home himself.

But her words had struck deeper than he cared to admit, leaving him momentarily stunned.

By the time he regained his composure, Evelyn had already walked away.

The accusation burned. He underwent annual medical checkups and was in perfect health, free from any such diseases. Yet Evelyn still doubted him.

That afternoon, Evelyn enjoyed a peaceful nap.

When she awoke and checked her phone, the clock showed 5 PM. Remembering their dinner plans with Dominic, she threw off the covers and hurried to get ready.

The door to the children's room stood ajar, and Lily's laughter drifted into the hallway.

Evelyn stepped inside to find complete chaos. Her eyebrows shot up in dismay.

Lily's clothes, usually neatly stored in the closet, were now strewn across every surface. Among them lay a white, puffy dress - last year's birthday gift from Sophie.

It was Lily's absolute favorite, the dress she reserved for special occasions.

Was she wearing it today because it was Children's Day... or because she was seeing her father tonight? The thought made Evelyn swallow any reprimand about the mess. She'd always known Lily had a soft spot for Dominic.

Few could resist a man who was both devastatingly handsome and extraordinarily successful, after all.
###Chapter 497

Though Dominic had a past with Zoe Montgomery, his romantic history was far less scandalous than most men of his stature.

At precisely six o'clock, Evelyn Thorne arrived at the upscale restaurant with Lily and Henry in tow, following the location Dominic had texted her the previous evening.

Dominic had secured the most exclusive private dining room in the establishment.

When Evelyn gave the room number at reception, a sharply dressed waiter immediately escorted them upstairs.

Lily gasped the moment they entered. "Mommy! It's like a fairy tale in here!"

The entire space had been transformed into a magical wonderland for Children's Day.

Dozens of colorful balloons floated near the ceiling, twinkling lights draped artfully across the walls, and an entire corner was piled high with beautifully wrapped presents.

"What's inside all these boxes, Mommy?" Lily asked, already reaching for the nearest gift.

"They're just decorations, sweetheart," Evelyn began, but the waiter quickly corrected her.

"Actually, Miss Thorne, Mr. Blackwood personally selected gifts for each box. They're all Children's Day presents for you and your children."

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

She opened her mouth but found herself speechless.

"Miss Thorne, Mr. Blackwood instructed us to begin serving dinner if you arrived before him," the waiter continued. "Shall we start now?"

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "We'll wait for him."

It didn't feel right to begin without Dominic, especially when he was treating them.

Besides, the table already overflowed with fresh fruit, delicate pastries, and an assortment of gourmet snacks.

"Very well. I'll be right outside if you need anything," the waiter said before discreetly exiting.

Lily practically vibrated with excitement over the presents, but Henry grabbed her wrist.

"I just want to look!" Lily whined, her lower lip trembling dramatically.

"Rich guys always know how to buy affection," Henry muttered darkly. "You'll fall for whatever junk he picked out."

Seeing her daughter's crestfallen expression, Evelyn intervened. "Henry, whatever Dominic bought, we can always reciprocate. Let Lily open them - today's supposed to be fun!"

Lily squealed with delight when her mother gave permission.

"I promise I'll just look, Mommy! I won't keep anything!"

Evelyn helped her daughter with the first package, revealing an incredibly detailed miniature fighter jet.

The craftsmanship was museum-quality.

Lily immediately carried it to Henry. "See? You said I'd like everything, but this is totally for you!"

The next gift contained a sparkling tiara adorned with rainbow-colored gemstones - exactly the sort of glittery accessory Lily adored.

There were eighteen presents in total - eight clearly meant for a boy, eight for a girl.

After opening several, Evelyn checked her watch and froze.

Seven o'clock. No Dominic.

The children had grown restless, nibbling halfheartedly on snacks while waiting.

Beautiful gifts aside, how could Dominic stand them up like this? Evelyn's stomach twisted as she dialed his number.

The call connected after several rings.

"Dominic..." she started.

Before she could ask about traffic or emergencies, Zoe Montgomery's tearful voice cut through the line.

"Dominic, if Evelyn hadn't killed our baby... he'd be celebrating today too!" Zoe sobbed hysterically. "Have you forgotten our son? He looked just like you! How could you forget him?!"

Evelyn's vision blurred as a high-pitched ringing filled her ears. The phone nearly slipped from her suddenly numb fingers.
###Chapter 498

Dominic didn't show up for dinner because he was with Zoe. This wasn't what hurt Evelyn the most.

The sharpest pain came from remembering Dominic and Zoe had once shared a child together.

What's worse, Zoe had accused Evelyn of murdering that child...

And Dominic had believed her.

If not for that, Evelyn wouldn't be carrying his baby now.

Tears welled up in her eyes. She hung up the phone as her legs went weak.

She gripped the edge of the dining table for support.

When Lily and Henry noticed their mother's distress, they immediately rushed to her side.

"Mommy! What happened?" Lily's eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

"Is he not coming, Mommy?" Henry guessed correctly, his small hands balling into fists.

"Don't cry, Mommy. Let's go home!"

Evelyn swallowed hard, forcing down her emotions. "You must be hungry. Let's find somewhere else to eat."

Both children shook their heads vigorously.

"I'm not hungry! Just angry..." Lily's voice trembled as her tiny frame shook with emotion.

She had picked her favorite sparkly dress for tonight. Even bought a special gift for Sophia.

Her excitement for this family dinner had been sky-high.

Now they'd been stood up. Dominic Blackwood was a liar. So was Sophia!

"Let's get food, Mommy." Henry suggested gently, worried about his mother.

Evelyn nodded and led them out of the private dining room.

The waitress panicked at their sudden departure. "Ms. Thorne! Your dinner hasn't been served yet! Should I have the kitchen start now? Everything's prepared..."

Evelyn paused briefly. "It's fine."

The confused waitress hesitated. "The gifts in the room, Ms. Thorne. If they're inconvenient to carry, we can deliver them to your address."

"No need." Evelyn walked away with her children.

The manager immediately called Dominic to report the situation.

"Ms. Thorne's daughter was crying."

Dominic was speeding back toward Ravenshore City when the call came.

His voice turned gravelly. "And her?"

The manager understood. "Ms. Thorne didn't cry, but her eyes were red. Might break down later... Her son looked furious though."

Dominic visualized the scene perfectly.

His own eyes burned with unshed tears.

That afternoon, Zoe had called about finding a doctor who could help Sophia.

She claimed this doctor - another of Professor Whitmore's students - had reviewed Sophia's third treatment and had more experience than her.

After consideration, Dominic agreed to take Sophia for consultation.

The doctor was vacationing near a remote tourist spot, two hours from the city center.

But shortly after meeting, Zoe had an emotional breakdown. She ranted about all her efforts for Sophia's treatment. Sobbed about Dominic avoiding her despite her love.

Dominic hadn't forgotten his dinner plans.

They'd left at 4:30pm to return to the city. Zoe asked for a ride, which seemed reasonable.

The drive had been peaceful until Evelyn's call.

That call triggered Zoe's outburst. Dominic never expected her to lose control like that, leaving him momentarily stunned into silence.
###Chapter 499

The call ended abruptly, leaving Dominic stunned in the driver's seat. His hands tightened around the steering wheel as realization dawned. With a violent jerk, he slammed the brakes.

"Get out!" His voice cut through the tense silence like a whip.

Sophia flinched beside him. In the backseat, Zoe Montgomery was a weeping mess.

Zoe knew the command was meant for her, but she clung to the hope of reaching the city first.

"Don't test me, Zoe!" Dominic's dark eyes burned with barely restrained fury as they locked onto hers in the rearview mirror.

Her face drained of color.

The car door flew open before she could react.

Before it even closed properly, the luxury vehicle shot forward like a bullet into the night.

Twenty minutes later, Dominic stormed into the private dining room at Villa Serenade.

The manager gestured nervously to the scattered gifts. "They opened everything but left them all behind."

Dominic's throat constricted as he took in the unwrapped presents. His vision blurred momentarily.

"They did enjoy some of the fruits and desserts," the manager added hastily. "And we offered multiple times to serve dinner early—"

Dominic raised a hand sharply, silencing him.

Evelyn wasn't angry about the delay. This was about Zoe's poisonous words.

He guided Sophia to the lavishly set table. "Serve dinner now."

The staff sprang into action, clearing the remnants of snacks and preparing the main courses.

Within minutes, the table groaned under an extravagant spread.

Sophia stared at the feast without appetite. "Call Evelyn, Dominic."

"She won't answer." He knew Evelyn's temperament all too well.

Beneath her gentle exterior lay an iron will. Apologizing would require more than a phone call.

"But she's upset!" Sophia insisted. "Call her. Now."

Relenting, Dominic dialed Evelyn's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable."

Exactly as predicted. Even if he went to Mooncrest Manor now, she'd never open the door.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and the children returned home after dinner.

The manor stood dark and silent.

Michael Sterling was still out with Nathan Cross on their date.

Evelyn flipped the light switches, flooding the foyer with warm light.

"I hid presents for you in the living room," she announced with forced cheer. "Go find them!"

Lily and Henry squealed with delight, immediately beginning their treasure hunt.

Their joyful shouts filled the house as they discovered their gifts.

Just as wrapping paper began flying, headlights swept across the front yard.

Evelyn peered through the curtains. Michael's car.

He already knew what happened. Dominic had called him.

Though Dominic wasn't entirely at fault, Michael's loyalty remained firmly with Evelyn.

"You're home early," Evelyn remarked as he entered.

"Ah, Nathan had... things." Michael scratched his head awkwardly. "Go rest. I'll handle the kids."

Evelyn noticed his evasive glance but didn't press. She retreated to her bedroom.

The moment the door closed, the dam broke. Hot tears streamed down her face.

Lily's tear-streaked face and Henry's disappointed eyes haunted her.

She could give them endless love, but never replace what they truly lacked - a father's love. And Dominic Blackwood could never provide that.
###Chapter 500

In the dimly lit living room, Lily buried her face against Michael's chest, her small frame trembling with quiet sobs. "Dominic Blackwood never came," she whispered, her voice breaking. "We waited and waited...Mommy only found out he wasn't coming when she called him...She took us to another restaurant instead."

Michael tightened his arms around the little girl, his heart aching as he stroked her back. "Don't cry, sweetheart. This is all his fault! We'll never have dinner with him again!"

Tears streamed down Lily's cheeks as she nodded fiercely. "Yes! Never again! And I won't let Mommy eat with him either!"

"That's my brave girl," Michael murmured, pressing a kiss to her forehead while silently cursing Dominic's name. While other children were celebrating Children's Day with laughter and joy, his precious ones were heartbroken at home.

That absolute bastard!

Dominic probably thought he'd just missed one dinner, but he had no idea the devastation he'd caused. Michael suggested taking them out to cheer them up, but both children shook their heads dejectedly.

After playing with them for a while, Michael helped the children get ready for bed. Normally, Lily would resist bedtime with all her might, but tonight she climbed obediently under the covers after her bath. Michael turned off the lights with a heavy heart and stepped into the hallway.

His gaze drifted toward Evelyn's bedroom door. She was likely still awake. As a pregnant woman, she shouldn't be bottling up her emotions. He needed to check on her.

Michael knocked softly before pushing the door open. Darkness greeted him, broken only by the hallway light spilling across the bed where Evelyn lay curled on her side, seemingly asleep. She never went to bed this early. Even if she was pretending, he wouldn't disturb her. Closing the door quietly, he returned to his own room.

His phone buzzed with messages from Nathan, inquiring about Evelyn's condition. Each notification only fueled Michael's frustration.

Michael: [Did your boss put you up to this? What kind of man sends his assistant to do his dirty work? Tell him to come see for himself if he's so concerned!]

Nathan: [Can we talk?]

Michael: [Not in the mood! I can't believe Evelyn ever got involved with such scum!]

When Nathan called anyway, Michael answered with a growl. "Look outside...I think my boss might be there," Nathan said carefully. "His bodyguard mentioned a major accident caused traffic delays. Otherwise he wouldn't have been late."

"Is that supposed to excuse everything?" Michael snapped. "He told me everything. This is about Zoe Montgomery."

"But he's already cut all ties with her!" Nathan insisted. "He's not letting Zoe treat Sophia anymore. I didn't mention it earlier because I thought it was the right thing to do."

Some of Michael's anger dissipated.

"Zoe called today about introducing a new specialist...Mr. Blackwood may not want Zoe involved anymore, but if there's any chance to help Sophia, he'll take it," Nathan pleaded. "Please just check outside. If he's there, could you let him in?"

Michael's jaw tightened. "No promises. Evelyn and the kids are asleep." As he spoke, he glanced out the window.

There, parked outside the gate like a shadow, was Dominic's sleek black car. Dominic himself stood motionless before the gate, his intense gaze fixed on Evelyn's darkened window, as still as the night itself.

If Nathan's story held truth, perhaps Dominic wasn't entirely beyond redemption. Not that it was Michael's place to decide - forgiveness was Evelyn's choice alone.

With a sigh, Michael opened the front door and approached the gate. At his movement, Dominic seemed to come alive, his posture straightening.

"You should go," Michael said through the wrought iron bars. "They're all asleep. Save your explanations for tomorrow."
